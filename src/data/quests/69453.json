Rain or shine! Even if they trundle across the blazing sands of Amh Araeng, our inventions need to keep on keeping on!"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"We need sturdy components. <span class=\"emphasis\">Heat-resistant</span> components. Components that won't melt and droop because we had no idea just how ferocious the desert sun could be."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"We need you─and your experience with arid conditions─to craft us a robust example we can work from. Shigitt will provide you with the raw materials."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Come to help with those heat-resistant components, have you? Wonderful. We Tholls hail from cooler climes, as you know, and we could certainly use your insight."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Here. I've selected some promising materials─let's see you forge three cogwheels that won't warp or bend when the going gets hot. If you decide to scrap it and try again, you can poke Ronitt's automaton for extra crafting supplies."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Here. I've selected some promising materials─let's see you make three insulation covers that'll protect a tank's insides from overheating.
