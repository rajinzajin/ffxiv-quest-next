Are you feeling unwell?"},{"name":"METEION","text":"It's not me, Hermes. It's you..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"I won't go to the meeting. I'll stay with <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Loath though I am to impose, may I leave Meteion in your care again?"},{"name":"HERMES","text":"I'm in your debt. If you'll excuse me..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Can you help me with something, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"METEION","text":"The meeting will make Hermes sad. I want to cheer him up. With a flower."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Hermes likes flowers the most. Of all the creations in Elpis."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Most creations are expected to be interesting. Or beautiful. Or strong. Better in some way."},{"name":"METEION","text":"But flowers are different. They're designed to suit our emotions. What we feel and want to convey. Hermes likes that."},{"name":"METEION","text":"I can't make flowers. So I'll search for one. And I want you to search with me."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Let's start here. At the Twelve Wonders."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Meteion is now accompanying you. Keep her at your side in order to proceed with quest objectives."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You can leave Meteion behind by entering a different area, or by speaking with her and selecting the option to part ways."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"If you wish to have Meteion accompany you again, return and speak with her at the original location."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you do?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Talk."},{"name":"A1","text":"Part ways."},{"name":"A1","text":"Nothing."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Let's search the Twelve Wonders first."},{"name":"Q2","text":"Are you sure you wish to part ways with Meteion?"},{"name":"METEION","text":"All right! I'll wait at the building."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Hermes is still talking. We still have time!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Meteion has yet to arrive. Be sure she is at your side before you examine the flowers."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You should have Meteion accompanying you before you examine the flowers."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Vibrant purple flowers bigger than your hands adorn the tree."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Oooh, so big and bright! I love them!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"...But they might be too bright. You have to think of the recipient. That's what Hermes said."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Let's head outside next. Don't worry─we won't wander far."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"A tall, slender tree rises before you. You crane your neck to look for flowers."},{"name":"METEION","text":"No flowers... If there were apples, we could've covered them in syrup..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Let's head outside next. Don't worry─we won't wander far."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Lots of flowers in the fields. We should be able to find something nice!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You should have Meteion accompanying you before you look for flowers."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"An array of beautiful flowers grow in the bed, their mix of colors forming a pattern."},{"name":"METEION","text":"These would be better for Hermes...but they're hedged in."},{"name":"METEION","text":"That means we shouldn't touch them. They're either under observation or poisonous."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Any other place should be fine, though. Let's keep looking!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"Vibrant or subdued...? Interesting or plain...? Hmmm..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Set on a tall, thin stalk, the oddly shaped flower is mesmerizing in its undulations..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Oh, a coneion! A flower that can move!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"When Hermes wasn't looking, it shot seeds at him. Not a good gift, maybe..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"But you're good, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─at spotting flowers! We'll find something soon!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"You're good at observing, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Just like an observer!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You spy nothing promising nearby. At best, common-looking grasses with some few tiny flowers..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Hmmm, nothing around here... Ah!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"Over there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Something big! Huge!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"Come on, let's get closer! But not too close!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"A terrible stench reminiscent of sodden old boots pervades the air... Without a doubt, the culprit is the morbol-like creature before you."},{"name":"METEION","text":"It's an adonis! The things around its mouth look like petals. But the flowers are the orbs on its head!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"When Hermes inspected it, it swallowed him up. He didn't leave his room for days. What do you think, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? Would he like it?"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"It's probably not the good sort of memory..."},{"name":"A3","text":"I'd rather not go near that thing..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"So not this one either..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Finding a good flower... It's harder than I thought."},{"name":"METEION","text":"I'm sorry, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but could we search a little more? Maybe as far as the fields over there. I'll pick something after that, I promise."},{"name":"METEION","text":"I've never given a gift before... Were you nervous too? For your first time?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Lush, green fields stretch out before you, ending where the sky begins..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Awww... There's nothing..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"...Hm? The shiny thing over there. What could it be?"},{"name":"METEION","text":"I learned something new recently─the meaning of Philomythes Notos! "},{"name":"METEION","text":"“Notos” is a south wind person...and “Philomythes” is his joy! Why is he joyful? Because this place is so beautiful!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"Ooh, Elpis flowers! They're here too!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"Hermes likes and dislikes them. At the same time."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Like me, they're entelechies. Like me, they feel his pain and turn dark..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"That's only for Hermes, though. For others, they're always white and bright."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Truly!? The flower was dark in your home!?"},{"name":"METEION","text":"Then...do you have it too? A dark emotion?"},{"name":"Q4","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A4","text":"I've known the pain and sorrow of loss."},{"name":"A4","text":"I've felt great fury and frustration."},{"name":"A4","text":"I've been plagued by doubt and anxiety."},{"name":"A4","text":"I daresay I have a few."},{"name":"METEION","text":"I see..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Hermes has known the same. The feeling that a part of you is gone. Again and again. But no one notices..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Please, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Won't you lend it to me? Your pain and sorrow..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"I see..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Hermes has felt the same. A fire burning in your breast. A trembling hand. But no one understands..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Please, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Won't you lend them to me? Your fury and frustration..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"I see..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Hermes has felt the same. A shortness of breath. The walls closer and closer. But only him. No one else feels it..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Please, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Won't you lend them to me? Your doubt and anxiety..."},{"name":"METEION","text":"You don't have to say it. I can feel it's something you want to hide."},{"name":"METEION","text":"But won't you lend it to me? The darkness inside you?"},{"name":"METEION","text":"I want you to make the flower dark. In front of Hermes."},{"name":"METEION","text":"He has been in a dark place. Since before he created me. He needs to know that he isn't there alone. That others are sad too."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Truly? You'll do it?"},{"name":"METEION","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Thank you! It means more to me than I can say!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"I can't wait to see how Hermes reacts! Let's go back and fetch him!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"It seems they're still talking.
