Approach the Vath storyteller and barter for information.","The storyteller welcomes you to the hive, and willingly relates the circumstances that led to the summoning of his tribe's predictably crystal-hungry primal. Unfortunately, nothing the Vath leader tells you offers any clue as to how you might go about defeating the insatiable creature..."],"objectives":["Speak with the Vath fleetfoot.","Speak with the Vath storyteller."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well, everything appears to be in order. Assuming no one has any objections to my choice of presentation, I shall place our offerings at the trading post as instructed. Were I of the Gnath, I think I would be suitably impressed."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well? How long must we wait? Should we have sounded a signal or some such?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Calm yourself, Master Alphinaud. Our offering has not gone unnoticed."},{"name":"IDATEN","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Long has it been since hunters last came to trade, bearing gifts that filled the air with such delightful scents."},{"name":"NANKAEATER","text":"(-Excited Gnath-)Landtrap nectar!"},{"name":"IDATEN","text":"(-Exultant Gnath-)Caelumtree fruit!"},{"name":"IDATEN","text":"(-Gnath Trio-)And nanka flesh!"},{"name":"IDATEN","text":"What delectable foods you have brought for us. Our meager existence is much enriched by your bounty."},{"name":"IDATEN","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Come, hunters. Come to our hive if you would trade.

Come, come, it is not far."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Can those truly be Gnath? Were it not for their appearance, I would think them wholly unrelated to the savage creatures that attacked us on the road."},{"name":"ICEHEART","text":"These Gnath seem harmless enough. Almost jovial, even. I would prefer, however, that we conclude our business with them as soon as possible."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"...Strangely friendly, are they not? Or mayhap just strange."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"When I set out to master the dragoon's jump, 'twas not to strike fear into the hearts of high-hanging fruit."},{"name":"ICEHEART","text":"Master Alphinaud possesses a rare talent for the arcane arts. Should he continue to apply himself to their study, he will become a formidable mage in time."},{"name":"IDATEN","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Your presence has been announced to the storyteller.

My companions and I are come in search of knowledge─specifically, knowledge of your people's god."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"Knowledge alone? What strange hunters you are! But if it is words you desire, then words you shall have! We are the Vath─the Nonmind─and to speak is our fate!"},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"You will hear the tale of the Gnath's god─of the god the Onemind summoned into our midst."},{"name":"ICEHEART","text":"The “Onemind”...these are the Gnath who reside in the main colony?"},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"Yes, they are one. <span class=\"emphasis\">Connected</span>.

It fell from the sky and into the hive, where it was swarmed by my brethren. And with spear, and spell, and musket, the dragon was slain."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"'Twas likely one that had fled battle with my kinsmen. I should commend you for finishing the job."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"Dragons are fierce and terrible adversaries. The Onemind would always cower when their winged shadows passed over the ground. But no longer─they had learned that a battle-weary Dravanian was easy prey."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"Thus did the Overmind decide to heed the words of the black-robed men. The Onemind would call forth our god, and unleash His blades upon the dragons..."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"Dravanian lands would become Gnath lands, and ever larger would grow our domain."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"But our god ever hungers.
