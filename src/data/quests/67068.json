When life hands you a lemon, make lemoncakes─deliver the missive to Gegeruju's beach paradise in eastern La Noscea, and try to enjoy the journey.","The envelope you delivered contains a blunt refusal from the dancing master Guillaunaux, who Master Gegeruju had sought to employ for the purpose of bringing the forefront of artistic expression to Costa del Sol. Fortunately for the enterprising entrepreneur, Guillaunaux saw fit to introduce another dance instructor who may prove more accommodating. Carry the contract drafted by Gegeruju to this esteemed personage, who may be found in outer La Noscea.","The mysterious dance instructor is revealed to be none other than Bugaal Ja, a Mamool Ja whose questionable behavior while bathing has earned him the scorn and disgust of many a smoothskin. Deeply moved to have found a patron who would pay the proper respect to his people's tradition, Bugaal Ja eagerly consents to the terms offered. Before setting off for Costa del Sol, however, he must prepare himself according to Mamool Ja custom. Seek him out at the Hermit's Hovel.","Bugaal Ja is eager to make for Costa del Sol and begin his dance instruction, but first he must purify his body according to Mamool Ja ritual─or rather, you must do it for him. Pour some sacred spring water over the Mamool Ja's body.","It would appear that a single dash of sacred spring water was not sufficient for the cleansing ritual. Repeat the process in hopes that a second splash will suffice.","Bugaal Ja grows more animated as he bathes in the soothing waters of the Hermit's Hovel, but it would appear the ritual is not yet complete. Douse him once more and see if the third time's the charm.","His body now cleansed to his satisfaction, Bugaal Ja sets out for Costa del Sol. Venture there yourself and inform Master Gegeruju that his dancing master is on his way.","Master Gegeruju informs you that his dancing master arrived a short while ago, and has already been introduced to his students. The dance lesson will begin momentarily, and you are invited to attend.","Bugaal Ja's undulations and gyrations proved a bit too vigorous for the aspiring dancers, who fled screaming from the lesson while it had barely begun. Speak with Master Gegeruju and hear his assessment of the entire ordeal.","While disheartened with the results, Master Gegeruju does not regret his endeavor to bring the vanguard of artistic expression to Costa del Sol. Nevertheless, it appears that it will still be some time before the average Eorzean can find it in himself to accept Mamool Ja custom. In the meantime, should the undulations of the erstwhile dancing master once more threaten to cause panic amongst the unwitting bath-goers of Bronze Lake, you know where your talents will be needed."],"objectives":["Deliver the letter to Gegeruju in Costa del Sol.","Deliver the contract to the vigorous dancer in outer La Noscea.","Speak with Bugaal Ja at the Hermit's Hovel.","Pour sacred spring water over Bugaal Ja.","Pour more sacred spring water over Bugaal Ja.","Pour yet more sacred spring water over Bugaal Ja.","Speak with Gegeruju at Costa del Sol.","Wait on the decks for the dance lesson to begin.","Report to Gegeruju."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"My hardworking assistant returns!
