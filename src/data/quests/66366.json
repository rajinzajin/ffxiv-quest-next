Carry word of his displeasure to U'tykha Tia.","After speaking with U'tykha Tia, you have learned that he is more concerned about the novice U'kahzuna's well-being than he is U'khuba Tia's opinion of him. To ensure that she has not been too wounded by U'khuba Tia's critiques, seek out U'kahzuna in the Minotaur Malm and inquire as to her mental state.","You arrive in the Minotaur Malm to find a new U'kahzuna, brimming with vigor. All she seems to require from you are three dune anglers. Proceed into the Sagolii Desert, and use empty angler-sized sacks on them once they have been sufficiently weakened.","You are now the proud owner of three sacks full of angry fish monsters. Deliver the catch to U'kahzuna in the Minotaur Malm.","A newly serene U'kahzuna has revealed that she is using the enfeebled anglers for archery practice on the advice of U'khuba Tia. Report this astonishing development to U'tykha Tia.","U'tykha Tia and U'khuba Tia─surprisingly alike in their devotion to the tribe, but malms apart in all else. Who will become the next nunh, and what will it mean for Forgotten Springs? One thing is for sure: armed with new focus forged by U'tykha Tia and a new weapon furnished by U'khuba Tia, U'kahzuna stalks a brighter future."],"objectives":["Speak with U'tykha Tia.

Been working together with U'tykha in his schemes, I've heard. I suppose I can hardly expect an adventurer to be loyal... But I <span class=\"emphasis\">can</span> expect you to stay out of U tribe affairs─especially when they concern the training of our young rangers."},{"name":"UKHUBATIA","text":"The fact that U'kahzuna has been naught but a disgrace to us is no excuse for your interference, no matter what U'tykha might believe. For the nonce, I've dispatched her to the Minotaur Malm, that she might reflect on her many flaws in solitude."},{"name":"UKHUBATIA","text":"But that will accomplish nothing by itself. This problem must be fixed at the source: U'tykha's foolish methods. Since you've gotten so close to the man, mayhap you'd be so kind as to tell him to refrain from corrupting <span class=\"emphasis\">other</span> impressionable novices."},{"name":"UTYKHATIA","text":"What's all this? U'khuba expects me to stay away from teaching our young ones? His foolish notions truly know no bounds. A true instructor does more than simply criticize his students when they fail."},{"name":"UTYKHATIA","text":"I continue to worry about how U'kahzuna fares following the repeated rebukes she has received from that onion-eyed troll. Who knows what damage he's wrought? Please, adventurer, seek her out so that we might determine her mental state."},{"name":"UKAHZUNA","text":"It's good to see you again! What's that? You're wondering how I'm doing? I'm fine! Don't worry yourself on my account. I have everything I need! ...Mostly. There is <span class=\"emphasis\">one</span> thing you could do for me."},{"name":"UKAHZUNA","text":"I need three anglers─alive, but enfeebled. I believe that when sufficiently weakened, they can be caught with simple sacks. Would you do me this favor?"},{"name":"UKAHZUNA","text":"Could you catch three anglers in those sacks? I'd appreciate it."},{"name":"UKAHZUNA","text":"These should do nicely. I switched to archery, you see. And I thought that anglers, a mite slowed, would make fine practice targets. It's interesting... I wouldn't have dreamed of picking up the bow before, but some things became clear to me after that Amalj'aa hunt..."},{"name":"UKAHZUNA","text":"When I returned from it and spoke with U'khuba, he suggested that I might be more suited to fighting at range. 'Twas he who showed me how to shoot. He even gave me these arrows─the heads are of yarzon barb."},{"name":"UKAHZUNA","text":"I am fortunate to have both U'khuba and U'tykha watching over me. We are a tribe, and what I take from others I wish to give back someday. <span class=\"emphasis\">That</span> is what I train for now─not to win praise or escape rebuke. Different though they may be, either U'tykha <span class=\"emphasis\">or</span> U'khuba would make a worthy nunh."},{"name":"UKAHZUNA","text":"Don't think I've grown <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> wise, though! Believe me, I'll still get a thrill and a half from putting arrows through these slimy monstrosities!"},{"name":"UTYKHATIA","text":"You have found U'kahzuna well, you say? And she's become an archer!? Why, that's brilliant! I can't believe I didn't think of it myself. And those yarzon barb arrowheads! U'khuba spent hours shaping those. Well, well..."},{"name":"UTYKHATIA","text":"I hate to admit it, but he is a better man than I gave him credit for. Still, he shall receive no quarter from me. I intend to lead this tribe, and it will be all the easier to beat him bloody if I keep my dislike of him intact."}],"reward":{"gil":1650,"xp":7600},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":31,"id":1}],"quests":[66365]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006288","obj":{"i":1006288,"n":"U'khuba Tia","l":45,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1006287","obj":{"i":1006287,"n":"U'tykha Tia","l":45,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1004917","obj":{"i":1004917,"n":"U'odh Nunh","l":45,"q":12}},{"type":"npc","id":"1006737","obj":{"i":1006737,"n":"U'kahzuna","l":45,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"66365","obj":{"i":66365,"n":"Mind Games","g":93,"l":"Southern Thanalan","s":310}}]}
