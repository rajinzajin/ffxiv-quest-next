Slay three wild dodos and three tiny mandragoras.","You have slain the designated creatures. Return to the Arcanists' Guild and report to Thubyrgeim.","Now that you have displayed your competence with Carbuncle, you are next to attempt an exercise that simulates the cargo inspections performed by Mealvaan's Gate assessors. Head south of the Zephyr Gate and examine the crates found near the cliffs.","You have defeated the creatures that lurked within the crates you were ordered to inspect. Now that the cargo is safe to handle, collect the contents and prepare to return to the guild.","Upon gathering the inspected cargo, you turn to find that your actions had been observed by a strange Miqo'te─Foreseer K'lyhia, a chief assessor for Mealvaan's Gate. As the elected supervisor for your training, the assessor happily appraises your performance, and offers instruction to further improve your arcanist abilities. With the exercise at an end, she bids you return to Thubyrgeim at the Arcanists' Guild.","You return to the guild and give your report of the day's lesson. Thubyrgeim explains that the strategically gifted K'lyhia was able to rise to her current position as foreseer using nothing more than an initiate's grimoire. Urging you to heed well the Miqo'te's advice, the acting guildmaster instructs you to continue your tactical training with Carbuncle.<br><br>※The next arcanist quest will be available from Thubyrgeim upon reaching level 10."],"objectives":["Slay wild dodos.","Slay tiny mandragoras.","Report to Thubyrgeim at the Arcanists' Guild.","Inspect the crates found south of the Zephyr Gate.","Collect the crates.","Report to Thubyrgeim at the Arcanists' Guild."],"dialogue":[{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, isn't it? Are you eating well? An empty stomach distracts the mind and leads to hurried judgment. I must oft remind my arcanists to take meals, so ensconced do they become in their studies."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Speaking of such, have you been practicing your tactics with Carbuncle? I believe it is time to assess the improvement of your skills. As with your previous trial, I would have you defeat foes in lower La Noscea─three wild dodos and three tiny mandragoras, to be precise."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Watch carefully the behavior of your opponents, formulate an effective strategy, and utilize your arcane entity to its fullest potential. I expect you back in time for <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">dinner</span><span class=\"alternative\">breakfast</span><span class=\"alternative\">lunch</span></span>."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Welcome back, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. It appears your coordination with Carbuncle is progressing at a satisfactory pace. Shall we test your growing acumen with a more practical examination?"},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Our work at Mealvaan's Gate requires us to inspect and record the contents of incoming cargo. To simulate such a task, I have had several crates transported to the cliff south of the Zephyr Gate."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"I want you to examine those crates, then return the inspected cargo here to me."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"You would be surprised at the depths to which some merchants will sink to deter our customs agents from performing thorough investigations. False bottoms, rotting foodstuffs, flesh-eating vilekin. I suggest you be prepared for any eventuality."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"(-???-)I am not a threat! Pray ignore my presence for the present and allow me a moment to cogitate."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"(-???-)The reaction to my sudden appearance was within expected parameters. But I must admit I did <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> expect so proficient a performance against the enemies set against you!"},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"(-???-)Yet, effective though your tactics were, I spied much room for improvement. As I watched you battle, the wheels of my mind whirled into motion, as they are wont to do, inventing other possible strategies you might have employed."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"(-???-)Let's see... Taking into account your current level of ability, factoring in the aetheric constant, multiplying by the number of opponents, then applying your tactics to other potential combat scenarios... Oh, dear. My calculations indicate failure upon encountering threat level 9,785."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"(-???-)Well! We'll have to see what we can do about that!"},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"Though the opportune window to do so has passed, I would nevertheless introduce myself: I am K'lyhia, a Mealvaan's Gate assessor."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"Acting Guildmaster Thubyrgeim elected me to oversee your training, and provide any necessary guidance and instruction in the field of arcanima."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"From what I have observed thus far, you have an admirable grasp of the fundamentals."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"I do, however, wish to confirm one small detail. Regarding your choice of arcane geometries, what factor most influences your actions during battle?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What factor most influences your actions?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Desire to outwit an enemy."},{"name":"A1","text":"Potential for amusement."},{"name":"A1","text":"I simply do what feels right."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Aha</span>! Just as I predicted. And now I have the final element needed to perform another calculation. Hmmm. The probability of you becoming an arcanist of note is...90%! Give or take half a percent."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"Yes, the certainty is quite high. After all, I only know of one other practitioner who responded to my question in the same manner."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"It was the man who bestowed upon me this grimoire─the guildmaster himself!"},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"While our inscrutable leader is, as I'm sure you've heard, on an indefinite leave of absence, he did leave us with his most notorious saying to date:"},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"“Strategy is a tool used to manipulate one's situation into the desired reality.”"},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"No matter how gifted you and I might be, however, the instantaneous manipulation of reality that might cause us to suddenly become mighty arcanists is beyond our present abilities. Discipline and experience is the finest strategy in this case."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"I suggest you continue to focus on refining your aptitude with Carbuncle. Mastery with an arcane entity will greatly improve your success as a wielder of arcanima!"},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"Here ends your lesson for today. Pray return directly to the guild─I believe Mistress Thubyrgeim is awaiting some inspected cargo."},{"name":"KLYHIA","text":"And what of myself? I'm off to the fields, of course! The tactics I reasoned out earlier must be attempted in real-life scenarios. Theory is all well and good, but there is no substitute for actual combat. We will meet again soon."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Have you returned with the cargo?"},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Yes, everything seems to be in order─relatively clear of blood and other gore. That can be something of a problem in our profession, you understand. I also had word from K'lyhia regarding your performance. She seemed eager to continue your training."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"An odd lass, I'll admit, but the guild can boast no finer mind for tactics. You would do well to heed the instruction she offers, particularly that which touches on the diligent approach to our art."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Did you perhaps notice the battered tome K'lyhia carries? That initiate's grimoire has served her from the day she entered the guild. She has her reasons, but it's admittedly strange to see it kept all the way to her present position as foreseer."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"I fear such an intense focus on arcanima has led her to overlook other important aspects of life... As our master strategist guides your arcanist training, I hope that you might return the favor and help to broaden her own perspective, somewhat."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"But enough of such matters for the moment. You have done well this day, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Continue your practice with Carbuncle, as K'lyhia has bid. I will be here when the time comes for your next lesson."},{"name":"POP","text":"You sense a hostile presence!"}],"reward":{"items":[{"id":2143},{"id":3007,"one":1},{"id":2655,"one":1},{"id":4421,"one":1},{"id":4091,"one":1},{"num":5,"id":5823,"one":1}],"xp":560},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":5,"id":27}],"questsType":"any","quests":[65989,65990]},"next":[65992,65993]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000909","obj":{"i":1000909,"n":"Thubyrgeim","l":29,"q":15,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"item","id":"2143","obj":{"i":2143,"n":"Leather Grimoire","l":5,"c":33402,"t":10,"p":219}},{"type":"item","id":"3007","obj":{"i":3007,"n":"Custom-made Robe of Casting","l":6,"c":42308,"t":35,"p":100}},{"type":"item","id":"2655","obj":{"i":2655,"n":"Hempen Hat","l":5,"c":41015,"t":34,"p":113}},{"type":"item","id":"4421","obj":{"i":4421,"n":"Bone Ring","l":9,"c":54432,"t":43,"p":132}},{"type":"item","id":"4091","obj":{"i":4091,"n":"Copper Wristlets","l":8,"c":55601,"t":42,"p":229}},{"type":"item","id":"5823","obj":{"i":5823,"n":"Allagan Tin Piece","l":5,"c":26001,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"65989","obj":{"i":65989,"n":"Way of the Arcanist","g":135,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":11,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"65990","obj":{"i":65990,"n":"My First Grimoire","g":135,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":12,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"65992","obj":{"i":65992,"n":"Tactical Planning","g":135,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":100,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"65993","obj":{"i":65993,"n":"Tactical Planning","g":135,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":100,"f":1}}]}
