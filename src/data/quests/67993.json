Let's go and find Meffrid."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I knew it wouldn't be easy, but..."},{"name":"MEFFRID","text":"Looks like the elder wasn't the only one unwilling to hear us out. Can't blame them, given what happened at the Wall."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I thought I might be able to appeal to them as a fellow...I don't know. But, if anything, it just made them angrier. I haven't lived through it like they have."},{"name":"MEFFRID","text":"I can't claim to know the struggle like they do either, Lyse. I ran too, aye, but if I hadn't, I'd've never met <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> or the rest of you, and we might not be here today, in a position to make a difference."},{"name":"MEFFRID","text":"So I don't regret my choices, nor will I apologize for them.

They took my brother, and our money!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Took him where?"},{"name":"BEWILDEREDWOMEN","text":"Ruins to the south of here. Was just an old temple before they came and...
