{"quest":{"name":"Everybody Was Fukumen Fighting","location":"Ul'dah","id":69526,"patch":5.41,"sort":630,"icon":101050,"unlocksFunction":1,"eventIcon":71341,"issuer":1035095,"target":1035096,"genre":166,"journal":["P'yandih appears to have been waiting for you.","P'yandih, otherwise applauded in the Celestium as “Azuro the Fourth,” appears to have been awaiting your arrival. After a brief greeting, she hands you a letter from Martyn─a missive from the mysterious Far East. You scan the plaintive note and learn that the guildmaster has encountered some manner of trouble, and requests assistance at your earliest convenience. It would seem that your path leads to a teahouse in front of the Sekiseigumi Barracks in Kugane...","You arrive in Kugane to find Martyn working in a teahouse, the odd conclusion to an unfortunate string of events that befell him not long after his own arrival in the city. Robbery and public indecency notwithstanding, the guildmaster assures you that he is finally able to set aside some time to pursue the true purpose of his journey. He would, however, appreciate any aid you can render during his investigation into the Fukumen Fighting Festival. To that end, you are to make your way to the Shiokaze Hostelry, and learn what information you may from the patrons within.","Your inquiries at the Shiokaze Hostelry have shed some light upon the nature of Kugane's own fighting arena. Return to Martyn and report your discoveries.","You share your information with Martyn, and he reluctantly concludes that obtaining a ticket to the festival will require dealing with a black market merchant. Follow the guildmaster into the back alleys of Kogane Dori.","The shifty merchant you encounter is none other than Gyodo, the Namazu responsible for robbing Martyn in the first place. In an act of contrition─and sniveling cowardice─Gyodo returns the guildmaster's stolen money, and also presents him with an entry token to the festival. A few coins richer, Martyn suggests an immediate visit to the castle gates, where a Fighting Festival ticket taker should be waiting to admit you to the show.","Although Gyodo appears to have deceived you with a cheap ticket, you nevertheless enter the festival and view the opening match. Martyn is appalled by the event's blatant similarities to the Masked Carnivale, and shocked to discover that the entrepreneurial combatant known as “Bluehood” speaks with the voice of Nutiba Buntiba. Before you can discover anything further, however, you are forced to exit the premises.","A furious Martyn decides to linger by the castle gates and wait for his dishonest disciple to emerge. Bluehood, when he eventually does appear, is adamant that he is not the person Martyn thinks he is. The festival's manager, Kageyama, then comes out to cut the guildmaster's tirade short. He challenges the “founder of blue magic” to prove the authenticity of his claims in a duel against the reigning champion, Golden Goliath─a proposal which Martyn recklessly accepts. Wondering at the wisdom of his decision, your erstwhile mentor hurries back to his post at the teahouse.","Committed to his course, Martyn wisely chooses to spend the time leading up to the exhibition match investigating the fighting style of his opponent. Meanwhile, he exhorts you to continue your training in preparation for the unlikely event that you will be required to take his place in the arena.<br><br>※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon reaching level 65 and learning Tingle."],"objectives":["Speak with Martyn in Kugane.","Question customers at the Shiokaze Hostelry.","Speak with Martyn.","Speak with Martyn once more.","Speak with the Fighting Festival ticket taker.","Speak with Martyn.","Speak with Martyn once more."],"dialogue":[{"name":"PYANDIH","text":"Wasn't there something Martyn thought you should learn before you came back to me?

Fin. Whatever."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Acceptin' his aid was the start of my misfortunes. The little bleeder had me knocked out, purse emptied, and stripped to the skin before I even knew what was happenin'."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"To add insult to injury, the local authorities' response to a befuddled, bare-bottomed man stumblin' about town is to lock him up on charges of public indecency."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I was able to plead innocence on that count, at least, but that still left me penniless, friendless, and naked as a newborn babe. The officers took pity on me then, and arranged a job for me here at the teahouse in exchange for food and board...once they'd lent me some clothes, of course."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I've since been spendin' every spare moment learnin' the ins and outs of the perfect cup of tea, but I think I've got the hang of it now. I can finally start nosin' into that Fukumen Fighting Festival, and, with your help, hopefully make up for lost time."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Right, then. I'll ask some questions around the teahouse, while you interrogate the clientele of the Shiokaze Hostelry. Gently, mind you!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Once you've ferreted out some choice bits of information, we can meet back here and compare notes. Let's get to it!"},{"name":"HABOKU","text":"I know more about drinking than fighting, but even I've heard about this festival of yours... They opened its doors only a short while ago, and the battling beasts it showcases are already drawing huge crowds."},{"name":"HABOKU","text":"The real stars, though, are the blue wizards. Their wild magicks bring the customers back again and again, like a smooth cup of sake."},{"name":"HAYATAKA","text":"...Do I <span class=\"emphasis\">know</span> of it? I've been to <span class=\"emphasis\">see</span> it.

Where's the entertainment in that?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I can understand the commonfolk lapping it up, but it seems that even the lord bugyo has fallen under its spell. Last I heard they were hosting matches in the Noh Theater up at the castle. Unbelievable..."},{"name":"HABOKU","text":"That's all I know about the festival, but should you have any questions about sake..."},{"name":"HAYATAKA","text":"Like I said, you might have trouble securing tickets to a match─especially if you're keen to see Golden Goliath. You either need to be extremely swift...or extremely rich."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"The theater was built as a stage to exhibit our traditional art forms, not this vulgar circus for the bloodthirsty masses. This “festival” is an insult to our cultural heritage."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"What did we find out, then?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Hmmm, sounds to me like the festival is a recent phenomenon...which means it's almost certainly an imitation of our Masked Carnivale."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"If we're to be completely sure, though, I need to see one of these matches with my own eyes."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Now, I heard the same thing as you did about buying tickets: seems they all sell out before you can bloody blink. But rumor has it they do a thrivin' trade on the black market."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"And as much as I'd prefer to avoid dealin' with back-alley types, I don't think we have time to mess about. Let's wander the streets around Kogane Dori, and see what's on offer, shall we?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Keep an eye out for any shady-lookin' characters..."},{"name":"GYODO","text":"(-???-)Festival tickets!

Where are my <span class=\"emphasis\">clothes</span>, you nasty little bottom-feeder!"},{"name":"GYODO","text":"N-Now, now, let us not be hasty! Your money I can return, but the fine clothing sold quickly! Perhaps you will accept some other form of recompense, yes, yes?"},{"name":"GYODO","text":"...Tickets!

Then I must be on my way!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Well, I s'pose I'll never see my clothin' again...but at least I got some coins back, and snagged an entry ticket into the bargain."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Let's head on over to the castle, and see if there's any matches underway. I imagine there's someone collectin' tickets at the gate."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"This ought to be interestin'..."},{"name":"KUGANESTAFF","text":"Oh, are you in for a treat─the inimitable “Golden Goliath” is on the docket for today's entertainment! May I see your tickets, please?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Will this get the both of us in?"},{"name":"KUGANESTAFF","text":"Certainly, sir... You are aware, however, that this token only permits entry to the preliminary matches? A full-price ticket is required to view the main event."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Grrr, that slimy, bewhiskered bugger must've slipped us the cheapest one he had! Well, never mind. As long as we can get some idea of what's going on in this festival of theirs..."},{"name":"KUGANEMC","text":"Ladies and gentlemen! Here to raise the curtain on this evening's spectacle of savagery is the illustrious sky-wrapped warrior himself...Bluehood!"},{"name":"KUGANEMC","text":"Be amazed by his cerulean arts as he tangles with a terrible and tenacious Yanxian tiger!"},{"name":"KUGANEMC","text":"A masterful performance! While few compare to the magnificence of Golden Goliath, who can deny the talent apparent in Bluehood─the original pioneer of blue wizardry!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"The pioneer of─ It was <span class=\"emphasis\">me</span> who brought blue magic to the masses, not this puffed-up pretender!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I've seen enough. The spells are real, alright, but the execution is atrocious. It's an offense against our profession!

Before we progress to the main event, Bluehood himself has asked that you spare him a moment of your attention."},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"(-Bluehood-)Listen one, listen all! No occult tricks or arcane incantations can contend with the all-surpassing might of blue wizardry! Who among you dreams of holding such miraculous power in the palm of his or her hand!?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I know that voice! It's him─it's bloody Nutiba Buntiba!"},{"name":"SPECTATORMAN03990","text":"Are you saying that <span class=\"emphasis\">anyone</span> can learn those spells? Even me...?"},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"(-Bluehood-)If you but possess the will, then I, the founder of azure evocations, need only to mark the way!"},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"(-Bluehood-)I have with me a surfeit of talismans to awaken the blue spirit within you, and a stack of custom-made raiments to arm and garb you!"},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"(-Bluehood-)Those first in line will also receive one of a limited number of blue wizardry spell tomes! Come forth, and open your purses! The bold will be rewarded!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"That thievin' bastard! I <span class=\"emphasis\">knew</span> I was missing a cache of soul crystals..."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I mean, has he no shame!? He's even stolen my old sales pitch, right down to the introductory offer!"},{"name":"KUGANEMC","text":"Ladies and gentlemen! I must ask those without full-price admission tickets to kindly vacate the seats. The main event is soon to commence!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I wasn't entirely sure what we'd find in there, but it wasn't the great vanishin' Nutiba, I can tell you that much."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Let's wait around for a bit and see if he comes out. I think I'd like to have a few words with our buddin' entrepreneur."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Well, well, fancy meetin' you here, Nutiba! Hope you've got a good explanation for why you'd stab your old guildmaster in the back like this!"},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"(-Bluehood-)S-Sorry? You must have mistaken me for someone else. I haven't the faintest idea wh─"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"You can drop the act already! I saw you flauntin' your “blue wizardry” in that farce of a performance. And don't think I didn't recognize my missin' soul crystals!"},{"name":"KAGEYAMA","text":"Now see here! I don't know who you are or what you want, but I'll not have you endangering my investment! Have a care with whom you meddle!"},{"name":"KAGEYAMA","text":"Hah! Strangers in this land, are you? Then you would do well to learn the name of Kageyama, merchant prince of Kugane!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Merchant...prince?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"So he's just some two-gil villain, is he? Must have some stones on him if he thought he could conquer the castle, though."},{"name":"KAGEYAMA","text":"Ah! I recognize you now! That was a misunderstanding! I was a victim of circumstance! I've since put that all behind me and resumed my place as an upstanding citizen and businessman."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Coercion? Kidnapping? Sounds like a right proper piece of work."},{"name":"KAGEYAMA","text":"Ah! I recognize you now! That wasn't my idea! I was as much a victim of that awful man as anyone! In any case, I've since put all that behind me and resumed my place as an upstanding citizen and businessman."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Well, whatever you claim to be, it's clear that your enterprise is a blatant imitation of our Masked Carnivale in Ul'dah. As guildmaster of the blue mages, I demand you cease and desist in this unscrupulous attempt to profit from the spellcraft that <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> established."},{"name":"KAGEYAMA","text":"Do you expect me to simply crumble before your insistence?

You find these terms acceptable, I trust?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"O-Of course! Consider your challenge accepted!"},{"name":"KAGEYAMA","text":"Hm hm hm, very good.

Don't stray too far, now..."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"...Gods above, what've I got myself into this time? Come on, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I need to run back to the teahouse. My shift is about to start."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Right. All I have to do is beat this Golden Goliath fellow, and the festival is history. I mean, how difficult could it be? Even if he is their “champion,” the whole thing is an inferior contest in the first place."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"But even though I'm sure to win, it never pays to be overconfident. Best do some more investigatin' before the match, I'm thinkin'."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"By the way, you might want to keep yourself up to snuff on the off chance I'm unfit for battle on the day.
