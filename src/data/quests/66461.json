That they gave you a memorable challenge, one that you would proudly share with comrades over a tankard of ale. But Eorzea is no faerie-tale world, and life is not a song. Sometimes you slay a primal, sometimes not. But perhaps Ser Clotairion will have a greater appreciation for your accomplishments.","Ser Clotairion is grateful for your service, though he realizes full well that your intent was only to ingratiate yourself with him. Nevertheless, he promises that Lord Drillemont will know of your deeds."],"objectives":["<span class=\"highlight-yellow\">* This quest has been adjusted.
