For you, I imagine it would be like crushing ants underfoot."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"That is why I would ask you to give my men a brief lesson in combat by slaying the antlions at Pike Falls. I've instructed them to stay well out of sight, so you should have no trouble fighting without distraction. When you've finished, any advice you can offer them would no doubt be invaluable to their training."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"They've been instructed to watch you closely, albeit from a safe distance.

I can't promise your words will remain with me in the heat of battle, but I will do my best not to disappoint you or my superiors."},{"name":"SOLDIERMAN02659","text":"I...I see...
