However, the analas go to great lengths to hunt us down. Their ferocity is known throughout the Ruby Sea."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"It is to you we must turn. Venture into their territory, slay any that confront you. A show of force should send the rest slinking back to their dens."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"You are looking rather singed around the edges! Did the analas prove troublesome?"},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"Glad tidings indeed. By your account, we have the shores of Hells' Lid to ourselves again. The area is safe for harvesting shellfish, for the time being at least."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"Not only are they good for eating, but they are also used in the production of mother of pearl-inlaid pots.

I do know, however, that the analas will not be content to remain in their lairs like the Namazu in their pots. Should they emerge once more, we may require your aid."}],"reward":{"gil":550,"reputation":60,"items":[{"num":15,"id":28},{"id":21081}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":4,"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":34}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1024217","obj":{"i":1024217,"n":"Zukin","l":2409,"q":24}},{"type":"item","id":"28","obj":{"i":28,"n":"Allagan Tomestone of Poetics","l":1,"c":65023,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"21081","obj":{"i":21081,"n":"Kojin Sango","l":1,"c":65058,"t":100}}]}
