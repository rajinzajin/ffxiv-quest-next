He is particularly interested to know how well the spells he has mastered will keep a party of blue mages fighting fit while exploring dangerous locations, such as Copperbell Mines, which he plans to visit. A recent increase in hecatoncheir activity has made the mineral excavation site too hazardous for the workers to enter, and Martyn aims to quell the uprising, test his theories, and train P'yandih and Nutiba Buntiba, all in one fell swoop. His two young apprentices have been told to wait for you in the nearby settlement of Horizon, with the mines a short distance away.","In Horizon, P'yandih explains that she has already visited Copperbell Mines on several occasions. Nutiba Buntiba, on the other hand, lacks her experience, but has made efforts to study the layout of the tunnels. Martyn, meanwhile, has next to no knowledge of the mines, having never been there himself and neglecting to gather any information beforehand. However, Nutiba's motto of “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail,” seems to have struck a chord with him. Martyn leads the party across the plains of western Thanalan to the site of the proposed hecatoncheir hunt.","To the surprise of all, the first opponent to greet the party is not a hecatoncheir, but a winged voidsent. Martyn and his two students have already slain the beast by the time you arrive, and since you were too late to join the battle, you are nominated to search the area for a similar creature that has escaped them and poses a threat to the people of Horizon.","You soon discover the voidsent hovering ominously a short distance from the mine, and despite its determination to rip you into bite-sized meaty chunks, it finally succumbs to your blue magic. You return to report the outcome of your battle to Martyn and the others, who are still attempting to unravel the mystery of what exactly has occurred here.","Martyn comes to the realization that the voidsent are identical to those used in the Masked Carnivale, and the question as to how this could have happened is soon answered when Fyrgeiss and his son Zirnberk burst forth from the mine. They had released voidsent into the tunnels as a means of eradicating the hecatoncheires that had invaded Copperbell Mines, a task which would normally fall to the Stone Torches. Having learned of Fyrgeiss's whereabouts from his underlings, Royse arrives on the scene to berate him for taking the voidsent from the Celestium's menagerie. He responds by claiming that his recent investment gives him the right to use the creatures as he pleases. Royse emphasizes that in spite of the financial backing she has received, her position remains unchanged, sparking a vitriolic exchange between her and Fyrgeiss. Martyn interjects to suggest that rather than using voidsent, Amajina & Sons could instead hire the Blue Mages' Guild to protect their property. When this proposal is cruelly thrown back in his face, he quickly changes tack by offering a wager based on the outcome of his match with Zirnberk. In the event that he loses, control of the Celestium would pass to Fyrgeiss, and the use of voidsent as living weapons would be allowed to continue. Should Martyn win the contest, Royse would remain as owner and the Blue Mages' Guild would enter the employ of Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern. Though Royse is aghast at the idea of placing her livelihood in Martyn's less-than-reliable hands, Fyrgeiss willingly accepts, assured that his son will emerge the victor. Having said more than enough for one day, your mentor decides against making the situation any worse than it already is by retiring to Ul'dah to prepare for his highly anticipated battle.","Back at the Blue Mages' Guild, Martyn's bravado does little to set Royse's mind at ease, and it seems that she is all but resigned to losing the Celestium. Martyn's preparations for the fight seem to extend only to asking that you be ready to stand in for him, in the not-as-unlikely-as-one-might-think event that he would be prevented from participating. Being in the habit of asking you to learn specific blue magic spells, he instructs you to master Frog Legs. Strangely enough, this is a technique for drawing the enemy's attention, which is seldom an issue in the arena, though as Martyn points out, the day may soon arrive that you have a chance to use it, should the guild ever enter the employ of Amajina & Sons.<br><br>※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon reaching level 60 and learning Frog Legs."],"objectives":["Speak with Martyn in Horizon.","Speak with Martyn.","Survey the designated location and defeat any voidsent that appear.","Speak with Martyn.","Speak with Martyn in Ul'dah."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you can hardly be considered my equal if you haven't even learned Exuviation yet!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon learning Exuviation."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"You might be wonderin' why I'd ask you to learn Exuviation of all things."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Well, it's all part of my research into the versatility of blue mages. You can use it to heal yourself, of course, but I want to see how effective that spell is in keepin' your friends alive and kickin'."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"In fact, I thought we'd take P'yandih and Nutiba out into the field to test a few of my theories. It'll be good trainin' for them, too. I've sent them ahead to Horizon, and from there we'll head to Copperbell Mines, where I hear hecatoncheires are causin' a spot of bother."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"An ongoin' problem, by all accounts. Sounds like the perfect chance to show off our teamwork. Not that we've ever worked as a team before, but this seems a good place to start!"},{"name":"LATOOLJA","text":"Latool Ja not sure about this plan. Nutiba and P'yandih probably think this just a training exercise, but hecatoncheires very dangerous!"},{"name":"LATOOLJA","text":"Please, try to keep all three from harm. Maybe <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> act as healer, yes?"},{"name":"LATOOLJA","text":"Martyn very irresponsible to take new recruits into hecatoncheir-infested mines.

Ahem."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Oh, look who it is! Finished sightseein', have we?"},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"Master <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Since last we met, my blue magic has come on leaps and bounds!"},{"name":"PYANDIH","text":"And thanks to our last lesson, I'm better at keeping my enemies on the back foot! Or tentacle. Well, whatever it might be."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Oi! Don't go gettin' ahead of yourselves. You might have a few new spells and a bit more experience, but if you get complacent, those hecatoncheires'll be grindin' your bones before you can say “Flying Sardine”!"},{"name":"PYANDIH","text":"Hmph! I'm no stranger to Copperbell Mines, you know. Hecatoncheires don't scare me!"},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"As this is my first time exploring this particular location, I have been asking other adventurers for advice, checking the layout of the tunnels and so forth. “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail,” is my motto!

Ha ha! Only joking! We all know who the leader is. Blue mages, with me!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"You're pullin' my leg, ain't you? So, the only one who knows nothin' about the place...is me? Hmph! I've never been the sort to let a complete lack of prior knowledge stop me from doin' anythin' before, and I ain't about to start now. Blue mages, with me!"},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"I wasn't expecting to be attacked before even setting foot in the mine, let alone by a...voidsent? I assume that's what it is. Was, rather."},{"name":"PYANDIH","text":"I don't know what it is, but I'm glad it's dead. Wait. Did it just twitch, or am I imagining things?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"We were waitin' for you to show up when this bloody horrible flyin' bastard came out of nowhere! Even though it caught us off guard, it was no match for the combined might of our blue magic!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"There was another one that went flappin' off somewhere, but we're too knackered to go after it. Seein' as you missed all the fun, I'm volunteerin' you to go and look for it. And be quick about it! All hells'll break loose if that thing reaches Horizon."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I need you to track down and kill that voidsent before it gets away!"},{"name":"NUTIBABUNTIBA","text":"Voidsent don't simply appear out of thin air. Someone or <span class=\"emphasis\">something</span> must be behind this..."},{"name":"PYANDIH","text":"It took all three of us to kill the first voidsent, and then you show up and take down one by yourself! Seems like we've got a lot to learn, including the guildmaster..."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Nicely done, mate. Now that I think of it, I've seen creatures like this before. They're used in the Masked Carnivale!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Which raises the question: what are they doin' here?"},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"(-???-)They went this way! Quickly!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Fyrgeiss! And his son, Zirnfrieg...or was that Siegberk? Bah, whatever his bloody name is!"},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"Azuro? You and your little friends managed to slay the escaped voidsent? It seems you have spared our blushes."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Sod all that, just tell us what's goin' on!"},{"name":"ROYSE","text":"(-???-)You heard him, Fyrgeiss!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Royse as well? Bloody hells, they're all comin' out of the woodwork now."},{"name":"ROYSE","text":"I'm lucky your underlings are so loose-lipped, or I would never have tracked you down. You think you can make off with my voidsent and get away with it!? Investor or not, you've crossed the line."},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"Now, now. I simply borrowed a couple in an attempt to quell the hecatoncheir uprising taking place on Concern property."},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"I am sure you will be pleased to hear that your vodorigas proved to be most effective! Veritable living weapons! You see, the task seemed a waste of the Stone Torches' talents, and hiring adventurers can be awfully costly."},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"As a matter of fact, I am considering deploying voidsent elsewhere to protect my interests from roaming beasts, Amalj'aa marauders, and the like, leaving my son and his men free to return to Ul'dah, where their talents could be put to better use."},{"name":"ROYSE","text":"So that's what this is all about. It was just a ploy to get your hands on my pit fiends, wasn't it? This is a breach of our agreement!"},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"Breach? With the vast amount I have invested into it, the Celestium is as good as mine."},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"I have the right to run it in any way I please.

The Celestium is mine, you hear me!?"},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"Watch your mouth, you second-rate hack!"},{"name":"ROYSE","text":"Oh, is that so? Maybe I should ask your friends at the Syndicate who <span class=\"emphasis\">they</span> think is second-rate?"},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"I'll drive you out of Ul'dah─nay, Eorzea! Everything you own will be mine! Mine!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Might I make a suggestion? If you're looking for a substitute for the Stone Torches, perhaps the Blue Mages' Guild is a more...manageable alternative to rampaging beasts."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Each of our mages comes fully equipped with a comprehensive selection of offensive, defensive, and healing spells, perfect for every occasion."},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"Every occasion? Come now, we all know that he who embraces too much has a weak grasp. I have no need of pathetic jesters in silly costumes."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Oi, watch it, grandad! We'll see who's pathetic when I put your boy on his arse!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"In fact, it seems to me that we could settle this whole dispute with a friendly wager."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"If I lose, the Celestium goes to you, includin' the whole menagerie. You can use all of those voidsent, along with the rest of the pit fiends, however you like."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"But if I win, the Celestium stays with Royse. You'll give up any thought of usin' voidsent and employ the Blue Mages' Guild to defend your property instead."},{"name":"ROYSE","text":"You bloody idiot! What do you think you're doing!?"},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"You have spirit, I'll give you that. Very well, I accept."},{"name":"ZIRNBERK","text":"I cannot decide which I am looking forward to most; adding the Celestium to my family's ever-growing collection of businesses, or utterly humiliating you in front of your beloved audience. I will see you in the arena, clown."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Now that's settled, we might as well get goin'. Thanks to the voidsent, it looks like we won't be huntin' hecatoncheires after all."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Nutiba, P'yandih, I don't think I'll be able to give any more lessons until after my match, so perhaps you should go and learn some new spells or somethin'. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and I will head back to the guild."},{"name":"FYRGEISS","text":"That blue-garbed friend of yours certainly has a big mouth when it suits him. His little outburst will cost Royse dearly, you mark my words."},{"name":"ZIRNBERK","text":"You must be Azuro the Second, yes? I daresay you are a lot more capable than that cretin you insist on following around."},{"name":"ROYSE","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; I can't believe this..."},{"name":"LATOOLJA","text":"Latool Ja hear what happened. No wonder Royse look so distraught."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Ha! Nothin' like raisin' the stakes to make a fight more interestin', wouldn't you say?"},{"name":"ROYSE","text":"As much as the very idea of it brings bile to the back of my mouth, the future of the Celestium is in your hands, Martyn. If you lose to Siegfried, I'll throw you to the behemoths!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Fear not! I, the Great Azuro, swear to defend your arena with my very life!"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Like I have a bloody choice... This is another fine mess I've talked myself into. Anyway, like I said before, I'll need you to be ready to stand in for me, on the off chance I eat some dodgy dragon peppers or somethin' and am “unavoidably detained,” if you catch my meanin'."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Oh, and there's one more spell I want you to learn. It's called Frog Legs, and while it might not be all that useful in the arena, you'll be able to put it to use once we're gettin' paid to protect Amajina & Sons' mines."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"As Azuro the Second, I'm expectin' great things from you.
