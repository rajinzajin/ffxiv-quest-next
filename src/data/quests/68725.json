See if there is aught you can do to put his mind at ease.","A timely Echo-induced flashback gives you insight into Ramza Beoulve's final confrontation with Ultima, the High Seraph, and how Orran Durai and King Delita Heiral worked to see their companion's legacy both erased and preserved. The only path left for you...and all of Hydaelyn is to confront the Angel of Blood once more beneath the Orbonne Monastery.<br><br>※The Orbonne Monastery can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","Ultima is defeated and the land rid of her foul presence once and for all. Ramza, however, has yet to regain consciousness. All you can do now is wait.","Aetherial visions of the hero Ramza Beoulve and King Delita appear to grant you and the Lexentales their thanks before returning once and for all to the Lifestream.","Jenomis, despite having fulfilled his lifelong desire to discover the truth behind Ivalice and his ancestor Orran Durai, has second thoughts about revealing his discovery to the world. He instead elects to tell the tale in an all-new final act of his renowned play, <span class=\"emphasis\">The Zodiac Brave Story</span>. After witnessing the Majestic Theater Company rehearse this heartwarming scene, both you and Lina Mewrilah are at a loss for words...or at least you are.","Lina Mewrilah is thoroughly satisfied with the outcome of events, and decides she will remain in Kugane for as long as her employers at <span class=\"emphasis\">The Raven</span> will foot the bill.

Children, elderly, the wounded─I have been assured that all are welcome."},{"name":"FRAN","text":"Unlike our demand for soldiery, both Lady Tataru and Lady Yugiri seemed much more amicable to this request.
