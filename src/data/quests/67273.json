Mere moments ago I was mobbed by a huge swarm of frost grenades. I made away with my life, but dropped my magic talisman in the confusion. It was a gift from my family, but the instant those monsters saw it, they lost all interest in meâ”€they tore the thing apart and fled with the pieces!"},{"name":"SOLDIER01737","text":"That talisman carries a lot of sentimental value for me. I have to get it back, but I can't leave my post. Hmmm...you strike me as quite the capable sort.

Still, it carries no small amount of sentimental value for me."},{"name":"SOLDIER01737","text":"I wonder what made the frost grenades swarm over it so. Did they plan to <span class=\"emphasis\">eat</span> it? For something that's supposed to protect me, this talisman is doing a dreadful job."},{"name":"SOLDIER01737","text":"Whatever the reason, I'd much prefer not getting attacked again. I'll be sure to put this somewhere safe in the barracks rather than carrying it on my person.
