To wit, she would ask you to make haste to the Greatloam Growery and do what you can to procure eggs from Master Pawlin's flock of fine chickens─a task which has proved an unexpected challenge thus far. You set out for the farm in hopes of seeking out one Nonotta─a friend of Jihli's who will provide further enlightenment as to the task required of you.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","At the Greatloam Growery, a crestfallen Nonotta informs you that Master Pawlin's flock of fine birds has fled the farm along with the so-called “happy bunnies”─rabbit-like creatures of legend said to bring all who encounter them good fortune. At Jihli's dear friend's behest, you agree to search for the creatures, in the hopes that this year's Hatching–tide festivities might resemble those foretold.","Following the trail of your quarry, you learn that the rabbits and chickens ran off in the direction of New Gridania. You resolve to head there and see if there are any leads to be had.","Try as you might to track down the fugitive rabbits and chickens, they as yet elude your grasp─having fled this time out of the city and into the forest. Make for the Central Shroud and hunt down these rogue birds and bunnies, that the Hatching–tide festivities may yet be saved.","Putting your keen hunting skills to good use, you manage to round up the entire menagerie of runaway critters. With a sigh of relief, you resolve to make for the city and report to Jihli Aliapoh, who will no doubt be tickled pink to hear of your success.","Back in town, Jihli offers her profuse thanks for your efforts, further explaining that the chickens have settled down and appear ready and willing to offer their eggs to you in abundance. Hatching–tide can now go off without a hitch! Nonotta offers to finish decorating the eggs so that you and your newfound friends may take to the streets and distribute them just as Jihli envisioned in her dreams─and with any luck, bring good fortune to one and all in the process.","With assistance from newfound friends both feathered and floppy-eared, you have completed the task of handing out decorative eggs to a host of appreciative Gridanians. And isn't that what Hatching–tide is all about? Probably! Jihli Aliapoh will no doubt be overjoyed to hear of your contributions toward seeing that this year's Hatching–tide is another resounding success.","Jihli Aliapoh rejoices at your return, offering her profuse gratitude for your efforts in saving this year's Hatching–tide from the brink of disaster. Relieved that her dreams have once again brought smiles and joy to the denizens of Gridania, she presents you with a charming mammet fashioned to resemble the auspicious rabbits which you have grown to know and have mixed feelings about. You are now free to enjoy the Hatching–tide festivities to your heart's content, or continue to assist the Dreamers in giving the gift of eggs should you so desire."],"objectives":["Speak with Nonotta.","Search for witnesses near the Greatloam Growery.","Search for witnesses in New Gridania.","Complete the FATE “Happiness Is a Warm Bunny” in the Central Shroud.","Speak with Jihli Aliapoh.","Speak with Nonotta.","Speak with Jihli Aliapoh."],"dialogue":[{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"A happy Hatching–tide to you, friend!

If it isn't <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! What a pleasure to see you!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Ah, but where are my manners? My name is Jihli Aliapoh, and I oversee the centerpiece of the celebration─the gloriously eggstravagant egg hunt!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"You are an adventurer, are you not? If it wouldn't be too bold of me, might I ask your name?"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─what a lovely and festive ring that has to it! But where was I? Ah, yes─the egg hunt! The tradition began several years ago, after I was blessed with a vision by the Twelve Archons of ages past."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"As it happens, I was visited by a most curious dream again this year. In it, brave adventurers─not unlike yourself─were going about town, handing out decorative eggs in the company of, er...chickens and odd-looking rabbits."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Truth be told, I have struggled to grasp its true meaning. Still, if the past is any guide, the best way to get to the bottom of this is for us to recreate the image from my dream and see what good fortune it may bring!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"To that end, I've invited Master Pawlin─Limsa Lominsa's preeminent chicken farmer─and his flock here to Gridania, and furthermore placed an order for a full fluffle of rabbit-esque mammets resembling the ones from my dream."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"We have, however, hit a bit of a snag. It would appear the hens have not yet gotten acclimated to their new environment, and they've been raising quite the ruckus─making it nigh impossible to retrieve the eggs they've laid. Might you be willing to lend a hand?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"That sounds eggciting!"},{"name":"A1","text":"What's in it for me?"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Now that's a <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> after my own heart!

That one perhaps needs some work."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"In any case, Master Pawlin's chickens are being cooped at the Greatloam Growery─might I ask you to travel there and give them a look? My friend Nonotta works there as well, so I would be most grateful if you could also ensure that she's not...overly harried."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Do pass along my regards to Nonotta at the Greatloam Growery, yes?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Hm? Oh! I...&lt;wheeze&gt;...remember you. Pray forgive me─I'm feeling terribly <span class=\"emphasis\">egg</span>shausted at the moment."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Is there something you need?

In that case, allow me to explain."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"While it's true that we've been having trouble rounding up all the eggs, we also face a more pressing concern─the growery has been invaded by bizarre fluffy creatures!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"What's more, they're not content just to run around and make mischief. Why, they're tormenting the chickens and trying to steal the eggs for themselves!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Needless to say, that has only driven the chickens into even more of a tizzy. It's been a veritable battlefield! Master Pawlin is doing all he can to keep the creatures contained, but even he seems just about at wit's end..."},{"name":"PAWLIN","text":"(-Pained Scream-)Uwaaaaaaaaahhh!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"M-Master Pawlin! Has our last line of defense been breached!? Oh, the poor man..."},{"name":"2022ESTCHICKEN","text":"(-Feral Chicken-)Cluck!

Our fearsome invaders from the gods know where!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Good heavens─they both look as if they're out for blood! Whatever are we to do!?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Let me try to calm them down."},{"name":"A2","text":"Don't look at me!"},{"name":"A2","text":"I think we can solve this by force."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Such bravery! ...Not that I expected any less from you. In that case, good luck out there! And remember─close observation of both parties is the key to a successful mediation."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Well, let's see. Perhaps you could attempt to soothe them? Cluck gently, or some such? Yes, do give it a go. And remember─close observation of both parties is the key to a successful mediation."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"F-Force!? And here I thought these little critters were savage. Are you perhaps the most savage of them all?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Anyhow, before we resort to violence, perhaps you could attempt to soothe them? Cluck gently, or some such? Yes, do give it a go. And remember─close observation of both parties is the key to a successful mediation."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Drawing upon your extensive experience in confronting myriad savage beasts, you gaze upon the two bloodthirsty creatures intently, taking in their every move and facial expression..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The chicken and the bunny stand at odds, neither willing to give an ilm in their grudge match...or so you assess the situation."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"How fascinating... The chicken is understandably on its guard, fearing that the rabbit is targeting its eggs. But could it be that the bunny, too, harbors some resentment of its own?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Now that I think about it, this creature bears a most uncanny resemblance to the rabbits Jihli described from her dream."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"I did some research of my own before you arrived─according to the tomes, it is so rare a creature that many consider it simply a myth. Have you by any chance encountered anything similar during your travels?"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Now that you mention it..."},{"name":"A3","text":"Never seen anything like it."},{"name":"A3","text":"Yes...on the Isle of Val!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"You don't say!? I would have expected nothing less of a well-traveled adventurer such as yourself. No doubt you are already aware, but these most unique creatures are known in certain parts as...“happy bunnies.” There is something about their long ears, fluffy tails, and hippity-hoppity manner that brings a smile to one's face, yes?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"I see... Hardly a surprise, that─after all, very few have ever actually seen one in the flesh. Oh, incidentally, these most unique creatures are known in certain parts as...“happy bunnies.” There is something about their long ears, fluffy tails, and hippity-hoppity manner that brings a smile to one's face, yes?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Yes, precisely! That is exactly where my resources say they were once spotted! As you are doubtless already aware, these most unique creatures are known up north as “happy bunnies.” Something about their long ears, fluffy tails, and hippity-hoppity manner brings a smile to one's face..."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Why, legend has it that simply encountering one is a sure sign that good fortune is headed your way. While they are not <span class=\"emphasis\">precisely</span> the same creature, perhaps our most unique guests will also have a similarly auspicious effect on us?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"You, there! Mister Bunny! If you are truly as happy at heart as your compatriots of legend, might you not make peace with these fine chickens, and cooperate with us to make this year's festivities an <span class=\"emphasis\">egg</span>stravaganza of merriment and good cheer?"},{"name":"2022ESTUSAGI","text":"&lt;squeak&gt; &lt;squeak&gt;"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Oh..."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"B-But this won't do! Why, our harbinger of happiness is fleeing from our very grasp─and our last chicken is running off with it! Something must be done!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"If Jihli's dreams are to be trusted─and I've never known them to be anything but─those bunnies and their unique power are the key to making this year's Hatching–tide festivities a rousing success!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"I beg of you, friend─follow those creatures! They may lead you to their fellow escapees. I'll do the same just as soon as I see to Master Pawlin's wounds."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"I wasn't able to make out where they were headed, but no doubt there was an eyewitness or two nearby. Pray gather what information you can, and round up the little critters as best as you are able. We can rendezvous back in town with Jihli."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Were you able to find anyone who witnessed our bunnies' escape? I fear that Master Pawlin's wounds still demand my attention, so I'm counting on you to round them all up!"},{"name":"PAWLIN","text":"I did my best to calm them as their talons raged and rent my silks to shreds... Alas, it was to no avail."},{"name":"PAWLIN","text":"Whatever could have gotten into my dear hens to send them into such a fluster? Why, I simply must go after─ow, that stings!"},{"name":"2022ESTMOB4","text":"Well, that was a sight if I've ever seen one. Bizarre-looking bunnies and chickens racing by me as if possessed..."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB4","text":"They were headed over that way─toward New Gridania. I can only hope they don't cause too much of a stir in town..."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB4","text":"Well, that was a sight if I've ever seen one.

I can only hope they don't cause too much of a stir in town..."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB1","text":"Chickens and rabbits? They were headed for the aetheryte plaza. Go after them if you like─the Adders don't pay nearly enough for me to get mixed up in all this."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB1","text":"But that chicken...why, I've never seen such a fierce-looking bird."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB2","text":"Chickens and rabbits? Oh, I saw a whole army of them running off to the Carline Canopy!"},{"name":"2022ESTMOB2","text":"A whole army of strange rabbit-things and clucking chickens ran off toward the Carline Canopy! And there was a person in an odd costume running after them... Hatching–tide gets curiouser and curiouser every year!"},{"name":"2022ESTMOB3","text":"&lt;huff&gt; &lt;huff&gt; How do they get around so fast on those tiny legs? I'm not cut out for this..."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB3","text":"What's that? They're <span class=\"emphasis\">where</span> now!? Good gods. ...Understood. I'll enlist the services of an able adventurer right away."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB3","text":"Matron's teats! Don't sneak up on me like─ Wait a moment. Are you, perchance, an adventurer!?"},{"name":"2022ESTMOB3","text":"Nonotta sent you in search of the bunnies, you say? How fortuitous! That linkpearl call just now was from her─and she's tasked me with doing the very same."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB3","text":"...Just between you and me, however, I've yet to catch a single one. As I was running after them, their friends started showing up one after the next, and before I knew it, a veritable legion of them had hippity-hopped their way into the Twelveswood."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB3","text":"I fear there's far too many of them for the two of us to handle alone. I'll go and call for reinforcements─could I trouble you to go on ahead to the Mirror Planks? According to Nonotta, that's where they were last sighted."},{"name":"2022ESTMOB3","text":"In the meantime, I will do my best to rally others to our cause. Now, go quickly, friend─the fate of this year's Hatching–tide hangs in the balance!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The FATE “Happiness Is a Warm Bunny” can only be completed as a Disciple of War or Magic."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Say no more─I've heard everything. My sincere apologies for all the trouble we had to put you through, but let it suffice to say your efforts have all but saved this year's Hatching–tide from disaster!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Some stragglers are still running about, but we've captured the better part of both flocks. Nonotta, Master Pawlin, and my colleagues should be able to round up the rest in due time."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"But there's even more good news! It seems the exercise went a long way to soothe our savage chickens, and we've retrieved eggs in abundance to decorate!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Ah, Nonotta! Master Pawlin! Allow me to thank you for your efforts, as well. I was just sharing the happy tidings with <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> here."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Wait...is this perchance one of the “happy bunnies” that were the source of this whole hullabaloo? Why, they truly are the spitting image of the little critters that came to me in my vision!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Seeing how calm and well-behaved it is now, I can scarcely believe it gave you such trouble! Your other chickens are resting easy now, I gather?"},{"name":"PAWLIN","text":"No worries there, Jihli, my dear! My birds have spent up all their nervous energy, and are as relaxed now as I've ever seen them. Why, after their little spat, it even seems that they've come to a mutual understanding with their fluffy new friends."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"I'm happy to say that the rabbits, too, are now obeying our attendants with scarcely a peep of argument. And─wouldn't you know it─just before, one of them handed us this crystal!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Could it be...!? Why, they truly are harbingers of happiness and good fortune!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"I have a good feeling about this, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Do come back later so I can fill you in on the details, yes? Needless to say, I'll also have a special something for you as a token of thanks for your services. As for now, I must prepare for the festivities..."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"In the meantime, could I trouble you to lead these little fellows through the streets and join them in handing out eggs to the townspeople? If my dreams are any guide, I'm sure it will bring no end of smiles to one and all!"},{"name":"2022ESTCHICKEN","text":"Cluck cluck!

That's what I like to see!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"And with that, I'd best be putting the final decorative touches on these eggs! Whenever you're ready, just say the word!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Curious as to just what sort of good fortune the bunnies have brought us? Tee hee...I knew you would be! And when we're both done with our duties, I'd be more than happy to tell you! In the meantime, good luck handing out those eggs!"},{"name":"PAWLIN","text":"If you hadn't taken care of the rabbits for us, I daresay it would have been all but impossible to round up my flock. Truly, I can't thank you enough!"},{"name":"2022ESTUSAGI","text":"&lt;squeak&gt; &lt;squeak&gt;"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The happy bunny seems most proud of itself. It looks at you with eyes that seem to say, “Handing out eggs? I was born for this!”"},{"name":"2022ESTCHICKEN","text":"Cluck...cluck!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The chicken looks at you with a warm, gentle gaze─as if to say that it is more than happy to entrust the precious eggs laid by its flock to you and your friends."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Ready to start handing out some eggs? Lovely! In that case, here you go─pray take our little friends along and spread happiness the whole city over!"},{"name":"Q4","text":"Where will you hand out eggs?"},{"name":"A4","text":"By the markets."},{"name":"A4","text":"By the Botanists' Guild."},{"name":"A4","text":"By Nophica's Altar."},{"name":"NICOLIAUX","text":"A decorated egg? For me? How thoughtful!"},{"name":"NICOLIAUX","text":"There's even a treat inside! Thank you ever so much."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Your efforts are sincerely appreciated. These seasonal celebrations bring so much joy to the children─and myself, I confess."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Still, I must say...it's been years since I've seen a traveler rabbit in the flesh. I never would have expected to encounter one here."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"What's that? That nomenclature is unfamiliar to you? Ah, in the North they are known more...colloquially...as “happy bunnies,” are they not? They're said to usher in smiles and good fortune..."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Before that─yes, since much older times─they were known as “traveler rabbits.” They have a habit of showing up at your side unannounced, then vanishing off somewhere before you know it. I recall seeing one in the Twelveswood when I was but a child."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Ah, but forgive me... You have other places you must be. We can talk another time─pray relax and enjoy the festivities when your work is done."},{"name":"FORESTLOVINGRABBIT","text":"Why, I daresay the wood used to fashion those decorations was among the finest I've ever laid eyes on. As always, your eye for quality timber is simply unparalleled."},{"name":"GRASSSTAINEDRABBIT","text":"You're far too kind, Master Bea─ I mean...my forest-loving, floppy-eared friend. Likewise, I have no doubt the wood rejoiced to find itself in the hands of one who understands it as well as you."},{"name":"GRASSSTAINEDRABBIT","text":"...Or should I say “paws”?"},{"name":"FORESTLOVINGRABBIT","text":"Ha!"},{"name":"GRASSSTAINEDRABBIT","text":"Oh! If it isn't <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! How good it is to see you well."},{"name":"GRASSSTAINEDRABBIT","text":"An adventurer? I don't believe we've met..."},{"name":"FORESTLOVINGRABBIT","text":"An egg for me? And what a charming little fellow carrying it. I accept your gift with gratitude."},{"name":"GRASSSTAINEDRABBIT","text":"How very clever you are! Though I did hear a rumor of some concern..."},{"name":"GRASSSTAINEDRABBIT","text":"Yes, a little bird told me that creatures bearing no small resemblance to you were running wild through the streets of Gridania, trampling our precious greenery..."},{"name":"FORESTLOVINGRABBIT","text":"...And nibbling at the bark of our precious trees─a <span class=\"emphasis\">most</span> disconcerting story if there is any truth to it."},{"name":"2022ESTCHICKEN","text":"C-Cluck! Cluck cluck! Cluck..."},{"name":"FORESTLOVINGRABBIT","text":"If my intuition is not mistaken, it appears the little creature is apologizing to us in its own way."},{"name":"GRASSSTAINEDRABBIT","text":"Well, as long as you've learned your lesson, I do believe we can forgive and forget."},{"name":"GRASSSTAINEDRABBIT","text":"Thank you for the thoughtful gift, and the happiest of Hatching–tides to you!"},{"name":"REFINEDRABBIT","text":"Greetings, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

How very kind of you."},{"name":"RELAXEDRABBIT","text":"And there's the most toothsome-looking little cake inside! Do stop by the Canopy when we've finished here─I've a brew that will accompany it perfectly."},{"name":"REFINEDRABBIT","text":"I should enjoy that, indeed!"},{"name":"REFINEDRABBIT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, on behalf of all Gridania, allow me to thank you and your little colleagues for making this year's Hatching–tide so memorable.

I do hope the <span class=\"emphasis\">egg</span>sperience was an enjoyable one!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Welcome back, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! How did you and your little friends fare?"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Splendid to hear! At first, I feared that my dreams might bring only chaos and confusion to the realm this year, but thanks to you, I do believe we can declare this year's egg hunt a rousing success!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Oh, but how could I forget? In recognition of your tireless efforts on our behalf, my fellow Dreamers and I have prepared a very special Hatching–tide present just for you."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Did I mention how I procured mammets from the Goldsmiths' Guild for the festivities? This is one of them. Sadly, it was completely lifeless from the moment of arrival─it seems its core had come loose and fallen out on the way here."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"But would you believe it? I slipped in that crystal the little bunny gave me, and in an instant its tail puffed up and it whirred back to life!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"I'm quite confident it will bring its caretaker nothing but good fortune and smiles galore─and I would very much like that person to be you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.
