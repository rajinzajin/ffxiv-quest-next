While he regrets the role his people played in spreading the sickness about the forest, he is heartened that the Qitari contributed to stopping the spread of the disease through the wisdom of their forefathers. But this triumph was not achieved alone, and Chaqurl would thank his friends who dwell throughout the wood for their aid and support in a time of need. You resolve to first accompany him to Fanow, where he would express his gratitude to Master Lanille and the Viis.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Master Lanille welcomes you to Fanow, and thanks you for all you have done on behalf of her friends. After sharing word on the recent goings-on in the forest, you learn that Phyna has finally resolved to depart on her journey, and together with Ciuna, you see her off with a smile. Saying farewell to the Viis, you set out for Slitherbough, where your friends Valan and Quinfort await.","Valan welcomes you to Slitherbough, and expresses his thanks to you for saving him and his fellow Night's Blessed from their pain and suffering. Though he remains skeptical of Quinfort's ramblings, it has become difficult to deny that the priest-in-training's prognostications have proved true to some extent. Chaqurl Qhotl, for his part, would convey his thanks to the great serpent, and Quinfort is more than happy to propose a suitable venue for doing so. You resolve to accompany the young Qitari to Lake Tusi Mek'ta, where he intends to pay his respects.","You accompany Chaqurl Qhotl to Fruit of the Protector, where─notwithstanding Quinfort's suggestion─the Qitari lad elects to express his gratitude to the great serpent in his own words. While there is no way to say for certain, a glimmer from the great crystal suggests that his message did not go unheard. Speak to the boy again and see if he, too, feels the same.","Standing before the glimmering Fruit of the Protector, Chaqurl Qhotl reflects on his experiences, and is filled with a newfound sense of purpose and hope. With a spring in his step, he sets off for Hopl's Stopple, where he would reunite with his father, and you resolve to accompany him there.","Back at Hopl's Stopple, both father and son reflect on the events of the day and the history they have reclaimed, and muse about the merits of continuing the excavation, as well as recording and preserving all to be passed down to posterity. Thanking you profusely, Qitarl Natl even suggests that they might carve a new stela with imagery depicting the fateful meeting between the Qitari and the ally of Ronka. Saying your farewells for the moment, you resolve to return again when your journey takes you to the Greatwood, that you might hear and learn more about the wonders of history they will doubtless continue to unearth."],"objectives":["Speak with Lanille in Fanow.","Speak with Valan in Slitherbough.","Speak with Chaqurl Qhotl near Fruit of the Protector.","Speak with Chaqurl Qhotl.","Speak with Qitarl Natl at Hopl's Stopple."],"dialogue":[{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!

We Qitari must bear the responsibility of having spread the pox to these parts of the forest. Finally, we have brought this painful chapter of our history to a close─and we could not have done so without your invaluable aid."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"At first, I feared we might damage our relations with the Night's Blessed and the Viis beyond repair. Instead, we have managed to overcome the plague together, and in doing so, the time-tested bonds between our peoples are stronger than ever before."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"I travel to Slitherbough and Fanow all the time to share tidings from the forest with my newfound friends!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"And with the guidance of the great serpent, we have reclaimed long-lost knowledge─not just of our own kind, but of great Ronka itself."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"In studying the restored stela, I have had occasion to reflect and ruminate on the history of the empire. It truly was a great civilization, controlling and exerting influence over all of ancient Norvrandt."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"The Ronkans ruled the land with an iron fist, and thought little of subjugating other peoples through force. And yet, by uniting myriad races under their banner, the empire did much to ensure peace and prosperity for its citizens."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Yet, as Ronka continued to grow, there emerged more and more those who grew dissatisfied with life under the rule of the throne."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"No doubt, that was eventually what brought about its downfall. After all, even the greatest power will not last forever─just as even the mightiest tree will one day fall."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"It was a civilization of great enlightenment, welcoming myriad peoples and uniting them under a single banner to live in peace and prosperity."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Hume and Viis, Qitari and Ronso─living side by side and working towards a common good, the artistic and academic accomplishments of the empire were many. And yet this─its greatest strength─would also prove its downfall...or so my theory holds."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"As the empire expanded and the years went on, once-strong friendships and alliances began to turn sour. Small disagreements flared into all-out conflicts, and Ronka, once akin to a mighty tree that seemed as if it would stand forever, began to splinter from within..."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"I imagine Ronka in its final years, withered and dying. No doubt the emperor sat on his throne, waiting in vain for the arrival of one who would restore his empire to its former glory. Waiting for the ally of Ronka..."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Compared to the long and storied history of Ronka, my own three years seem as in-<span class=\"emphasis\">fig</span>-nificant as a drop of water in a great and gushing river."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"I understand the sentiment, my boy, but it is not so."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"While the lifespan of any one Qitari may be short, we must never underestimate the value of our shared knowledge and wisdom, accumulated through our many experiences and recorded for the sake of posterity."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Just as our forefathers did their part to shape the course of Ronkan history, so, too, will the discoveries you have made serve to forge the future of our people─and the Greatwood itself."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"But we must not forget our friends and allies, without whose aid we may not have survived to see this day. Might I trust you to convey our gratitude to them on my behalf, Chaqurl?"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"But of course, Father! Consider our <span class=\"emphasis\">glad</span>─no, <span class=\"emphasis\">grat</span>itude conveyed!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Hoho! Ever learning, I see. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, might I trust you to escort my son to Fanow? I would not be able to forgive myself if anything unfortunate happened to him on this day of triumph."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Come, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Master Lanille will be overjoyed to see us, I'm sure!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"And to think the Viis all but scared my whiskers off when we first met! I must say, I'm happy to call them friends today."},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"The Qitari excavation was a success, and the sickness that plagued the forest has all but subsided? These are good tidings indeed. So why is it that I cannot help but feel a bit...sad?"},{"name":"CIUNA","text":"What I would not give to see the stelae with my own eyes! Sadly, at the moment, my duties keep me here."},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"It pleases me to hear that all is well at the Stopple. We are honored to have done our small part to be of service to our Qitari friends. Never did I think I would live to see this age-old alliance of Ronka rekindled."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"For us as well, Master Lanille! From ancient rituals to the remedies that eased our pain in trying times, there is so much wisdom that we learned from you. I am certain that this is only the start of a long and fruitful friendship!"},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"You are wise beyond your years, my young friend, and there is much that you and your people have already taught us."},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"Promise that you will continue to share with us your gleanings from history, that we might put them to use ourselves in protecting and preserving our forest home."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"It would be an honor!"},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"All's well that ends well, yes? And now, I do believe the time has finally come that I stop tarrying and take to the road."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Are you going somewhere, my good madam Phyna?"},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"I will depart on a journey that has been far too long in the making. I intend to travel beyond the Greatwood's reaches in search of Viis who live scattered across the land, that they might join us here in Rak'tika to together preserve and pass down the wisdom of Ronka."},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"Fanow has always been my home, and it will not be easy for me to leave it behind. And yet I will leave with the knowledge that the forest is in good hands. Promise me that you will not let Ciuna get into <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> much trouble, yes?"},{"name":"CIUNA","text":"I daresay <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> are the one who needs looking after, Sister. Perhaps I should accompany you?"},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"Hah! Rest assured, I am more than capable of taking care of myself."},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"Forgive me if I refrain from stepping in the midst of this sibling squabble. Go in safety, Phyna, and know that the azure blooms will always guide you home."},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"Thank you, Master Lanille. I will return."},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"And with that, I had best be off...before I find another reason to delay my journey any longer. Young Chaqurl, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>...promise me that you will be well."},{"name":"CIUNA","text":"Phyna..."},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"And you as well, Ciuna.

But it is time we returned to the road again ourselves. We must pay our respects to Valan and Quinfort, after all."},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"Very well. We will not keep you any longer. Do pass along our respects to our friends in Slitherbough. I was not certain what to think of that Quinfort at first, but he has proved a loyal friend."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"But of course! Should you ever have time, do come visit Father and I. Nothing would make me happier than to be able to show you around the Stopple!"},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"The Qitari, the Night's Blessed... The empire may have fallen, but it would seem Ronka has as many allies today as ever. I am truly blessed to have been able to live to see this day."},{"name":"CIUNA","text":"It won't be the same with Sister away, but she shall return someday. In the meantime, there is no time to sit around feeling lonely─I will have to work harder than ever to protect our forest from those who would cause it harm."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"In addition to the medicine, I offered an invocation to the great serpent in the name of each and every one of the afflicted. Judging from the spring in Valan's step, I daresay my prayers were heard!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Master Valan! Are you certain you should be up and about like this?"},{"name":"VALAN","text":"Have no worries, my little friend. I'm feeling like my old self again. I hear that all is well again in the Stopple, too─that's truly a relief."},{"name":"VALAN","text":"I shudder to think of what would have happened to all of us here in the Greatwood if you hadn't made your discovery. Truly, we owe a debt of gratitude to your ancestors and their wisdom."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"And truly, we all owe a debt to the Great Serpent of Ronka, by whose divine auspices young Chaqurl was led to the stela on which the cure was inscribed! Yes, praise be to the serpent! Praise be!"},{"name":"VALAN","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Do you think you could keep your voice down a bit? Some of us are still recuperating from a life-threatening plague, you know."},{"name":"VALAN","text":"Speaking of which, Chaqurl...whatever made you think that little fellow was the great serpent in the first place? When Quinfort first started rambling on to that end, I thought he'd finally lost the last of his wits."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"An excellent question, Valan─and one I have been giving some thought to myself. Father had always told me tales of how the Ronkans worshipped a great serpent as their guardian and protector, but there were no clear records of its physical appearance."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"On the night that darkness returned to the skies, the small creature we now know well arrived before us wearing that curious hat."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Intrigued, I followed after it. It led me through the Ravel, where I saw that the passage to our an-<span class=\"emphasis\">central</span> homeland was at long last open once more."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Jumping for joy, I picked the small creature up and ran home to share the news with Father. With a tear in his eye, he gazed at me deeply and spoke these words: “The great serpent itself has arrived to guide us home.” In that moment, I knew it must be so."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"A moment of divine inspiration, no doubt, and not altogether unlike my own! Yes, this is most fascinating, indeed."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"In my own case, the great serpent has appeared before me in my visions for as long as I can remember. Time and again, it shared with me the words of wisdom that I have so dutifully recorded as the <span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel of Quinfort</span>."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"One day, it called out to me with a terrifying scree, warning of a great calamity that was to befall the Greatwood if I did not rise to action. It was shortly after that we came upon that tiny creature in the forest, and I recognized it immediately as the incarnation of our divine protector."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"It is clear now that all was leading up to this day. Its first appearance in my visions, our meeting─all has been part of the great serpent's grand design to restore peace, harmony, and prosperity to the forest!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Truly, we would never have been able to rediscover our history, nor overcome the spread of the plague were it not for the serpent's guidance and wisdom."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Clearly, your forefathers revered the great serpent, as well. Why else would they have engraved it atop the final stela, buried deepest and furthest from the sin eaters' reach?"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Now, this immaculately preserved stela stands before us as incontrovertible proof that this tiny creature is indeed that which we all instinctively perceived it to be─the manifestation of Ronka's divine protector who hath come once more in our time of need to guide our peoples through trying times and into a new generation of peace and prosperity!"},{"name":"TSUCHINOKO","text":"Scree!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Last time, after its work was done, the great serpent left us, going off to some place where only gods dare to tread."},{"name":"VALAN","text":"Actually, it's just been following <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> about on <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> adventures, you know..."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"What nonsense is this, Valan? Clearly, the great serpent has been watching over us all this time."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"In any event, it is clear that we owe the serpent a debt of gratitude. It would be remiss for us not to make a pilgrimage to a site where we might properly pay obeisance."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"I would like nothing more than to pay o-<span class=\"emphasis\">seib</span>-ance, Master Quinfort...but there is no telling where the serpent has gone. Where might we go that it might hear our words?"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Fear not, my young Qitari friend, for I know just the place. The ancestral slumbering place of the great serpent─the mighty crystal that has appeared before me time and again in my visions."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"I speak of none other than Fruit of the Protector, cradled amidst the waters of Lake Tusi Mek'ta. Valan and I make the trek there nigh every day to express our gratitude to the great serpent for deigning to share its divine guidance with us."},{"name":"VALAN","text":"Don't look at me like that, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I didn't go <span class=\"emphasis\">every</span> time, and when I did it was just to keep Quinfort here out of trouble!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"And just how should we go about expressing our <span class=\"emphasis\">glad</span>-itude to the great serpent?"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"An astute question, my young friend! If you wish, I would be happy to share with you some choice passages from the <span class=\"emphasis\">Gospel of Quinfort</span> that would be most suitable for the occasion. For example, there is chapter fifteen, verse five, which begins as follows: “O, hearken unto the heavenly scree...”"},{"name":"VALAN","text":"Never mind Quinfort's ramblings. I'm sure the serpent would appreciate it all the more if you thanked it in your own words. And so would the rest of us...trust me."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Er...thank you, Valan. I believe I will do just that."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Ah, but of course! How could I forget chapter nine, verse eleven!? And chapter two, verse two! Oh, if only I had the time to share the entire gospel with my Qitari friend!"},{"name":"VALAN","text":"I was afraid Quinfort's ramblings would go to Chaqurl's head, but the boy seems to have a good head on his shoulders."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Well, here I am. But...what words can truly convey my feelings to the great serpent?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"“O, hearken unto the heavenly scree...”"},{"name":"A1","text":"You could just say...“thank you.”"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Perhaps I should just keep it simple. Yes..."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Oh, great serpent! Thank you ever so much for watching over us! You have my most sincerest <span class=\"emphasis\">glad</span>-itude!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"It was by your guidance that my people have reclaimed our history, and that I have made so many new friends and allies! I promise that we will never forget you, and to pass down tales of you for generations and generations to come!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Wh-What's happening!?"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Do...do you think the serpent heard my words?"},{"name":"TSUCHINOKO","text":"Scree! Scree!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"When the crystal glimmered and glowed, it almost felt like it was speaking to me. Do you believe this means the serpent heard my words?"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"At the very least, I take heart in knowing that I have conveyed my thanks to the serpent, and to all of our new friends throughout the forest. And with this, I can return to Father and the Stopple with my head held high."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"I cannot thank you enough for accompanying my son throughout the forest. To the end, you have gone above and beyond on our behalf. It is a debt of gratitude the Qitari will not soon forget."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"In reclaiming our heritage and history, we have also rekindled time-honored bonds of friendship with our fellow residents of Rak'tika."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"The Night's Blessed, the Viis, the great serpent...and not the least of all, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, ally of Ronka─all have played a part in events that will be etched in the annals of history."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Yes, the Stewards shall see to it that these events are handed down to our children, and our children's children, and so on until long after we ourselves are gone. You have our word."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"In the meantime, we shall continue our excavation of the tunnels beneath the Stopple. I have even considered commissioning the creation of a new stela, on which all we have gleaned in recent days may be recorded for posterity."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Father and I might not have seen eye to eye in our in-<span class=\"emphasis\">pert</span>-tretations of history, but I can assure you that we are of a like mind regarding the future we would forge for our people!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"&lt;sniff&gt; Oh, how you have grown, Chaqurl! It nigh brings a tear to my eye..."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Thank you for everything, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I know that there are many places you must journey, but know that you will always have a home here in the Stopple!
