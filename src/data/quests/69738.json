Adventurer! I find myself in need of assistance. You will help me, won't you?"},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"You see, I received an order for custom paints, but the necessary ingredients are rather rare. The amra in particular is difficult to come by, as it must be taken from a vajralangula."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"And not just any old fruit will do! Only one held by the strongest, most virile male specimen will suffice."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"I know of a sure way to attract a suitable vajralangula, but I'm afraid defeating the beast is beyond me. If only a strong, brave, kind adventurer could protect poor little me!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"I'm at your service!"},{"name":"A1","text":"I expect a handsome reward."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"I feel safer already! Come now, I will lead you to where the vajralangula gather. We head southeast."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"I've kept you waiting long enough. Let's get to it, shall we?"},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Take this perfume and douse my frail, meager body in it. I must be as a flower dripping with sweet nectar!"},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Quickly, now! Slather it on, else I won't catch the attention of even the weakest vajralangula."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Perfect! I'm positively irresistible!"},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Now, I'll use my wiles and enticing scent to lure a vajralangula this way. You wait here, and prepare to strike him down!"},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"I'll lure a vajralangula this way. You wait here, and prepare to strike!"},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Such valiance! I could hardly tear my eyes away as you heroically slayed the beast! ...Now, the fruit, if you please."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Mmm, yes. Perfectly, succulently ripe. This will make a fine paint."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Our work here is done. Let us return to the Great Work before another vajralangula sets its sights on me."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Many thanks for your assistance, adventurer. I never imagined I could procure such a fine component for my paint."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Say, do you know why the vajralangula carry this fruit? They present them to their desired mates. Hence the scented oils. Pheromones, you see."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"The amra is also the official fruit of Thavnair. You can eat it or use it as painting material as I shall, of course, but it is also said to ward off evil, and secure a strong family lineage."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"But there's more to this fruit than mere superstition. It has sufficient antibacterial properties to be used as a household remedy to keep any family well."},{"name":"MACHOALCHEMIST","text":"Oh but listen to me, rambling on and on! Allow me to thank you once more. I hope our paths will cross again!"}],"reward":{"gil":975},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69909]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1039379","obj":{"i":1039379,"n":"Muscular Alchemist","l":3709,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69909","obj":{"i":69909,"n":"Shadowed Footsteps","g":11,"l":"Thavnair","s":527}}]}
