I have gathered what information I could concerning the beast that young Sighard bade you slay. The tales name this creature “Kujata.”"},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"Those who have witnessed Kujata in the terrifying flesh also call him the “Stampeding Mountain,” such is his immense size and bulk."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"Again, I will not seek to dissuade you from claiming vengeance for the boy's parents. In fact, I encourage it."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"But to topple this lumbering colossus, you must first become his equal in strength and ferocity. As a single step towards that distant goal, I send you to Blind Iron Mines."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"We have had word that folk are falling prey to the claws of the local galagos. It is your task to protect the weak from these unruly creatures. Learn to channel the rage inside you, and let your axe blade sing in righteous slaughter."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"Welcome back, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Your actions have saved many from needless injury and anguish."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"But though your efforts are to be commended, there is yet much work to be done. Kujata, the object of your vengeance, has trampled a farmer's wagon as he thundered through the lands of Tiller's Rest."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"The foodstuffs spilled from the overturned wain have attracted all manner of hungry predators. Without produce for the market, the farmers will surely suffer for coin this season. Your duty is thus clear: put down these rapacious scavengers and preserve the cargo."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"Once again, your capacity for carnage has been tested and proven. The creatures you defeated, however, were merely some of the many base scavengers that subsist on the scraps left in the wake of Kujata's rampages."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"To face Kujata himself, you yet require far more training. But do not despair, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"As axemaster and fellow marauder, this I swear: I will not rest until I have taught you how to wring every last onze of power from your weapon; until the blade of your axe can slice cleanly through the thickest hide, the most knotted muscle, the densest bone. This menace <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> fall by your hand."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"You may find yourself drawn to explore the possibilities offered by other disciplines and guilds. These distractions are inevitable, and, perhaps, necessary."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"But I urge you to soon return to the path of the marauder.
