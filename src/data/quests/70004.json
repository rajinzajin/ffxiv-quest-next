{"quest":{"name":"A Very Yeti Starlight","location":"Gridania","id":70004,"patch":6.0,"sort":215,"icon":101143,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1040593,"target":1040593,"genre":204,"journal":["It's that special time of year where the streets light up for the Starlight Celebration. Amh Garanjy is busy readying for the festivities at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre and may just have a special task for you.<br><br>※This quest is available for a limited time only.","Amh Garanjy welcomes you to this year's Starlight Celebration, and introduces you to her new friend─a diminutive yeti named Rudy, who appears to have something to say to her. Though you are at first at a loss to understand the words of the little snow creature, the auspice Rissai conveniently arrives on the scene. Through his interpretation, you learn of Rudy's heart-wrenching tale of rejection by his brothers, and his gratitude to the Saint of Nymeia, who saved him in his time of need after he became lost in the forest. Moved by his courage, you agree to aid him in expressing his thanks by serving as one of the saint's little helpers. Together with Rissai, you resolve to come up with a plan for how best to get Rudy involved in the Starlight Celebration.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","After some deliberation, you and Rissai come up with a plan: to have Rudy help make snowball-shaped desserts for the festivities. His role as a saint's helper decided, the little yeti's eyes light up with delight. There is one rub, however, in that neither you nor Rissai has experience in making this particular kind of confection. Fortunately, Rissai has just the person in mind, and along with Rudy you set off for the Carline Canopy to seek Mother Miounne's aid.","Thanks to Miounne, you have everything you need to make Rudy's celebratory confections─everything, that is, besides the necessary ingredients. There is shopping to be done, and Rudy is eager as always to take on the task. The first item on your list is flour from the Whistling Miller in Old Gridania.","You watch over Rudy fondly as he conducts his very first errand, managing to obtain the necessary flour with little difficulty on his own thanks to the shopping list provided by Mother Miounne. Eager to continue, he scampers off to the Botanists' Guild for the next ingredient: cooking oil.","Though his beastly appearance initially spooks the shopkeep, Rudy once again manages to triumph over the odds and successfully complete his task. Flour and cooking oil both safely in hand, you and your friends prepare to return to the Carline Canopy to start making your Starlight treats.","Mother Miounne guides you and Rudy through the confection-making process with an experienced, gentle hand, and before you know it, a full batch of delicious treats has been prepared. Confident that these will surely bring joy to every child who receives them, you leave Miounne to finish packing them up and set off to report back to Amh Garanjy, who will undoubtedly be delighted at your contribution to the festivities.","Back at the amphitheatre, Amh Garanjy is overjoyed to hear of how much Rudy has accomplished already, and expresses her wish to see him grow even more. To that end, she would offer you and your friends your next duty as the saint's little helpers, if you are up to the task."],"objectives":["Speak with Rissai.","Speak with Rissai at the Carline Canopy.","Speak with Rudy at the Whistling Miller.","Speak with Rudy.","Speak with Rudy at the Carline Canopy.","Speak with Amh Garanjy in Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."],"dialogue":[{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Greetings! Always a pleasure to meet a strapping adventurer like yourself. I'm Amh Garanjy, head celebrant in charge of the Starlight Celebration, and you've come at just the right time to assist me in preparing for the festivities! That <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> why you're here, isn't it?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Well, if it isn't my favorite adventurer! I hope you haven't forgotten about me since we last met. You'll be lending a hand with the festivities again this year, won't you? Because I could certainly use your help."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"You see, I have something of a beast problem. Nothing dangerous, I assure you! But it's not exactly my area of expertise, and I imagine a seasoned veteran such as yourself─with all your experience dealing with Eorzea's more exotic fauna─would be better suited for the task."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Come on out, Rudy!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"This little fellow is Rudy. At least, that's what I've been calling him. He appeared all of a sudden as I was making my usual preparations, and now he doesn't seem to want to leave."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"I was wary at first, but he hasn't tried to cause any trouble. I daresay he's even better behaved than some of my little helpers! I've grown so fond of him, I just couldn't resist making him a little costume. Doesn't he look adorable in it?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"The only problem is that it's as if he's trying to tell me something. It seems terribly important to him, but for the life of me I can't figure out what it might be. I don't suppose there's anything you might be able to do to help, is there?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip! Yip yip yip!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Forgive me. I know I'm asking the nigh impossible. After all, it's not as if an adventurer like yourself has the ability to commune with beasts. Oh, whatever am I to do...?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"(-???-)It looks like you could use some help, my dear."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"What!? Did... Did that squirrel just speak?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"By the Twelve! A talking squirrel!"},{"name":"A1","text":"You can understand us!?"},{"name":"A1","text":"An auspice, I presume."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"(-Talking Squirrel-)Ah, the reactions never fail to amuse. Yes, I can understand and speak your language just fine. For you see, I am what is known as an auspice─a beast proficient in the tongues of man. If you have traveled to the Far East, you may have encountered others of my kind."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"(-Talking Squirrel-)Oho! So you are familiar with my kind. Excellent. It will allow me to forgo all the tedious explanations."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"But allow me to introduce myself. I am Rissai, a wanderer who goes wherever duty, sentiment, and the sweet smell of delectable desserts take me!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"A meeting with an old friend is what called me to Eorzea, but your festivities piqued my interest. I couldn't help but overhear your conversation, and it struck me that I might be of service."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"With Rudy? You can understand him!?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"I would be a sad excuse for an auspice if I could not. So allow me to provide some enlightenment: it seems your furry little friend would entreat a favor of you."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"To wit, he is troubled by the fact that he's a bit of a runt compared to his brothers. They hardly even treat him like a real yeti, making fun of him for the tiny snowballs he makes."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Snowballs? Indeed, I heard that yetis incapacitate and capture their prey by blowing frosty balls of snow and ice."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip... Yip yip yip yip yip yip yip! Yip yip! Yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Your friend would politely point out that this is not true of all yetis. Rudy and his kin live peacefully deep in the mountains, a far cry from the savage beasts that roam Coerthas. They vie for supremacy amongst themselves not through violence, but by competing to see who can build the biggest snowballs."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Rudy was practicing making snowballs in secret to prove himself when he fell from a small precipice and got himself lost. He wandered the forest aimlessly for days, and had just about given up all hope when a white-haired fellow found and rescued him."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"The kindly fellow in question was none other than the Saint of Nymeia, he says. Saved our poor Rudy before gallivanting off to the Starlight Celebration. Rudy, alas, didn't even get a chance to thank him. So now he wishes to find the saint and properly express his gratitude."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"What a touching story. Truly, a Starlight miracle! And I do very much wish I could help, but..."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"I'm sorry, Rudy. I fear I haven't a clue where the saint is right now. He never sticks to one place for too long, you see. Always busy delivering gifts to children the realm over."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip... Yip yip..."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Just be a good boy and the saint is bound to take notice."},{"name":"A2","text":"The best way to show thanks would be to pay his kindness forward."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"That's right! You can be one of his little helpers and help bring joy to all the young ones for the Starlight Celebration! Why, if you're lucky, you might even be able to meet him again!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip...yip...yip-yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Rudy says he would be happy to help─as, for that matter, would I. At the very least, I can avail you as an interpreter. You'll be lending a hand, too, won't you?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"I understand that this is all rather sudden, but please tell me you'll agree. I'm sure it would mean the world to Rudy!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Splendid! Now, let us come up with a plan for getting this little one involved in the festivities."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"I leave Rudy in your capable hands. I do wish I could go with you, but my duties as head celebrant prevent me from leaving my post for too long."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip! Yip yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"I thank you again for your aid. Now, there must be something special Rudy can do for the children this Starlight season, but what could that be? Might you have any ideas?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip... Yip..."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"What's that you say? The snowballs you make are so tiny that no one would ever want them? Do not be so hard on yourself, my little friend!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Clearly, your talents simply lie elsewhere, and it is our job to help you find them. Perhaps you could join the choir, for example. Can you sing? Let's hear it!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yeeeeeeirp!♪"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Thank you, Rudy. That was most...unique. Unfortunately, perhaps it's not the best fit for singing Starlight carols..."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"There must be something we can do. I would hear your thoughts, adventurer."},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"We could compose a carol to better suit his voice."},{"name":"A3","text":"He could make snowballs for the snowball fight."},{"name":"A3","text":"Snowball-themed gifts should do the trick."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"We <span class=\"emphasis\">could</span>, yes. And yet, I do believe the season will be far more joyful and mellifluous if we do <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span>."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"That is a possibility, yes. But the children rather enjoy making snowballs themselves. I am not convinced that taking the task away from them would bring them much joy."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Snowball-themed gifts! Why, by the gods, I think you might be on to something!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"That reminds me... What do you think of these, pray tell? I picked them up in Ul'dah. They're some kind of traditional confection, but they look rather snowball-ish, don't they? Perhaps we could make something similar for the festival-goers to nibble on!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"That's right, Rudy! This is your chance to prove yourself once and for all! You're going to make the loveliest, most scrumptious snowball treats any yeti ever has! And we'll be with you every step of the way. You just need to have faith in yourself!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip! Yip yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Well, if it's sweets we're making, I know just the person to help─Mother Miounne at the Carline Canopy. I'm staying in a room there, and I must say I've found her confections to be second to none. Shall we, then?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Mother Miounne! There is something my friends and I would discuss with you."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Quite the motley bunch, I see. What is it that brings you all here?"},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"I see... In that case, you've come at the perfect time. I believe I know a way this might work in both of our favors."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"I'm in the midst of preparing Starlight gift boxes for the children at Bentbranch Meadows. Exotic snow-themed sweets would be a most welcome addition."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Then furnish you with said sweets we shall! Er, that is, once we figure out precisely how we're going to make them..."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"You leave that to me. I'll have a working recipe for you before you know it. In the meantime, might I ask you to pick up some of the ingredients we'll need in advance? I'll put it all on my tab, so you can simply pick everything up and bring it back here."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"It would be our pleasure! And don't you worry, Rudy─our adventurer friend and I will handle the transactions."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip! Yip yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"You'd do the shopping all by yourself, you say? <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> need only stand back and watch? If you insist..."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"What an eager little helper your friend is! Here, I've made a list of everything we need. Simply show this to the shopkeeps and they'll take care of you."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"The flour you can procure at the Whistling Miller, and the oil at the Botanists' Guild. Do try to stay warm out there, okay?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"And with that, let us be off! First stop: the Whistling Miller. With us, Rudy!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"So Rudy hands over this list of ingredients from Miounne, and the shopkeeper gives us what we need free of charge. This should be simple enough."},{"name":"WHISTLINGMILLERCLERK","text":"Is that...a baby yeti?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip!"},{"name":"WHISTLINGMILLERCLERK","text":"Is that...a baby yeti? And why is it dressed as one of the Saint of Nymeia's helpers?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip! Yip yip!"},{"name":"WHISTLINGMILLERCLERK","text":"A letter from Mother Miounne? Let's see here..."},{"name":"WHISTLINGMILLERCLERK","text":"Ah, now I see! You're running an errand for the Carline Canopy. Well, I can certainly help with that. Give me just a moment and I'll fetch you your flour."},{"name":"WHISTLINGMILLERCLERK","text":"Here you are! This should be enough to last Miounne for a while. Don't work yourself too hard, now!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip yip! Yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Well, would you look at that! It would seem our friend Rudy is a natural at this. I daresay it couldn't have gone any smoother if we did it ourselves."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Now, to the Botanists' Guild for some oil. Off we go!"},{"name":"WHISTLINGMILLERCLERK","text":"That little yeti is a friend of yours, I take it? In either event, please send Mother Miounne my regards."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"All we need now is the frying oil. With any luck, it'll go as smoothly as the last time."},{"name":"SANDRE","text":"Am I going daft, or did I just see a baby yeti dressed as one of the saint's little helpers looking this way?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip! Yip yip yip!"},{"name":"SANDRE","text":"Ack! Begone, foul beast! Back to the forest with you!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip...yip..."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Oh dear. It seems our little friend is in something of a pickle."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"We could go to his aid...but let us wait a bit still. It would give the lad more confidence were he able to overcome the predicament himself."},{"name":"SANDRE","text":"It won't leave... Oh, what to do? I'd rather not involve the Wood Wailers..."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip yip yip! Yip!"},{"name":"SANDRE","text":"Hm? A note? Could it be that you're here on an errand of sorts?"},{"name":"SANDRE","text":"Well, I'll be! Cooking ingredients for Miounne? And here I thought you some savage beast who'd wandered in here to cause trouble. If frying oil is all you need, I'd be happy to oblige. Just a moment."},{"name":"SANDRE","text":"Careful, now─it's heavy. And do take care on your way back to the Canopy, yes?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Well, would you look at that! Rudy managed fine on his own after all. And now that we have everything we need, let's head back to the Carline Canopy and get all this to Mother Miounne."},{"name":"SANDRE","text":"A baby yeti on a shopping errand... Yes, I do believe I've seen everything. Give my best to Miounne, will you?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"He had us worried for a minute, but Rudy did a fine job. Why, we may as well not have been there at all!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip! Yip yip!"},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Good to see you back safe and sound! And just look at how well you performed your errand! You really are a wonderful little helper."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"And with that, we have everything we need to make sweet Starlight treats for the children. It'll take me a little while to prepare, so how about a cup of piping hot tea while you wait?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"That would be splendid, Mother Miounne! Though I daresay it might make me crave for a little something sweet to go with it."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip yip! Yip! "},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip yip yip!♪"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Amazing! I expected nothing less from you, Miounne. Truly, your confections are simply to die for!"},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"You flatter me, Rissai. Incidentally, you might be interested to hear that this is a traditional dessert called “schneeballs”─named after an old Hellsguard word meaning snowball. A perfect fit for a yeti, wouldn't you say?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Oho! So it was no mere coincidence that they look like little snowballs!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip? Yip..."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"You know, Rudy... You shouldn't let yourself be discouraged by what your siblings might say to you. There's no shame in being different from everyone else."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"After all, just look at me! I'm hardly like all the other squirrels out there, and do I let it bother me? Not at all! We should be proud of what sets us apart from others, not ashamed."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip? Yip! Yip yip!"},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Once we finish making these, my gift boxes will be ready for delivery to Bentbranch Meadows. Speaking of which, would you like to help in handing them out? There's no better reward for hard work than watching the children's faces light up with joy."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Don't worry, you won't have to do all the work─I'll be asking the Starlight celebrants to assist as well. Well? What do you say?"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip yip yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Rudy says he'd love to─and would most appreciate if you would join us. You'll do this for him, yes?"},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"You have my thanks. We'll make a few more batches of these and pack them up into the gift boxes for you. Amh Garanjy will be able to tell you what to do from there."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Duly noted. Thank you for everything, Miounne!"},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Miounne's sweets are positively divine! I simply must bring some back for my friends in the East."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip yip yip!<br>Yip yip yip!♪"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Welcome back! I trust that everything is well with our newest little helper?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Rudy and the two of you are helping Mother Miounne make snowball-shaped confections? What a splendid idea! The children will be delighted, I'm sure."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Well done, Rudy. I'm so proud of how far you've come."},{"name":"RUDOLPH","text":"Yip yip!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"We would also like to assist in the handing out of presents at Bentbranch Meadows, if we may."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Of course! I wouldn't want you to miss out on the joy of delivering the goodies and seeing the children's smiling faces."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Please don't go anywhere just yet, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. There's more I'd like to discuss before you set off to deliver gifts to the children."}],"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}]},"next":[70005]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1040593","obj":{"i":1040593,"n":"Amh Garanjy","l":53,"q":3}},{"type":"quest","id":"70005","obj":{"i":70005,"n":"Time to Shine","g":204,"l":"Gridania","s":216}}]}
