If not, I would greatly appreciate some help with repairing this shed─it's something of a mess, at the moment."},{"name":"TUISHIRR","text":"I'm low on lumber, but it'll take ages to get the work done if I have to stop and hunt down more materials. Can you bring me four solid-looking planks, for the time being? Some of the wood from the old sunken ships ought to still be fit for use."},{"name":"TUISHIRR","text":"You're looking for wood that's not too waterlogged or splintered. Doesn't have to look appealing, as long as it's sturdy."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You notice a glittering object wedged in the crevice between two boards. Extracting it from its hiding place, you see that it's a ring─one that has fared rather poorly in the elements. Perhaps Tui-Shirr will know to whom it belongs."},{"name":"TUISHIRR","text":"Did you find the lumber?"},{"name":"TUISHIRR","text":"What's this─a ring?"},{"name":"TUISHIRR","text":"Oh, this is a customs ring! They used to serve as authorization for traders to enter Eulmore."},{"name":"TUISHIRR","text":"How do I know? Well, I used to work in the shipyard, as a matter of fact. Read a lot about its history at the time."},{"name":"TUISHIRR","text":"Someday, I'd like to rebuild one of those old ships─make it fit to sail the world on grand adventures once again. It's a far cry from stripping the same vessels for shed materials, but a man can dream."},{"name":"TUISHIRR","text":"I'll give you a portion of my pay for this job as thanks for your help. I thought about splitting my lunch with you instead, but the money is probably more portable. And considerably less ripe, at this point."}],"reward":{"gil":606},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}],"quests":[69168]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1027595","obj":{"i":1027595,"n":"Tui-Shirr","l":2952,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69168","obj":{"i":69168,"n":"Paradise Fallen","g":8,"l":"Eulmore","s":840}}]}
