Perhaps I can persuade you to take on a task for me?"},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"I trust you are aware that ceruleum tanks can be salvaged from downed magitek weaponry, yes? Excellent. As it so happens, I have just finished scouting the perimeter of the station, looking for any machina that aren't yet completely destroyed."},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"I thought my work done, but word has reached me that some warmachina have recently come to a grinding halt nearby. As much as I would like to investigate this report, I worry the things may not be completely out of commission─that they may have life enough left to strike a killing blow."},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"If you're willing, search the area northwest of the station for dormant warmachina and pilfer their tanks of ceruleum for me. See if you can succeed where I've so egregiously failed."},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"Find inactive warmachina and salvage their ceruleum tanks for me, will you? You should find some northwest of the station."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The ceruleum tank is completely empty."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You retrieve a tank containing a small amount of ceruleum."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have already tried searching this magitek."},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"Why, just look at you─ Not so much as a scratch. Now then, have you the tanks I requested?"},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"I knew you'd come through! Without this ceruleum, we might well have frozen to death. There may not be much, but we're grateful for it, believe me."},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"Still, what we have here is but a small bandage atop a very large wound. While this amount of fuel is only a stopgap measure, its discovery means that more can likely be found farther afield."},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; ...If I am to be honest, I often find myself wishing for a savior, one who will lead us into more promising times, as Emperor Solus once did. Someone who might pluck us from this sad lot."},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"But no man or woman as great as he will ever appear again─at least, not in our lifetimes. No, we've only to rely on ourselves now, to rebuild our fallen cities brick by brick, stone by stone."},{"name":"DOSSENNUS","text":"It will prove a grueling task, one that will take us years. Just thinking about it makes my head spin...but you've shown me that if we all pull our weight, it's not so unrealistic a goal. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for giving me the courage to go on."}],"reward":{"gil":735},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69929]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1037779","obj":{"i":1037779,"n":"Dossennus","l":3710,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69929","obj":{"i":69929,"n":"Strange Bedfellows","g":11,"l":"Garlemald","s":547}}]}
