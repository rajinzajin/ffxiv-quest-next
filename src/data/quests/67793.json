He notes that the muskets that the Nonmind have stolen from the Gnath are falling into disrepair, and he seeks a way to procure more without relying on their enemy. The Vath inquires to you about the goblins, who he heard were quite adept at metalworking. Seeking your help for an introduction to the goblins of Idyllshire, he excitedly sets off to prepare for his new journey. You agree to rendezvous at the border, in the west of Avalonia Fallen. <br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Just as you and the deftarm are about to depart for the hinterlands, it soon becomes evident that the Gnath have been following you. With the deftarm rendered immobile by their whispers, the task is left to you to silence them.","When the deftarm comes to his senses, he relays to you that the Gnath had been ordered to obstruct him from leaving the forelands. But he is confused as to why the Overmind gave such a command, given his trivial position among the Vath. Nevertheless, he shakes off his confusion and bids you both continue onward to the hinterlands.","You find an alarmed deftarm standing next to a deceased Illuminati goblin, and the Vath quickly explains he fired out of self-defense. Upon your explanation of how the Illuminati work in contrast to the Idyllshire goblins, he breathes a sigh of relief that he did not murder one of his possible clients. Your journey continues onwards towards Idyllshire.","Slowfix is surprised by the presence of the Vath deftarm in Idyllshire, but seems willing to oblige the request for metalwork. He points you both in the direction of Drydox, who appears to know something of Gnath weaponsmithing.","The deftarm is confused by her request for “jinglyshine,” and admits that he has none. An unimpressed Drydox agrees to create better muskets for the deftarm, but not before he toils to clear the stone rubble scattered throughout the Collectors' Quarter. The deftarm initially declines her request, remarking that such a simple labor is beneath him. But after your stern guidance, he reluctantly accepts and heads off to complete his task.","The request proves no simple task, as the deftarm struggles to clear the immense rubble. Discouraged after his fruitless attempts, he takes a break to enjoy a favorite snack: nanka eggs. Drydox, who came to check on the Vath's progress, immediately notes the eggs' foul stench and grows curious. After a single taste, the goblin takes an immediate liking to the Vathic delicacy. Seeing an opportunity, the deftarm asks Drydox to change the conditions of their arrangement, offering nanka eggs in exchange for metalwork. Drydox excitedly agrees, and a new deal is struck.","The storyteller suspects that something is indeed wrong when, once more, the deftarm fails to return promptly. He reveals to you that all Vath have a lingering connection to the Onemind, and that some retain a stronger connection than others. These Vath must fight harder to reinforce their sense of self against the whispers of the Onemind, for should they forget their purpose, they will lose their individuality and rejoin the colony of Loth ast Gnath. Fearing that the deftarm has fallen victim to their whispers, he asks you to find him and bring him back to his senses before it is too late.","You find a silent deftarm slowly shuffling towards the main colony. With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, attempt to break his entranced state by calling his name, “Deftarm!” aloud.","The Vath adventurer hears your voice and reaffirms his own identity. While now in control of his mind, it seems he lost his memory after departing from Idyllshire. Confused, he returns towards Loth ast Vath. Speak to him in front of the Adventurers' Guild.","The deftarm tells you he spoke with the storyteller about his strange experience when he gave his report, and the storyteller explained his remaining potent connection to Loth ast Gnath. While the deftarm expresses fear over the thought of losing himself once more, he surmises that his individuality may be preserved should his purpose outweigh the whispers of the Onemind. He vows to do whatever it takes to strengthen his identity as an adventurer."],"objectives":["Rendezvous with the Vath deftarm in the west of Avalonia Fallen.","Speak with the Vath deftarm.","Rendezvous with the Vath deftarm near the Arkhitekton.","Speak with Slowfix in Idyllshire.","Speak with Drydox.","Find the Vath deftarm.","Report to the Vath storyteller.","Search for the Vath deftarm near Loth ast Gnath.","With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, enter “Deftarm!” to call out to your pupil.","Speak with the Vath deftarm."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In order to undertake this quest, you must first complete the main scenario quest “A Great New Nation.”"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Well met, Master. Look how the Adventurers' Guild has grown! Our roster is filled with eager Vath, and our clients demand much more of us! Your contribution has been most welcome. Most welcome, indeed."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Though we no longer suffer from hunger, our safety is not yet guaranteed. The muskets we have stolen from the Gnath have become unreliable. They rust and break easily. What kind of adventurer fights with such poor weapons?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Our hive is young. We lack the proper metalworks to forge better muskets. The Vath with such a purpose have been hard at work securing proper resources. But it will take a long time. Too long. In the meantime, we must make do in other ways."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"I thought to ask Jantellot. But he admitted he is not well versed in musket-making. He spoke of the goblins, said they know a great deal about metalworks. But he said they are constant travelers with no true home. It is difficult to discern when they will pass through the forelands."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Idyllshire? A goblin settlement in the hinterlands? How fortunate that you would know of such a place. Master, surely you could introduce me?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"What excitement I feel, knowing I can travel on another journey! I am itching at the chance. I will prepare right now. Polish my musket, clean my mandibles... Meet me at the border in the west, guarded by the stone door, beyond the domain of the dragons."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Jantellot said the goblins are not like man. Could they be likened to dragons, I wonder? With gnashing teeth and─"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Master, they come!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Their voices were toneless. But alluring. They repeated their message. Over and over. “Halt your travels.”"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Why do they try to interfere? It frustrates me. But I will not let them win. I will keep on, to the hinterlands."},{"name":"SLOWFIX","text":"An adventurer named “Deftarm”? How strange! A gobbie name if Slowfix has ever heard one. Where is he?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Master, allow me to explain! He came out of nowhere and attacked, with a knife! I had no choice but to shoot."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"“Illuminati”? He was not from the goblin settlement we seek? Somehow, I am relieved. His savageness reminded me of the Onemind. I was worried all goblins were like him."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"I was taken aback by his face. It was so... &lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; No, never mind. Perhaps it is best not to say."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Do goblins have mouths to speak? Or do they also communicate through the mind?"},{"name":"SLOWFIX","text":"Shkohhh... Shkohhh... Behind you, uplander! Massive crawlybug armed with deadly weapon!"},{"name":"SLOWFIX","text":"Shkohhh... Not crawlybug, but walkybug? Seeks gobbie metalworkings? Happy to oblige, we are, but Slowfix is not the gobbie with whom uplander should trade tongueflaps. Seek Drydox!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Dry...dox? What purpose does one have, with a name like that?

It has been many years since Drydox saw your kind."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"I call myself the Vath deftarm. I am an adventurer, just like Master. You have met “walkybugs” like me before?"},{"name":"DRYDOX","text":"Before founding free nation in Idyllshire, gobbieflock traveled far and wide. When Drydox was small gobbie, walkybugs wielding boomsticks attacked our tent-ring."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"I see. It must have been the Onemind who attacked you. But I mean you no harm. I have come to befriend the goblins."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; But I did not expect you to be such strange-looking creatures!"},{"name":"DRYDOX","text":"Pssshmph! Did Drydox ear-catch walkybug right? Cannot tell skull from sittyparts, and he says gobbies look strange?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"My apologies. I did not mean to be rude. Slowfix tells me you can make muskets. Very good muskets. Muskets are what I seek. Like this one."},{"name":"DRYDOX","text":"Walkybug wants boomstick like this one?

If Deftarm wants boomsticks, Deftarm must go and clear away!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; I decline. Clearing away rocks is no duty for an adventurer. Adventurers fight monsters.

I thought it was supposed to be glorious."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"But you are right, Master. I am fortunate to have been given a task to perform. Clearing rocks is a worthwhile duty."},{"name":"DRYDOX","text":"Uplander, can Drydox trust you with checkwork? Make certain that walkybug clears Collectors' Quarter with fastness!"},{"name":"DRYDOX","text":"Drydox thinks walkybug would be better off returning with jinglyshine for boomsticks.

More stinkeggs, more stinkeggs!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Perhaps we can...alter the deal. If you craft boomsticks and metalworks for the Vath, I shall bring you more nanka eggs. Mountains of nanka eggs."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"What a relief that the goblins enjoy the same tastes as we. Let us return to the storyteller right away. Make the final arrangements."},{"name":"DRYDOX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh...<br>Gobbies have much respect for sweatworking."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; The deftarm is not here. Did you not see him on the main road?"},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"This bodes ill. He acts strange lately. We worry he may have strayed, to heed the whispers of the Onemind."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"Be wary of the deftarm, hunter. Our connection to the Overmind has been sundered, but all Vath have a lingering link to the Onemind. Some have a stronger link than others."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"You must have seen his struggle with the whispers as we have. The Onemind's thoughts against his. It is like a hundred voices humming in unison. He is overwhelmed and cannot act."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"To be truly freed from the threat of the Onemind, his sense of self must be powerful. Powerful enough to overcome their whispers."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"If he doubts his purpose, the link may grow stronger. He will forget himself and return to Loth ast Gnath."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; But we cannot let that happen! He is our brother! He is Vath!"},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; The Onemind must be beckoning him towards their hive. He cannot have gone far. Great hunter, you bring him back to his senses!"},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"He is young, but his will to become an adventurer is strong. We are certain he will respond to his master's voice. Swiftly now, towards Loth ast Gnath!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; ... &lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt;"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter “Deftarm!” to call out to your pupil."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Deftarm!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Deft...arm?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Yes, that is who I am!

We are relieved."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; I spoke with the storyteller. He explained what is happening to me. About why I lose my way. About why I struggle to fight the Onemind."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"I am sorry for staying silent, Master. I thought I could overcome this on my own. I thought if I declared my purpose, the voices of the Onemind would vanish. Instead, they have grown louder."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Oh, my mind, it is full of questions! Heavy questions. I fear many things. But I fear losing myself the most."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"I know! Perhaps the Onemind still calls me because my purpose is not strong enough! I must do whatever it takes, to become a capable adventurer. Accept more tasks on my own, reap more rewards! Then the Onemind will whisper no longer."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The goblins of Idyllshire are now clients of the Adventurers' Guild!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have achieved <span class=\"highlight\">Respected</span> reputation with the Vath."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"New Vath tribal daily quests are now available from the Vath keeneye."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You will receive an experience point bonus upon the completion of the Vath tribal daily quests."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Furthermore, you will be able to undertake three additional quests from the Vath keeneye as a reputation rank bonus.
