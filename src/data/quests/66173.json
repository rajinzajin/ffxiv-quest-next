To prevent the unique plants from succumbing to the desert heat, Jospaire bids you bring him some muddy water from the pond to the west.","You have collected the muddy spring water. Deliver it to Jospaire.","Not content with merely watering the greenery, Jospaire now asks you to remove the vilekin eggs that have been laid in the area before they hatch and begin to feed.","You have spared the plants a grisly death at the maws of vilekin larvae. Speak with Jospaire once more.","Little to your surprise, Jospaire has yet another request. He bids you pour stingbrew over thick bramble and slay any syrphid clouds that come forth.","You have slain enough syrphid clouds to ensure the plants' safety. Speak with Jospaire to see if the botanist has any further tasks for you.","Jospaire is elated that the plants have been saved.
