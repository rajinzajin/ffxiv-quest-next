Meet with your Confederate allies on the bank of the One River.","Determined to bring the conscripts home come what may, Hien goes through the contingency plan one last time. Roles confirmed, your party boards the Confederate ship, and you cast off for the imposing structure across the water...<br><br>※In the event that you leave Castrum Fluminis, you may re-enter by speaking with the Confederate skipper in the Glittering Basin in Yanxia.","At Castrum Fluminis, you meet with the Populares delegation, and as Hien and Asahi set about trading pleasantries, you wonder for a moment if your apprehension was unwarranted...only for Yotsuyu to appear. Declaring her intent to rule over Doma once more, she holds aloft a Kojin relic, and begins to draw upon crystals hidden within the surrounding supply crates, transforming at last into the primal Tsukuyomi.<br><br>With no hope of besting such a foe, Hien ruefully turns his attention to evacuating the Doman conscripts, leaving you to face Yotsuyu's vengeful avatar alone. Put Tsuyu from your mind, and strike true, for if you hesitate, Doma may never again see the light of day.<br><br>※Castrum Fluminis can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","Yotsuyu lies humbled at your feet, bereft of her celestial majesty. Rejoin your companions and discuss what is to be done with her.","Before you have even registered his presence, Asahi appears behind your defeated foe and shoots her in cold blood, seemingly bent on finishing what you began. His triumph is short-lived, however, as Yotsuyu summons the last of her strength to run her hated stepbrother through. While the youth lies dying, you are treated to a vision of an encounter with Zenos, and are disturbed to see the “late” crown prince injured but very much alive.<br><br>Even as you ponder how to break the news of this troubling development, Maxima hails Lord Hien from afar, and for a moment it seems that the battle is not over. But to the relief of all present, it soon becomes clear that he has come to trade words and not blows. In the ensuing exchange, the acting ambassador declares his intention to honor the original agreement between Doma and the Empire, while confirming your worst fears: Zenos is alive. Suspecting Ascian involvement, Alphinaud offers to accompany Maxima back to Garlemald, and he duly accepts. And so you bid them farewell, your relief at salvaging a chance for peace tempered by a sense of deep foreboding...","Though Hien expected treachery, he is nevertheless stunned that Asahi would resort to summoning. After thanking you for delivering Doma from the wrath of Yotsuyu's avenging primal, he makes for the sekibune, eager to escort the conscripts across the river and into the arms of their long-lost loved ones.","Upon your return to the enclave, thoughts of Zenos's resurrection and untold Ascian devilment are briefly banished by scenes of joyous reunion. You are further distracted by the appearance of a shaven-headed Gosetsu, apparently resolved to devote his remaining days to pilgrimage. And just like that, you find yourself bidding farewell to yet another companion. Feeling somewhat bereft, you turn to see Hien standing before the Kienkan, staring into the distance after his departed friend...","Hien bids you join him in his hall, that he might express his gratitude with all due ceremony.","In time-honored fashion, you stand before Doma's young lord and smile as he thanks you with a bow on behalf of his people. Then, formalities observed, his manner softens, and he proceeds to share his thoughts on how Gosetsu came to show the broken Yotsuyu such kindness. Though the old samurai is forever changed and Tsuyu now no more than a memory, Hien concludes that their time together, however brief, offered a priceless respite from the bitterness of life."],"objectives":["Speak with the Confederate skipper in the Glittering Basin.","Confront Tsukuyomi in Castrum Fluminis.","Speak with Hien.","Speak with Hien at the Doman Enclave.","Speak with Hien."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Alphinaud tells me they had little trouble finding a suitable route out of the castrum, but he won't say much more than that.

'Twas a simple matter to plot the surest path out. H-Hence our swiftness."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"We found the castrum's tower unoccupied, and betraying no signs of recent activity. Only shadows and echoes awaited us there. Alphinaud seemed oddly reluctant to linger, but I saw naught to concern us."},{"name":"KIENKANGATEKEEPER03028","text":"Lord Hien is expecting you. May I show you in?"},{"name":"EVENTAREA","text":"Enter the Kienkan?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"While we were putting our contingency plans in place, I left Hakuro in charge of organizing transport for the imperial prisoners."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"He will see they arrive at the appointed hour, leaving us free to rendezvous with our Confederate allies. Come, they await us on the riverbank not far from the castrum."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"The tower rather spoils the view across the river, does it not. I concede, we might perhaps have chosen a less ominous place to conduct the exchange..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Would that we had some hint as to the ambassador's intentions...<br>Had we not prepared for the worst, I should be wary of going through with this at all."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"No matter what Asahi throws at us, we cannot let that monster have his way."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"My only concern is the safe return of our people. That is what my lord wishes, and that is what shall be done."},{"name":"RASHO","text":"Do not worry about the ship. It will be where it needs to be. And with Tansui at the helm."},{"name":"BOATMAN03074","text":"Your party is assembled, then?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Aye, and ready for what lies ahead, I trust. Lest there be any confusion, though... The tower across the water is to be the scene of the exchange─that, and whatever else Asahi has planned."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"But regardless of the ambassador's intentions, we <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> bring our people home.

She will see you safely home."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Then all stand ready to play their part. Come! Let us be about it!"},{"name":"BOATMAN03074","text":"Are you ready to depart for the castrum, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>?"},{"name":"EVENTAREA","text":"Travel to Castrum Fluminis?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Ah, Alphinaud...you impulsive fool.<br>I thought about trying to talk him out of it, but I know what I would say if the roles were reversed. Stubbornness is something of a family trait."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Gosetsu dragged himself here from his sickbed, only to be greeted by the sight of Yotsuyu's corpse. I had not the words to comfort him..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"I knew Asahi was planning some manner of treachery, but a <span class=\"emphasis\">summoning</span>...? Thank the kami you were here, my friend. None of us would have escaped Yotsuyu's vengeance had you not intervened."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"She was a pawn, aye, but she still had a choice, and she chose to submit to the ambassador's plan. 'Tis little wonder Gosetsu departed in silence."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"I gather he left the same way he came: alone aboard a rowing boat. As for the conscripts, most made it to the sekibune before the battle began in earnest, but the vessel yet waits on the riverbank for those who did not flee in time."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Then I suggest we put this doleful place behind us, and make for the enclave together. 'Twould be a shame to miss the joyous reunion!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It will be far too quiet without Gosetsu around. I wonder if we'll ever see him again...<br>Oh, speaking of reunions, have you spoken with Ihanashi? It turns out his father <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span> among the returning conscripts."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Gosetsu relinquished his duties with a grace befitting a samurai lord. I only hope that I can fill the void which he has left behind..."},{"name":"IHANASHI","text":"Thank the kami you spotted that cracked plank! That ship ended up bringing my father home!"},{"name":"IHANASHI","text":"And the captain said─ Well, let's just say I'm not a pirate anymore. I'm going to live in Doma with my father. We're free!"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Ah, Gosetsu... Fair journey to you, my friend."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"A bittersweet occasion...but there is yet ample cause to be grateful! Pray join us in the Kienkan. I would thank you properly."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"With all of that out of the way, Doma <span class=\"emphasis\">should</span> be able to look forward to a period of relative calm. As for us...well, we have an intriguing story to tell everyone back at the Rising Stones."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Lord Hien trained under Gosetsu from the day he was old enough to hold a sword. Though he smiled through all the farewells, none will feel his absence more keenly."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Our brothers and sisters are returned to us, and the dream of Doma's restoration is that much closer to being realized. It is a day that will live long in memory, and one that would never have dawned without the courageous actions of the Scions. On behalf of Doma and her people, we give you our deepest thanks."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Lest you think me complacent, I assure you, I have not forgotten the dark cloud on the horizon. That Zenos lives is a source of grave concern─mayhap the gravest─yet there is little to be done but wait for Alphinaud to send word. Until then, I plan to devote myself to fulfilling the promise I made to Gosetsu, by building a nation in which none need live in fear."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; I confess, I miss him already. But the thought that he has at last found peace goes some way to softening the blow.<br>I wonder, did you ever stop to ask yourself why he showed Yotsuyu such kindness?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"I believe the answer lies in past tragedy─specifically, the death of his wife and daughter during the invasion. Though he hid it well, they were never far from his thoughts, and in Yotsuyu's childlike mien, I believe he saw not a fallen tyrant, but the little girl who was lost to him."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"After the loss of his family, Gosetsu devoted himself wholly to the service of his country. He suffered any hardship, strove beyond the limits of endurance without hesitation or complaint."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Though Tsuyu could never truly replace his daughter, I had hoped that with her at his side, he might live out the remainder of his days in relative contentment..."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Would that the kami had been so minded. Even now, I labor to discern any meaning in Yotsuyu's fate. To deliver her from certain death, with no memory of her sins, only to leave her at the mercy of her stepbrother? Can that truly have been their will?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"That I cannot tell you. The will of the kami is not for us to know."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"But what I <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> know is that for a brief moment, a girl known as “Tsuyu” lived among us..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"...And that she brought with her a whisper of respite for a grieving heart."}],"reward":{"gil":3000,"instance":20055},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":142}],"quests":[68609]},"next":[68566,68611]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1024999","obj":{"i":1024999,"n":"Hien","l":2847,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1025597","obj":{"i":1025597,"n":"Hien","l":2847,"q":7}},{"type":"instance","id":"20055","obj":{"i":20055,"n":"Castrum Fluminis","c":61804,"t":"Trials","min_lvl":70,"max_lvl":70,"min_ilvl":335}},{"type":"quest","id":"68609","obj":{"i":68609,"n":"Conscripts and Contingencies","g":7,"l":"Kienkan","s":23}},{"type":"quest","id":"68566","obj":{"i":68566,"n":"A Fortune in Salt","g":103,"l":"Rhalgr's Reach","s":10040}},{"type":"quest","id":"68611","obj":{"i":68611,"n":"Under the Moonlight","g":7,"l":"Kienkan","s":25}}]}
