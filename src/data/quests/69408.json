Believing that the presence of a true hero would go a long way to lift the spirits of the garrison, he asks that you report to General Raubahn at the Ceruleum Processing Plant and offer your services.","Raubahn bids you rally the garrison at the Ceruleum Processing Plant. Make your way around the plant and /psych up the green recruits whose resolve appears to be failing.","Your visceral gesticulations have helped the recruits steel themselves for the battle to come. Now go to Lieutenant Edelstein and /psych him up as you did the recruits.","Lieutenant Edelstein admits that the fire of his resolve had grown dim, and thanks you for making it rage anew. With both the Bull of Ala Mhigo and your good self present, the entire garrison is fairly ablaze with determination."],"objectives":["Speak with Raubahn.","Find recruits and /psych them up.","Go to Edelstein and /psych him up."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To accept this quest, you must abandon the current main scenario quest.

I mentioned that I was hoping you might raise the flagging spirits of the men and women of our garrison."},{"name":"CRACKEDFIST","text":"Worry not, it is no unnecessarily laborious task that we ask of you. The mere presence of a hero such as you walking in their midst would no doubt serve to restore in them a measure of morale."},{"name":"CRACKEDFIST","text":"And so I ask of you this: make your way to the Ceruleum Processing Plant, and report to General Raubahn once you have arrived.

I was hoping that your presence alone might serve to raise spirits some."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Unfortunately, it would seem that many are too preoccupied wallowing in fear and self-pity that they have yet to even notice you have arrived."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Might I ask you to make the rounds and share a few words of encouragement to those men and women whose spirit falters? I had a mind to do it myself, but I am quite certain it would carry more weight coming from you."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Once you have seen to the others, go and do the same for Edelstein. No matter what he may claim, the lieutenant would also be better for a bit of rousing. Trust me, I <span class=\"emphasis\">know</span>."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"About the camp, there are green recruits whose resolve falters.
