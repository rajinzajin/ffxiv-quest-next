Having heard that the wyvern is somewhat of a cloudfish connoisseur, he has sent one of his best anglers out to catch one to present to him. However, as usual, the mogfisher has not returned yet. Search for him at the Landlord Colony.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","You speak with the mogfisher, who is happy to see an expert crafter before him just as he lost his last lure. He asks that you use your skills to create a new one of exceptional quality so that he may continue to search for the perfect fish to give Whei Ahf.","You receive materials with which to create the tackle from Mogwon, who is apparently the younger brother of the mogfisher. Craft the best tackle you can so that the mogfisher can return to his work. <br><br>※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Mogwon.","You deliver your highest quality tackle to the mogfisher, who is more than satisfied with your craftsmanship. Playfully chiding you that a fisher never gives away his secrets, he asks that you rendezvous with him at Tharl Oom Khash after he has caught one that he feels will serve as an excellent gift.","You meet up with the mogfisher, who hands over a cloudfish that he has never seen before, judging it to be a rare treat for a hungry wyvern. Return to Bahrr Lehs and speak with the dextrous dragonet so that Whei Ahf may receive his gift from the moogles.","The dextrous dragonet's mouth starts watering at the sight of the cloudfish, but he calls Whei Ahf nonetheless. The wyvern is surprised and honored to be given such a rare delicacy that he had not seen in a long time. He asks that you express his gratitude to Mogek.","Mogek is happy you were able to have a larger hand in the surprise, in both creating the tackle to catch the fish and bestowing it upon Whei Ahf. As a passing thought, he expresses relief that Whei Ahf recognized the cloudfish, as it would be a disaster to give him an unidentified poisonous one."],"objectives":["Search for the mellow moogle at the Landlord Colony.","Speak with Mogwon.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize the cloudfish lure <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"></span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the cloudfish lure <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to the mellow moogle</span></span>.","Speak with the mellow moogle at Tharl Oom Khash.","Deliver the undiscovered cloudfish to the dextrous dragonet.","Report to Mogek the Marvelous."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOGEK","text":"Oh, good, good! I wanted to speak to you while Whei Ahf is away. You see, he has done so much for us, and we wanted to give him a worthy gift."},{"name":"MOGEK","text":"If you didn't know already, Whei Ahf is quite the connoisseur of cloudfish, kupo! We sent one of our best mogfishers to search for the perfect catch to present to him, but he seems to be taking his time, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGEK","text":"Sooo could you possibly...you know? Kupo?"},{"name":"MOGWON","text":"Well if it isn't <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Those training supplies you made for us proved so durable, we're planning to pass them down to the new recruits, kupo!"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"Drats! Foiled again! And that was my last lure, too..."},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"Oh, hello there. Say, you're <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, aren't you? My younger brother Mogwon never tires talking of your craftsmanship."},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"Perhaps the fates have conspired to bring you here. For hours I get not so much as a nibble until my last lure is snatched away, and a moment later an expert artisan like yourself appears before me. Please, lend me your help, kupo!"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"I beg you craft me a new fishing lure. One made of metal that catches the light so splendidly that even I would be drawn to its radiance!"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"I beg you craft me a new fishing lure. One that bears such a striking resemblance to a small cloudfish that even I would get confused!"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"I beg you mold me bait in the shape of a cloudfish. One so tasty that even I would be tempted to take a bite!"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"If you need materials, go and visit Mogwon in Asah. He would gladly hand over some for you to use."},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"I'll wait for you right here, kupo! Fishermoogles are used to being patient."},{"name":"DRAGONPUPPY02314","text":"Whei Ahf is out hunting right now. But do visit again if you are in need of his wings."},{"name":"MOGWON","text":"My brother lost another lure? Well, normally I'd complain, but this time, I'm sure you'll create one of exceptional quality so that he'd be more careful with it."},{"name":"MOGWON","text":"Here you are, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGWON","text":"Do you need more materials? By all means, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGWON","text":"Are you all set then? My brother may be a mogfisher, but I'm sure he's eager to get back to reeling in his catches."},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"I tried finding some worms to use as bait without much success. Have you finished making the lure?"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"Beautiful work, kupo! Why, if I didn't know it was a lure, I'd love and cherish it as a pet, kupo! "},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"Well then, I shall try it out at my best spot and see what I can hook! No following me, now! A master mogfisher never reveals his secrets!"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"...Of course, I would be an idiot not to try out Tharl Oom Khash, where all the boastful catches are found. Let us meet there after I try out this new lure. I'll try not to disappoint, kupo!"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"This tackle you made for me is superb, kupo! As soon as I lowered my fishing pole over the cliffside, my line wouldn't stop trembling!"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"Out of all of my catches, I believe this one is the finest. As a mogfisher, I've seen all manner of common cloudfish, but this particular one is unknown to me. To a dragon, that would be a rare treat, right?"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"Huzzah, I did it! My finest catch yet, kupo!"},{"name":"DRAGONPUPPY02314","text":"Well come, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">daughter</span><span class=\"alternative\">son</span></span> of man, did you wish to speak to Whei─"},{"name":"DRAGONPUPPY02314","text":"&lt;gasp&gt; What a succulent-looking fish! ...For Whei Ahf, I imagine? I shall summon him for you right away."},{"name":"DRAGONPUPPY02314","text":"This adventurer and the moogles have something for you."},{"name":"WYVERN02314","text":"Such a delicacy I have not seen in an age.

Pray give my thanks to the moogles."},{"name":"DRAGONPUPPY02314","text":"Whei Ahf gave me a taste of that cloudfish you gave him. I have never eaten anything so delicious! Next time, will you bring me one, too?"},{"name":"FISHINGMOOGLE02314","text":"Every mogfisher has a preferred lure, and this one is quickly becoming my favorite, kupo! Each time I reel it in, a new surprise is wriggling on the end!"},{"name":"MOGWON","text":"&lt;grumble&gt; Although I hope my brother knows that our resources in Asah aren't unlimited. He can't just expect me to give him materials for tackle every time he loses one. This has to be the fifth time, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGEK","text":"I'm so glad you had a direct hand in helping us express gratitude to Whei Ahf for his assistance to the Mogmenders. We couldn't have done it without you, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGEK","text":"I am also somewhat relieved that Whei Ahf recognized it. The mogfisher said he wasn't sure what kind of fish it was, so it would be a disaster if it was poisonous."},{"name":"MOGEK","text":"At any rate, thank you so much for your help! Until next time!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Normal-quality items crafted in the course of this quest serve no purpose and cannot be sold.
