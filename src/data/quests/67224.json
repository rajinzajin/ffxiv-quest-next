The blades in the shadows are no doubt loyal to Redway, waiting to attack you when you are most vulnerable. Oboro bids you give them a target, by patrolling and pretending to /doze, then striking back.","The unwanted visitors are no more. Tell Oboro as much.","Though Oboro had come up with a plan to sneak across to Hullbreaker Isle, the recent attack on the storehouse has changed his mind. If Redway has seen fit to send assassins to your hideout, no doubt unfriendly eyes watch the docks, as well. Oboro reasons the wisest course of action now is to see what opposition awaits you, and asks that you join him at the Moraby Drydocks.","Crouched on a battlement, you and Oboro look out over the harbor in dismay. There are too many guards to fight. However, your friend is not without a plan. He supposes that since it is <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> who is bound by duty to save Princess Yuki, he is therefore free to put himself at risk and draw Redway's attention. This will allow you to sneak across the channel in the boat Jacke has provided. Retreat to Oschon's Torch and wait for your moment.","Redway has gleefully captured Oboro, and left with his men. After pacifying an agitated Akagi, the two of you resolve to infiltrate the Truehounds' camp on Hullbreaker Isle. Speak with him at the Moraby Drydocks.","You have spoken with Akagi. Approach him again when you are ready to board the boat to Hullbreaker Isle.","Rosalinde promised the captive vassals' freedom in exchange for the treasures of the Yatsurugi clan. However, the captain goes back on her word when Princess Yuki brings them, and orders her bound and stowed with the other prisoners. Just as all hope seems lost, you appear with Akagi. Princess Yuki finally commands you to rescue her. You draw your daggers, slash Oboro's bonds, and take the fight to Redway. When the sellsword realizes he is losing, he makes to run─only to meet a gory end on Rosalinde's axe blade. After the battle continues, you finally put an end to the cutthroat captain's reaving for good. Their leader dead, the remaining Truehounds run, leaving behind all the treasures of the Yatsurugi clan. Princess Yuki offers her heartfelt thanks, and then turns excitedly to her freed vassals. With the profits from these treasures, her lands can be rebuilt. Oboro indicates it is time to take your leave. Speak with him in the dock storehouse.","Oboro congratulates you for the successful completion of your first mission. Truly, few other shinobi could have earned their master's trust as you earned Princess Yuki's. Now, he bids you meditate upon your experiences, and continue upon the path towards mastery of the art of ninjutsu.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Oboro once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"],"objectives":["/doze at the designated spots and slay the intruders.","Speak with Oboro.","Speak with Oboro at the Moraby Drydocks.","Lie in wait near Oschon's Torch.","Speak with Akagi.","Speak with Akagi again.","Speak with Oboro at the dock storehouse.","Defeat the Truehounds and save Princess Yuki!"],"dialogue":[{"name":"AKAGI","text":"P-Princess, I...I failed you..."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Do not raise your voice, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. The woods are filled with hostile ears..."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"I have no doubt the shadows that surround us are Redway's. How he found us, I cannot say."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"But why? His hostages already shield him. Does his fear so consume him that he would slit our throats while we are helpless? This is cowardice...or madness."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"His men will try to catch us unawares. I say we let them."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Go and patrol the outside. Pretend to <span class=\"highlight\">doze</span> off at some point. Our foes will strike. Once they do, make sure they do not live to report to Redway."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Do not worry about me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. If any shadows enter here, I will ensure they do not leave."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Defeat the enemies that appear when you pretend to <span class=\"highlight\">doze</span> on patrol."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Thank you. I sense we are free of unwanted visitors."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Akagi is on the mend. We have seen our duty through. Now, the princess awaits our rescue!"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"I spoke with Jacke, and he has commandeered a boat for us. The plan <span class=\"emphasis\">had</span> been to slip across to Hullbreaker Isle from the Moraby Drydocks and find the princess..."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"However, if Redway sent his cutthroats here, he will not have neglected the docks. The place is likely swarming with guards. It would be unwise to continue without reconnaissance."},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"I...I'd only slow you down if I went, wouldn't I?"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You have only just healed, Akagi. Princess Yuki wants to keep you safe, and you would serve her best by remaining here."},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"Er...all right. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I'm entrustin' her life to you. Please, <span class=\"emphasis\">please</span> bring her back safe."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"What are you waiting for, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"No, really, you don't have to check up on me. I'm fine stayin' here. Too much of a coward to be of much use, anyway. Ahaha...ha..."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"This is even worse than I'd imagined. There are Truehounds everywhere. We cannot risk open battle. Princess Yuki will die if even <span class=\"emphasis\">one</span> escapes our blades..."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"I have a plan. But you will not like it. Tell me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─do you recall what the princess ordered you to do?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What was Princess Yuki's order?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Stay alive."},{"name":"A1","text":"..."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Exactly."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"She ordered you to stay alive. I hope your silence is stoic, and not because you had forgotten."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You are bound to her, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span>. I am not. I am an ally, and my death means nothing in the eyes of duty. But if you die without delivering the princess from danger, then as a shinobi, you have failed your mission."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You must live to save her. So...I must be the pawn, and I must be sacrificed."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Redway's eyes are on me. If I surrender, he will lower his guard, giving you the chance to sneak over to the isle."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"...I <span class=\"emphasis\">did</span> say you would not like it. But it is the only way. I hope you are ready. Ahem..."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"I <span class=\"emphasis\">trusted</span> you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! And now, you show your true colors! Craven, I call you! You are no shinobi─you are a <span class=\"emphasis\">mistake</span>! I should never have taught you the ways of my village! Get out of my sight!"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"...Whew. Forgive me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I had to give them a reason to believe we parted. No matter what happens to me, you cannot interfere."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Now, the princess has only one shinobi. Watch for your chance to save her. Her fate─<span class=\"emphasis\">our fates</span>─are in your hands."},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"You slew <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> the sellswords I sent to find you? Perhaps I should have spent more on them and less on buying the location of your little shack. Well, a good lesson for the future."},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"But <span class=\"emphasis\">really</span>, Oboro, how could you be so stupid? You could have fled with <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! But did you? No. You scurried back, like a child who hasn't learned to fear his father's fist!"},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"I <span class=\"emphasis\">told</span> you I'd slit the princess's throat if you came after her. I still may, if you don't comply. So, come along, or she'll die. Screaming, yes."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Bastard! Have you no honor!? Don't hide behind your hostages─<span class=\"emphasis\">fight me</span>!"},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"Ahahaha! Why should I? You and your honor have <span class=\"emphasis\">lost</span>. Your way─the traditional way─is out. In with the <span class=\"emphasis\">new</span>!"},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"Change requires sacrifice, Oboro. Your village, for example. I'll lure your elders into the open with you and lay waste to your houses. Then, I'll build the shinobi anew in <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> image. Simple, yes?"},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"Ahhh, if only that were today... Maybe I'll keep you alive to see it. Now, <span class=\"emphasis\">heel</span>, Oboro. Your princess awaits."},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Why're you skulkin' back here when your friends are in danger!?"},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"T-Traitor! You... Damn you, shinobi! The princess was right─I should never've trusted you! Go! Come on, get! I'll save her my own bloody self!"},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"What? Just a mummery!? Oboro...Oboro's put his life in danger <span class=\"emphasis\">for</span> the princess?"},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"Ahhh...haha! I knew that! Never doubted you, not for one second!"},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"I've bound my leg proper. I can run on it, an' fight on it, too! I won't win renown back home if I just let the shinobi do it all, eh? Let's take the battle to them!"},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"Thank you, my friend. You won't regret it! Now, to the Moraby Drydocks!"},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"Not a guard left. I suppose Redway's got them all keepin' watch over Oboro."},{"name":"AKAGI","text":"Well, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, it's now or never─let's get across to that island. Oboro said somethin' about a boat..."},{"name":"KASHIN01688","text":"Princess, forgive us! We never meant to cost you the treasures!"},{"name":"ROSALINDE","text":"Aye, that's the lot. Good to have the plunder back."},{"name":"YUKI","text":"You have what you came for, Rosalinde! Now release my people!"},{"name":"ROSALINDE","text":"Lads, I remember seein' an empty pair o' shackles in the brig. Stow the princess belowdecks along with the others!"},{"name":"YUKI","text":"What!? No! You gave me your word! You said─"},{"name":"ROSALINDE","text":"Ye <span class=\"emphasis\">believed</span> I'd actually barter treasures fer hostages!? Ahahaha! Ain't a reason in the realm fer me to keep that promise, child!"},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"Captain, I caught him! Allow me to present Oboro─the <span class=\"emphasis\">last</span> of the princess's would-be rescuers."},{"name":"YUKI","text":"O-Oboro!? Why, <span class=\"emphasis\">why</span> did you follow me!?"},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"Oboro's disciple ran away, Captain. Yes.

These so-called shinobi were never a match for me."},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"And the new order will follow <span class=\"emphasis\">me</span>, fight for <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> attention, and beg for <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> teachings! Yes, yes, yes!"},{"name":"ROSALINDE","text":"See, Princess? I paid for Redway with cold, hard coin. And <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> got yerself two rat-eared ninjas...with what? Promises? Hah! Ye get what ye pay for!"},{"name":"ROSALINDE","text":"What's this? Is the Iron Orchid wiltin'? Ye lost yer baubles, ye lost yer bodyguards, an' failed yer people! How's it feel, eh?"},{"name":"MOB01688","text":"AAAAAAAAARGH!"},{"name":"REDWAY","text":"Y-You! No...no, no! You're not supposed to be here! Get away! Leave!"},{"name":"YUKI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? <span class=\"emphasis\">Akagi</span>!?"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Tell me, Princess─how <span class=\"emphasis\">does</span> it feel, knowing you are not alone?"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You need not despair, Princess. Here are two who still serve in <span class=\"emphasis\">your</span> name! Please, trust to them!"},{"name":"YUKI","text":"...Save me. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I order you to defeat these dogs!"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You have your duty, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"KASHIN01688","text":"Princess! Thank the heavens you're safe!"},{"name":"YUKI","text":"And what about you? Are you hurt? We can seek treatment upon returning to town."},{"name":"YUKI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>... I was lucky to have a shinobi like you in my service. For all my skill, I couldn't have done this alone. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart."},{"name":"YUKI","text":"The treasures of the Yatsurugi clan are mine. Their sale will buy tools for farming and storehouses for our grain. With hard work, our lands will prosper!"},{"name":"KASHIN01688","text":"You have our thanks as well, shinobi. The princess is the standard we rally to, the beacon that will lead us to restoring our nation. There are not words to express our gratitude for defending her."},{"name":"YUKI","text":"Well, I hope now our lands will be free of winter. May the snows melt in the spring sun and deliver us from our cold, parched lives. Come, my friends─let's go home, and rebuild!"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You completed your mission, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, and saved a country and her people. Remember this moment, to look back upon with pride in your heart."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Well, I think we must away. The storehouse awaits, as do long meditations on today's events."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"That was a promising first mission, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Only one most skilled in our art could have earned Princess Yuki's trust as you did. But for now, the time for excitement has passed, and I am looking forward to quiet meditation."},{"name":"YUKI","text":"Oboro! Oboro! So <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span> is where you vanished to!"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Princess? Had you not started homewards?"},{"name":"YUKI","text":"I had something to tell you before I left. I plan to send a formal note of thanks for the duties you performed in my name, from the Yatsurugi clan to your village."},{"name":"YUKI","text":"Your people and mine both must rebuild. I thought a letter might spark a friendship. But I'm unsure of your customs─should I just address it to your village elders?"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Yes, that would be perfect. The village would welcome your friendship, Princess. Thank you fo─ Wait, to the village elders?"},{"name":"YUKI","text":"All right, it shall be done! Thank you, Oboro. I look forward to meeting again, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"N-No! The elders think I have stayed in Eorzea to treat to my wounds. If they find out I am running about on new missions...!"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"I have to catch her! Curses, why does she have to be so fast!?
