Journey to the Coerthas western highlands and find the knight commanding the operation.","The knights in Hemlock find themselves locked in a heated battle with a pack of terrible winged creatures. Without aid for their injured companions, that battle will surely be lost.","It appears more knights require Aspected Benefic.","It appears still more knights require Aspected Benefic.","A knight you heal claims he heard a woman scream nearby. Hurry to see if Leveva is unhurt.","You rescue Leveva and Jannequinard from several hungry creatures, only to have your warm reunion cut short by the arrival of Sevestre─the high-ranking Sharlayan official who hired Celie to capture Leveva. Sevestre has detained Leveva's ailing grandfather and tells her that if she wishes him released, she must return with him to the Old World.","Leveva has gleaned from her father's journal that Sevestre was the mastermind behind Rufin's murder. Apparently, the Bibliothecs' leader sought to make the assassination look like an Ishgardian attack in order to strengthen his argument for abandoning Eorzea. Unfortunately, the journal─and the evidence it contains─now lies in the hands of he whom it would condemn. Jannequinard wishes to return to Ishgard so that you may discuss your options, but you should first report to the House Durendaire knight captain and see if he has further need of your services.","The knight thanks you for your assistance and has nothing but praise for your efforts. You may now return to Ishgard with Jannequinard, Quimperain, and Leveva.","Leveva has decided to surrender herself to Sevestre and quietly return with the man to Sharlayan so that no harm may come to her grandfather and mother. Jannequinard has agreed to escort her to the abandoned Sharlayan city–state in the Dravanian hinterlands, despite the fact his life may also be in danger.<br><br>※The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 60."],"objectives":["Speak with the knight captain in Hemlock.","Cast Aspected Benefic on the wounded knights.","Keep casting Aspected Benefic on the wounded knights.","Why aren't you still casting Aspected Benefic on wounded knights?","Rescue Leveva and Jannequinard.","Speak with Jannequinard.","Speak with the knight captain.","Speak with Jannequinard in Ishgard."],"dialogue":[{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"Word of Lady Leveva's charity has begun spreading, my friend. I have attended more than one luncheon where it was positively dripping off the tongues of all the good lords and ladies. And the knights? Oh, the knights. They have started rumbling about why magicks that not only heal the wounded, but also enhance the strengths of the healthy are not being employed to save the lives of those on the front lines."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"Needless to say, the Vault is not amused. Their plan to have us fade into obscurity has rebounded upon them, and now they are scrambling to twist this situation to their advantage."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"Listen, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. The Vault would have us officially attend an operation currently underway in the western highlands village of Hemlock. The settlement was abandoned after the Calamity, and has since been overrun with beasts of all manner. The Holy See seeks to reclaim it, and my uncle, the count, has generously volunteered his knights to clear the area of any remaining threats."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"It is win-win for the Vault. The operation is small enough and far enough away from the capital that even if it is a success, no one will pay it half a mind, but the Vault will be able to say that they answered the pleas of the knights. If, for any reason, the operation were to fail, then the Vault would be able to attribute the failure to the astrologian presence, and turn the High Houses against Lady Leveva."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"Dammy"},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"I spoke with the lady about this, but she said she was not interested in the politics of the situation, only that it was her duty to aid people in need. We should speak with her, and soon. Let us make haste to Hemlock."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"Reports from Hemlock claim the village is a veritable den of feathered dragons─the few remaining homes naught more than gutted shells. When we arrive, we should seek the commanding officer and have him direct us to our young charge."},{"name":"DOORHEMLOCK","text":"You here to help with the operation? Word has it the battle has taken a turn for the worse..."},{"name":"Q1","text":"Enter Hemlock?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Yes"},{"name":"A1","text":"No"},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"So this is battle... I... I never knew... All the blood..."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"There are wounded everywhere, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! We must help them!"},{"name":"QUIMPERAIN","text":"What I lack in healing talents, I shall make up for with my blade."},{"name":"CAPTAIN02024","text":"We severely underestimated the strength of our enemies, and now my men and women find themselves overwhelmed. The tight wedges we had at the day's onset have all degraded into small knots of fighting, and the number of wounded is growing faster than our chaplains can heal them. Thank the Fury you arrived when you did."},{"name":"CAPTAIN02024","text":"Our wounded hide in the lee of yonder boulders for we have not even the means to pull their ailing bodies to safety."},{"name":"WOUNDEDA02024","text":"It's so dark... Why is it so dark? Weren't we fighting during the day...?"},{"name":"WOUNDEDA02024","text":"Where am I? Where is my company? I must return to them!"},{"name":"WOUNDEDB02024","text":"There are others...with wounds still deeper than mine..."},{"name":"WOUNDEDB02024","text":"Please... Help..."},{"name":"WOUNDEDB02024","text":"I shan't forget this, astrologian. I am forever in your debt."},{"name":"WOUNDEDB02024","text":"There are others...with wounds still deeper than mine..."},{"name":"WOUNDEDC02024","text":"I once heard that at the end...your life flashes before your eyes... Why is it, then, I can only recall the bodice of that wench at the Forgotten Knight...?"},{"name":"WOUNDEDC02024","text":"You have my thanks, but there must still be many who require succor."},{"name":"WOUNDEDC02024","text":"I heard a woman's scream beyond this very boulder not moments before you arrived."},{"name":"WOUNDEDC02024","text":"I did not recognize the voice. Could it have been one of your companions?"},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"They descended from the mountains. We barely had time to draw our globes..."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"My arm was bit and my deck scattered. I do not think I can be of any assistance, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. You must forgive me..."},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"(-Robed Astrologian-)What have we here?"},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"Sevestre? You who vowed never to set foot in this barbarian land again? Unless..."},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"Clever girl. Yes, it was I who hired Celie to bring you back to Sharlayan. And if you had come back with us quietly, you would be free right now, rather than a wanted criminal facing a trial, imprisonment, even execution...depending on what you have told these tamed savages of yours. Yes, my dear. I offered you a chance, and you foolishly refused it. The edict has been issued. And I am here to collect you."},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"Though, I must place some of the blame for that on our friend Celie. Had she not insisted on playing games, perhaps you would have displayed reason back in the Black Shroud. Instead, she merely added fuel to a fire already hot with your inherent stubbornness."},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"And now I am forced to make the journey to this filthy realm to clean up her mess. And I suppose that starts with these companions of yours."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Take Jannequinard and leave... Right now. Neither of you are ready for magicks of the variety he wields."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"But what of you, my lady!?"},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"I am going to reclaim my father's journal!"},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"Brave. Your father was brave. Your father is also dead."},{"name":"QUIMPERAIN","text":"Lady Leveva!"},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"Ah, I now understand Celie's frustration. This realm is truly overrun with vermin. How we suffered here for so long, I will never know. Very well, Leveva. You leave me no choice."},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"You may already know we have questioned Mace regarding your unauthorized passage into Eorzea. What you may <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> know, is that we still hold him...in the Dark Cells. Just as a precautionary measure, of course. We would not want to see him flee again before the trial."},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"Now, your grandfather is not as spry as he used to be, and I am uncertain how long the sanity a man of his age will last in complete darkness. Though, the longer you delay, the closer we come to finding out."},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"If you wish to see your grandfather released, you will come to the abandoned city in the Dravanian hinterlands. There, my airship will be waiting to take you back to the Old World where you will be tried. Fairly, of course."},{"name":"SEVESTRE","text":"I suppose you could run, but know that doing so would have grave consequences for your grandfather, and possibly your mother, as well. And, we would still eventually find you."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"Wait! My father's diary!"},{"name":"QUIMPERAIN","text":"He may still be close. Wait here!"},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"Sevestre... I knew it..."},{"name":"CAPTAIN02024","text":"I see you were forced to join the fighting as well. Luckily, your arrival provided us with just enough momentum to drive back the beasts."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"Lady Leveva, who was that? I have the strangest feeling I should know him from somewhere..."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"Sevestre─leader of the Bibliothecs─a powerful group of conservative fundamentalists who seek to control the whole of Sharlayan's knowledge. They believe that our people should not become involved in history, only be witness to it. Then analyze it until all the lives lived and lost are but numbers on a page."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"You may remember Sevestre, Jannequinard, because he is the selfsame man who has pushed for old Sharlayan to batten its doors...and has used my father's death as his rallying cry."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"And now I am certain that he had my father killed."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"Near the end of my father's diary, he mentions being contacted by a young Sevestre, who happened to be an older classmate of his when they were both at the Studium. Sevestre, looking to make a name for himself as a politician, warned my father against continuing to disseminate knowledge of Sharlayan astrology in Eorzea. A warning my father, of course, did not heed."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"Soon after, several attempts were made upon my father's life. When he subsequently looked into the matter, he discovered that there was a price on his head...and that Sevestre had put it there. I discovered a contract signed by the wretch folded in my father's journal. He had planned on revealing it to the Forum on his return... But he never had the chance."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"Jannequinard. My father gave you that journal before he died...but you never once opened it?"},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"I did not think it was mine to read... But what you say... If it is true... We must get that diary back. Come, it seems the fighting has died down. Let us report to the captain of the knights, then return to Ishgard so that we may plan our next move."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"I do not know what to believe anymore... We must report to the captain and then hasten back to Ishgard. Perhaps then we can attempt to make sense of all that has befallen us here today."},{"name":"CAPTAIN02024","text":"Many lives were saved because of you. If this is what we can expect from Sharlayan astrology, I see no reason why we shouldn't have knights trained in the field. I will recommend this to the lord commander. I suspect he will be pleased to see the day won with so few casualties."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"If you require our services again, you need only ask. Come, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Let us hasten back to Ishgard."},{"name":"CAPTAIN02024","text":"I applaud you and your companions on a battle well fought. We knights do not forget the bravery shown by our allies."},{"name":"DOORHEMLOCK","text":"Will you be returning now, astrologian?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"Leave Hemlock?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Yes"},{"name":"A2","text":"No"},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"Moments ago, we received a missive from the commander of my father's guard. He thanked us again for our assistance in Hemlock, and has formally requested that Lady Leveva train several of his knights in Sharlayan astrology."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"The Vault, however, remains silent, and I believe this silence to be calculated. If the edict issued for Lady Leveva's extradition has arrived, they need only turn a blind eye to Sevestre's actions, until he has spirited the lady from the realm...and people simply forget she was ever here."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"But we are not going to let that happen...are we, my lady?"},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"I am sorry, Jannequinard, but I no longer see how we cannot."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"Sevestre has my grandfather, he has threatened to take my mother, and he now has the one thing that could have saved them both─my father's journal."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"No, Jannequinard. I cannot deny my fate any longer. I have done several readings since our return, and every one is the same. Deceit... Manipulation... Submission... My path is clear. You, however, can carry on. Sevestre has no authority over you, or you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. See that my father's dream is fulfilled... Promise me that much."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"I shall promise you that and more, my lady. Quimperain and I will see you to the place of meeting, and do whatever possible to make certain this Sevestre keeps his word."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"You know that by attending me, you put yourself in danger. He has shown he will not hesitate to kill anyone who stands in his way. And now that he knows <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> know of his involvement in my father's death... But still you would stand by my side in my last moments in Eorzea. I do not deserve friends such as you..."},{"name":"LEVEVA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Aether is the building block of all that surrounds us, meaning that everything is connected. Someone closely attuned with that aether can, in a sense, link themselves with others, feeling their joy, feeling their pain. Scholars of the soul call this empathy. Crystal-gazers and card-readers call it the wheel of fortune. We astrologians call it collective unconsciousness. Whatever you call it, I feel that bond with you. Both of you.
