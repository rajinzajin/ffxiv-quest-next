Cerigg sent him for a stroll around town to see if it might help to jog his memories, and encourages you to check in on him. Track down Taynor and see if he has met with any success in piecing together his past.","You and Cerigg speak further with Taynor, who unfortunately can still recall nothing of where he came from. Cerigg further explains that according to the carer who examined him, the boy apparently possesses considerable magical powers. Drawing the conclusion that he doubtless has a master or tutor somewhere out there, the bounty hunter proposes speaking with a traveling merchant in town to see if anything might be gleaned as to your young friend's origins.","The merchant tells of something he overheard when sojourning at the Inn at Journey's Head─that of an ill-fated mage who was attacked by a sin eater and was separated from his child in the process. Believing that this could very well be Taynor's father, the three of you resolve to make for the Inn and investigate further.","You arrive at the Inn to learn that the son of the wounded mage has already been found─the man was not Taynor's father after all. The kindly boy offers to show Taynor around the premises in hopes of further rekindling his memories. Once the boy is gone, Cerigg, dismayed at the unfortunate turn of events, proposes entrusting Taynor to the care of another so that the two of you might return to hunting Phronesis─and continue the search for Taynor's family in the process. Cerigg offers to break the news to the unfortunate child himself, and you agree to accompany him.","Events have taken yet another distressing turn, as Taynor is nowhere to be found. As it happens, your young charge got into a heated quarrel with the other boy, and subsequently dashed off on his own to the gods know where. Together with Cerigg, you make for the Fields of Amber, that you might track down Taynor before he comes to harm.","Arriving in the Fields of Amber, you find Taynor under attack by nasty-looking sin eaters. Vanquish the fiends before they devour the poor, frightened child.","You successfully dispatch the sin eaters and rescue Taynor from harm. In the aftermath of the battle, you are granted a vision of Taynor's past through the power of the Echo. There, you see that the boy was a young mage training under the same teacher as Nyelbert, one of the erstwhile Warriors of Light who now roams the area as the baleful Phronesis. Understandably perplexed by these recent developments, Cerigg proposes a return to the Inn at Journey's Head, where you might discuss matters further in safer environs.","Back at the Inn, Taynor and the other boy apologize to each other and make their peace, and the latter departs for his new home at the Crystarium. The remaining three of you make plans to return to Mord Souq, where you might think over the knowledge you have recently gleaned and unravel the mysteries behind the enigmatic child's past.","Back at Mord Souq, Cerigg explains to Taynor that, as bizarre as it may sound, the events of his memory must have taken place over one hundred years ago. Convinced now that your young companion is the key to vanquishing the dread Phronesis, Cerigg has a change of heart and proposes that the two of you officially take him in. Taynor welcomes the offer, thanking the two of you profusely for your kindness and promising that he will lend you whatever aid he can. For your part, you resolve to further hone your command of the magical arts while waiting for the lad's memories to recover further.<br><br>※The next role quest will be available from Cerigg upon reaching level 76 in any magical ranged DPS class."],"objectives":["Speak with Taynor.","Speak with the savvy merchant.","Speak with a carer at the Inn at Journey's Head.","Speak with Cerigg.","Search for Taynor.","Rescue Taynor.","Speak with the forlorn boy.","Speak with Cerigg at Mord Souq."],"dialogue":[{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Ah, there you are. You'll be happy to know that the boy is awake, and seems to be no worse for the wear. Physically speaking, at least..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"There's just one rub, you see. He has no recollection of where he came from, or just how he managed to get swallowed up into the void."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"In fact, other than his own name─Taynor─he can't remember much of anything at all."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"He seems a good lad, mind you─eats my half-arsed cooking with a smile and nary a word of complaint. Yet I reckon he's hurting inside, and badly. We must reunite him with his parents with all due speed."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I suggested that he go for a stroll around Mord Souq, in the hopes that the sights might help to jog his memories. He can't have wandered far─why don't you go check up on him?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I realize this is something of a detour, but we simply can't leave a poor amnesic orphan to fend for himself, now can we? Let's find the boy a safe home as soon as we can."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"Do not tell me...you are the one who rescued me from the flow, yes? I feel from you the same warmth that reached out to me when I was adrift in the aether."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Well, I'll be damned. The boy's a sharp one."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"And that's not the least of it. The carer who examined him said they could feel great power welling up from within him. Despite his young age, Taynor here seems to possess a remarkable command of the magical arts."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"Perhaps I do, and yet...I cannot say. Try as I might, I can recall nothing of who I am, or where I came from. Only the darkness..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"No need for apologies, boy. You did well just to make it back to us. Speaking of which, can you remember anything at all of what you felt when you were adrift in the void?"},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"That I remember...or at least I think I do. I recall a vague sensation of someone passing alongside me. Indeed, I believe this is what roused me from my slumber."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Hmm... If the hollows truly are a gate between worlds, that would mean that someone recently traveled from ours to another─or from another to ours... But that's not possible...or is it?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You'd be surprised..."},{"name":"A2","text":"Don't be ridiculous."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"You know something I don't, friend? Worry not─I won't pry for details."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"That's what I thought. Fair enough. Then again, traveling between worlds isn't exactly my area of expertise..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Ah, well. No sense racking our brains over matters beyond our comprehension. Let's concentrate on what we <span class=\"emphasis\">can</span> do─namely, finding the boy here a home. No doubt his memories will come back to him in due time."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"You'd truly do that? For me? But the two of you have already saved my life. I couldn't possibly burden you any further..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Hah, it's no burden at all! Besides, if we can figure out just who you are─and where you came from─it just might lead us to the answers we seek."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Now, let's consider the options. One possibility is that you're an orphan─all alone in this world, with not a soul to care for or look after you."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"And yet, this seems unlikely. Yes, the mystical powers you possess say otherwise. If you are truly as skilled in magic as they say, then it stands to reason that someone trained you in the art."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Who this master of yours is─and whether you are of their blood, or simply received their tutelage─this I cannot say. But either way, I'm certain they're worried sick about you."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"If that truly is so...I would very much like to meet this person, too."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"That settles it, then─let's get down to business. I took the liberty of inquiring around Mord Souq and the Crystarium. Unfortunately, there have been no reports of missing persons matching Taynor's description."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Which means that we have no choice but to take our search elsewhere. I know of a merchant in town whose travels often take him far afield. Let us have a talk with him and see if he's heard any helpful rumors."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Impressive how Taynor's managed to keep himself together, eh? The boy's mature beyond his years, no doubt."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"The two of you are far too kind. I cannot thank you enough..."},{"name":"TRAVELINGMERCHANT03625","text":"Rumors of a missing boy, you say? Funny that you ask. It's a long shot, I reckon, but I overheard something the other day that might be of use."},{"name":"TRAVELINGMERCHANT03625","text":"On my way to Mord Souq, I stopped over at the Inn at Journey's Head. There, I met an ailing mage. As the carers told it, he'd been ambushed by a sin eater, and was separated from his child in the battle."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Bloody hells...could it be!? If the sin eater that attacked the poor man was Phronesis, that would explain everything!"},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"This man you speak of...he could be my father? We must go to him at once!"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Agreed. I only hope that the man is...no, there is no point in presuming the worst. Let us make for the Inn, and see what the carers there can tell us."},{"name":"TRAVELINGMERCHANT03625","text":"The man was in rough shape, I fear. For the child's sake, I hope he's doing better than when I last saw him..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I just hope whatever we find here puts a smile on the poor boy's face."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"My father is here? But this place is..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Ho there! I hear there's a mage in your care who's lost his boy. Well, I do believe we have him right here!"},{"name":"NURSE03625","text":"Hm? I fear there must be some mistake. The boy in question has already been found. This is him...right here."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"What...!? So it wasn't my father after all...?"},{"name":"NURSE03625","text":"This boy with you...he, too, has been separated from his family?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Just so. We heard that a man here was looking for his son, and we just hoped...alas, it seems it wasn't meant to be."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"But there are many people here, yes? Might I ask around and see if any of the others are my family?"},{"name":"NURSE03625","text":"But of course. Yet many of the people here are quite ill, and in many cases, in considerable pain. It is not a place for a young child to walk around unattended."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Indeed it's not. Guess that means either myself or <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> here should accompany him..."},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"I'll go with him. The walk might help me, er, take my mind off things."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Not a bad idea, if the lad doesn't mind. I reckon Taynor would rather be with someone of his own age."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Take his mind off things...? Speaking of which, how is the boy's father holding up?"},{"name":"NURSE03625","text":"I fear the poor man has already departed on his journey. He is a man no longer."},{"name":"NURSE03625","text":"The child insisted upon staying by his father's side until the last. I permitted this out of respect for him, though part of me regrets the choice. None so young should suffer such horrors."},{"name":"NURSE03625","text":"It was some small solace to learn that he has living relatives who reside at the Crystarium. In fact, I was just making preparations to escort him there myself."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"...I see. Reckon we should also find someone to look after Taynor as well."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Don't get me wrong, friend─I haven't given up on the prospect of finding the boy's family. But we have no other leads, and a deadly sin eater still on the loose."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"If the lad tags along with us every step of the way, he's far more likely to end up dead or worse than to ever reunite with his family."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Here's what I propose: we find someone to watch after Taynor for the time being, get back on the hunt, and gather whatever clues we can about his origins along the way."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Is there not more we can do?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Very well. But we must see that he is safe."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I, too, wish there was more we could do for the lad. But think of it this way─if we don't do something about that damned sin eater, who knows how many poor children will end up like Taynor?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Aye, that goes without saying. Let us have a talk with the proprietor of the Wandering Stairs. He's a kindly enough chap, and knows damn near everyone in these parts. With any luck, he'll be able to direct us to a willing and able guardian."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Look, I don't like this any more than you do. But it's the best we can do for the boy given our circumstances. At any rate, let's find him and share the news. Don't worry: it's my decision, and I intend to take responsibility for it."},{"name":"NURSE03625","text":"Forgive me, my friends. I wish there was more we could do for the child, but our resources are already stretched terribly thin. I wish you luck in finding his family."},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"I...I'm sorry! I-It's all my fault..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Bad news, friend. It seems the two young ones got into a quarrel of sorts, and Taynor's up and run away."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Seems the lad mentioned how he'd come out from one of the hollows. The other boy put two and two together and figured he'd been attacked by a sin eater."},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"Then I said...I said...my dad was attacked by a sin eater, and then he turned into one himself. So I asked...what if...what if you turn into a sin eater too?"},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"Taynor's face went all white. He kept saying, “What do you mean? What do you mean?”─over, and over, and over again. I just...I couldn't take it anymore."},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"Before I knew it, I was shouting at him, “Shut up! Just shut up! I bet you're turning into a sin eater already!” Why? Why did I say such a mean and nasty thing!?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Don't be so hard on yourself, lad. Both of you have had a rough go of it these past few days. Nobody could blame either one of you for feeling a bit on edge."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"But we must hurry and find Taynor before he comes to harm. Let's split up: I'll search to the west, and you take the east. And be careful out there!"},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"You'll bring Taynor back, won't you? I just...I just want to tell him I'm sorry."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"When I heard the clamor of battle, I feared the worst, but I see that you have everything under control. Are you okay, lad?"},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"F-Forgive me... I...I don't deserve this kindness."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"I...I was just so scared. I was worried about what would become of me if I never recovered my memories, and then I started thinking, what if I ended up like that boy's father? What if it's already happening to me...?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"That's one matter you needn't worry yourself with. The carer who examined you told me as much. You suffered no direct wounds─you're in no more danger of turning into a sin eater than <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> or me."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"Is...is that so. That's good to hear. But I...I must apologize to that boy. I should have known better than to badger him about such things...especially after what happened to his father."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Funny thing, that─he was saying the same thing about you. You both have good hearts, lad─and you've been through more than any man should. There's no need to be ashamed about your feelings."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"There is...still so much I do not understand about this world. Why does no one here know of me? Am I doomed to be alone for the rest of my days?"},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"Why...why must it be this way!? If only I could remember something...<span class=\"emphasis\">anything</span>! I'm sick of not knowing who I am! I'm sick of being alone!"},{"name":"MAGELEADER","text":"Now it's your turn, Taynor. And do not be disheartened by your last attempt─even the greatest of mages have known failure."},{"name":"NYELBERT","text":"(-Bright Boy-)Your command of magic is the equal of my own. If I can succeed, there is no reason why you cannot. Free your mind of worry, and focus."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"Thank you, Nyelbert. I shall try my best."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Wicked white! Are you all right, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!?"},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"...I remember now. I was standing here on these blighted plains, my head hung low in shame. Then, Nyelbert turned to me with a smile and heartening words..."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"Nyelbert... Why does the name sound so familiar?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I reckon we've much to discuss, but not in this godsforsaken place. Let's head back to the Inn and see if we can't get to the bottom of this."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"I do hope he'll forgive me..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"We have much to discuss, but first, we should let the two boys make their peace."},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"Taynor! Are you all right!? I'm so sorry... I shouldn't have said those nasty things..."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"Forgive me for reacting as I did. I'm...I'm fine. In fact, I seem to have recovered some of my memories..."},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"Really!? That's wonderful! Maybe...maybe you won't feel so scared and alone anymore."},{"name":"SHADOWYBOY03625","text":"I'm leaving to go live in the Crystarium with my relatives. Promise me you'll come visit? I mean, after you get your memories back and all, of course..."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"It's a promise. Until next time, my friend."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I knew that you two would work things out. Now, let us return to Mord Souq. We have more than our share of questions that need answering."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"I cannot help but feel I also made a promise to that boy in my memories... Nyelbert, was it?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"As I saw it, first you fainted all of a sudden. When you came to, a portion of Taynor's memories had returned. What in the world happened out there?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"The power to look into the past, eh?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"And you're certain that what <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> described matches up with your recollection of the past?"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I don't know how to break this to you, lad, but...your friend Nyelbert that was with you that day? He's no ordinary boy."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"He's none other than the very man who became Phronesis─one of those godsdamned Warriors of Light. If he was just a young child in your memories, that means that what you saw took place over one hundred years ago!"},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Would that it were just a coincidence─another boy with the same name. But no, judging from the formidable command of magic...we can only assume it was him."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"On the way back, I managed to recall some more...about Nyelbert and myself."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"We were taken in by a group of mages...a consortium of sorts. They were searching for a means to open a hole to another world, and were recruiting young children with high magical aptitude for the task. Nyelbert and myself were the two they chose..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"You can't be serious! And yet, that would explain the sin eater's ability to summon those damned hollows..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"And if you possess the same knowledge and training as Nyelbert did, it could also explain why you were able to survive in there all that time. But what I don't understand is...why haven't you aged at all?"},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"I cannot say for sure. And yet my memories...they are slowly coming back to me. In time, I may be able to help you find a way to close the hollows."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"You'd be a lifesaver if you could. But don't overburden yourself─you're still recovering, after all. In the meantime, don't worry: <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and I will see that you're safe."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I'd thought Taynor was just a victim of the sin eater. To think he was actually <span class=\"emphasis\">friends</span> with the man himself...er, back when he was still a man. This can't be simple coincidence."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Yes, I'm convinced of it now─the child holds the key to defeating Phronesis. We must keep him safe, and not let him out of our sights."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Besides, look at how hard he's trying to recover his memories. I'm not so heartless as to kick the poor lad aside before he's figured matters out."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"But we can't very well rush things. You and I will continue to prepare for the battle ahead, while waiting for the rest of Taynor's memories to come back to him..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Ah, that is to say...if it's all right with you, lad?"},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"I...I'm so sorry. I couldn't possibly burden you any further..."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Look, lad. I've only known you a short while, but I can tell you've a good heart, and a good head on your shoulders."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"I can only begin to imagine the horrors you've been through, not to mention the fears and uncertainty you face even now."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"But I want you to promise me this: no more apologies. You're no burden to us, not in the least. You're a valuable member of our band, and as long as you're willing, I want you with us. Isn't that right, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"I...I see."},{"name":"TAYNOR","text":"Thank you, Cerigg. Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I will aid your quest in whatever way I can."},{"name":"CERIGG","text":"Now that's more like it.
