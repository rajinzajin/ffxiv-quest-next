Form the mudra for heaven, or Ten, then unleash the technique and channel the energy forth as a flaming projectile. As your first task, demonstrate the technique for Oboro on the mokujin, or training dummy, that has been set up outside the dock storehouse.","Your Fuma Shuriken strikes the mokujin true. Speak with Oboro to hear his evaluation of your technique.","Oboro deems you ready for the next phase of your training, which will pit you against live opponents. Prepare yourself as necessary, then speak with him when you are ready to do battle.","By holding your own against Oboro and his summoned minions, you have passed your latest test with flying colors. Speak with Oboro, who is doubtless pleased with your efforts.","Oboro and Tsubame are most impressed at the swiftness with which you have mastered your first mudra. In return for the lesson you received, you instruct the Domans in the finer points of the Eorzean bow, a gesture that─despite its seeming simplicity─does not come easily to Oboro. He encourages you to continue to hone your technique until you are ready to receive your next lesson.<br><br>※The next ninja quest will be available from Tsubame upon reaching level 35."],"objectives":["Use Fuma Shuriken on the mokujin.","Report to Oboro.","Speak with Oboro to begin your training.","Speak with Oboro."],"dialogue":[{"name":"OBORO","text":"Yes... I can sense it. Though you are not of our blood, the soul of my people is strong in you. You are one of us now, a shinobi."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"...And yet your training has only just begun."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Heed my words well, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. For the shinobi, blade and mind are one. The weak mind gives rise to a weak blade. The false mind gives rise to a false blade. But the mind that is strong and true? That blade will know no equal."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Such were the teachings of my master, his master, and his master's master before him. The shinobi must keep presence of mind at all times, or his blade may as well be one of grass."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"That is the lesson of the mind. Now we shall begin the lesson of the body."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You will recall that the art of ninjutsu involves using hand gestures called mudra to summon the energies of heaven, earth, and man─<span class=\"emphasis\">Ten</span>, <span class=\"emphasis\">Chi</span>, and <span class=\"emphasis\">Jin</span> in the Doman tongue."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Myriad techniques can be unleashed depending on the mudra you combine, and the order in which you do so... But perhaps I am getting ahead of myself. A child must learn to walk before he can run."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"To begin, I would see you master your first mudra─Ten, the mudra of heaven. Summon the energy of heaven and project it forth, and from your hand will fly a flaming star, or Fuma Shuriken."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Outside of the storehouse, you will find a <span class=\"emphasis\">mokujin</span>─a wooden man of the sort traditionally used in Doma for training. Do as I have told you and strike it with a Fuma Shuriken. I will observe your technique from a distance."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Form the mudra Ten to summon the energy of heaven, then channel it from your hands in the form of a Fuma Shuriken to strike the mokujin. I will observe your technique from a distance."},{"name":"TSUBAME","text":"The art of ninjutsu is easily learned, but not so easily mastered. Be patient, and heed well Oboro's words."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"A training manikin of Far Eastern make has been set in the ground."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Yes, that will do, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Clearly we did not misjudge your potential."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"Perhaps you have also felt your body becoming lighter. This is but another benefit of your training. You may find yourself able to dance through the air with your blades drawn. But be mindful: the true shinobi sees that no movement is wasted."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You demonstrated your skills well against the wooden man, but wood does not strike back. Your next opponent will not be so docile. Prepare yourself."},{"name":"TSUBAME","text":"Beneath that dour expression, I know that Oboro finds you a worthy student. But do not think for a moment that he will hold back his strength."},{"name":"TSUBAME","text":"Your aptitude for our art is nothing short of astounding, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. The soul of our ancestors chose wisely, indeed."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"...I see. Lady Yugiri spoke true."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"...I see."},{"name":"TSUBAME","text":"What Oboro means to say is that he's not seen anyone master the fundamentals of ninjutsu with such swiftness. Is that not so, Oboro?"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"I am capable of speaking for myself, Tsubame. But it is true: <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> has exceeded even my own expectations. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Her</span><span class=\"alternative\">His</span></span> blade slices through the air as a fish glides through water."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"But that is enough training for the day. Now, it is my turn to be the student, and you the teacher. I would learn the ways of Eorzea. You will instruct me, yes?"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"You have my gratitude, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"First, I would better know the terrain of La Nosc─hm? Is something amusing?"},{"name":"OBORO","text":"My <span class=\"emphasis\">bow</span>!? I see. Who would have thought a simple gesture of courtesy would be so complicated? Like this, is it? &lt;cough&gt; Urk..."},{"name":"TSUBAME","text":"Forgive him. Oboro has not been quite himself since coming to these shores. It would seem that neither the food nor the climate agrees with him."},{"name":"OBORO","text":"And let us not forget the stink of those infernal horsebirds! All the more reason for us to complete our mission swiftly and return to more hospitable environs. Anyhow, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, that should suffice for the day. Practice well your ninjutsu, and return when you are ready for your next lesson."},{"name":"TSUBAME","text":"It would seem you have some practicing to do as well."},{"name":"QIB","text":"Defeat the onibi!"},{"name":"QIB","text":"Defeat the ogama and onibi!"},{"name":"QIB","text":"Defeat Oboro!"},{"name":"QIB","text":"The onibi will attack in waves.
