This observation is reaffirmed by Jammingway, who estimates your café may even be as well-patronized as Sharlayan's famous Last Stand. Wishing to be certain, the management team heads on-site to confirm.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","You arrive at the Nekropolis to find that the Last Dregs is doing well─a little <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> well, in fact. With no objectives left to achieve in order for the café to be considered a success, N-7000 asserts that it has no choice but to consider its mission accomplished and enter permanent hibernation for maximum efficiency. Jammingway is, of course, hopping mad about their business partner's imminent demise, but the Omicron is either unwilling or unable to be talked out of its protocols at present, and heads for Base Omicron despite their protests. Uncertain of what to do, yet knowing you must do something, you elect to pursue it.","You make your way to Base Omicron without trouble, but N-7000 is nowhere to be seen. According to the local Omicrons that kindly scan the relevant data for you, it proceeded through the fallow portal. It has also been checking Sir's logs...","You find N-7000 at the long-dead Tree of Life, where apparently the mysterious Sir also came to ruminate while operating as M-017. Though it has yet to find a way around the logic of its inevitable shutdown, it is clear that it would if it could. You remind it that its existence, in some ways, is already an impossibility, which at last spurs it to consider the idea that its potential is not bound by petty scientific laws. Alas, the resulting epiphany is so engaging that it immediately overclocks its processors and becomes lost in multi-sim mode, which appears liable to cause a meltdown any moment now.","Unsure of how to break your Omicron ally from its aggressive cogitation, you return to Jammingway, who proposes that you do what the Last Dregs does best─feed your target whether they like it or not. Suggesting that Stigma-4's knowledge of Omicron dietary needs may be preferable to your almost complete ignorance, Jammingway runs off to call upon the logistics matrix.","Stigma-4 indicates that Omicrons take their sustenance in liquid form, with coolant being vital to their maintenance. What is more, the logic matrix suggests your intervention may prove the necessary impetus to bring about the change in dynamis that<br>N-7000 clearly desires. With data about an ingredient that may be of use in refrigerant in mind, you make for what may generously be termed the “wilds” of Ultima Thule.","You deliver your precious refrigerant matter to Jammingway at the Last Dregs. Stigma-4 has helpfully collected N-7000's immobilized carapace in the meantime, so you need only sit back and watch as the unit is forcibly rebooted. Your respite is not long for this world, however, as upon waking it almost immediately says something incomprehensible and rushes off in the direction of A-4 Research.","In pursuit of N-7000 for the second time in recent memory, you find yourself in Elysion, where a strange-yet-beautiful forest has sprung from the unit's newly affirmed belief in myriad possibilities. It vows to continue running the café in the name of all that has not yet been, but could be, in hopes of a more meaningful future for the Omicron civilization. You spend a joyous time picnicking with your fellow Last Dregs managers in celebration, though it is not long until the unlikely business partners are once again at loggerheads. On and on they shall go, you imagine, unto the very end of the universe─and perhaps beyond."],"objectives":["Speak with Jammingway.","Gather information at Base Omicron.","Speak with N-7000.","Speak with Jammingway.","Wait at the destination.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mine [Error] east of the abode of the Ea</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver [Error] to Jammingway</span><span class=\"alternative\">Gather [Error] southeast of the abode of the Ea</span><span class=\"alternative\">Catch [Error] at the abode of the Ea</span></span>.","Speak with Jammingway in A-4 Research."],"dialogue":[{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; Reports from behind the counter indicate that dragons have achieved social integration with other customers.
