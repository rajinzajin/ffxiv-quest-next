Beyond the Gates of Judgement lie the Steps of Faith─a great bridge of stone that leads directly to the city of Ishgard."},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"More than simply a means to cross the Sea of Clouds, the bridge serves as a foundation for the arcane wards that form the barrier we call Daniffen's Collar."},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"Alas, in dispelling the barrier's outermost layer, that thrice-damned witch Iceheart stripped the bridge of its protection, and thus are the dragons now able to land unhindered upon the Steps of Faith."},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"Should the Dravanians succeed in destroying the remainder of the wards, the winged devils will be free to swarm within the city itself."},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"Needless to say, we cannot suffer that to happen. It shall be our task as defenders to prevent any harm from coming to those parts of the bridge wherein the wards are sealed."},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"All now rests on us, adventurer. Lead your comrades out onto the Steps of Faith and prepare to meet the Horde. ...May the Fury guide your blades!"},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"If the Steps of Faith fall, so too shall Ishgard. We must defend them to the last man."},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"Rally your comrades, adventurer, and join us in our stand against the Horde!"},{"name":"HEISHI","text":"(-Ishgardian Knight-)The dragons─ They are withdrawing! Victory is ours!"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"One of Nidhogg's greatest champions...slain. The Horde will not soon recover from this blow."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But what of you, Nidhogg? Why did you not join your minions and make of this battle a slaughter? Have you grown so fond of the stench of your lair?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Mayhap you prefer to have your allies fight your battles for you... You have a girl to do your bidding now, do you not? No matter. I shall slay Iceheart, and all the rest..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"...But I yearn to spill the blood of a great wyrm, Nidhogg, and only your death will sate my lance."},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"By the Fury... You have driven the Horde from the Steps of Faith! You! A stranger to our land! I confess, I did not think you capable of such a feat..."},{"name":"MARCELAIN","text":"Yet you yielded not an ilm in the face of dragons that would turn my brother knights' blood to ice. The Fury Herself must walk at your side!"},{"name":"CHAUNOLLET","text":"Nay, I'll not deny it: without your skill and fortitude, the city would now be ash. Would that more of your adventuring brethren possessed such qualities."},{"name":"LOANNE","text":"You have served us well, adventurer─the Temple Knights would have been hard-pressed indeed to turn back the Horde alone. Mayhap 'tis time I returned to the practice yard..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! The dragons are routed! Lest you wonder, the fighting at the Steel Vigil was also fierce, but my Crystal Braves were not found wanting!"},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"Commander Leveilleur, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>... True to your word, you arrived to aid us in our hour of need."},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"On behalf of the Holy See and the people of Ishgard, I offer you my humble thanks."},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"Though I would stay and lavish you with well-deserved praise, I fear I must away to oversee the aftermath of the siege. Not all the dragons are fled, and there are yet wounded to be carried from the field. Pray let us meet anon that I might express my thanks with the proper courtesy."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I too would offer my thanks, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Through your deeds, we have achieved a victory of singular importance."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"With the Dravanian Horde thus weakened and scattered, the threat to Ishgard has been greatly diminished."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And, mayhap equally significant, the Holy See must now recognize the necessity of cooperation with foreign powers."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Long have they barred their gates against the outside world, but I am confident that the day will soon come when Ishgard proclaims itself a member of the Eorzean Alliance once more."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Much have we sacrificed in our struggles against dragons and primals, the Ascians and the Empire. But, step by unfaltering step, we march ever nearer to our goal."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And, as ever, the journey is made with you in the van."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The victory you have won this day gives us greater hope for the morrow."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"'Tis a hope that shall sustain us in the days to come, and bear us past the many evils that yet seek to hinder our progress.<br>Yes, we have done well, my friend, and I, for one, would take a moment to savor the enormity of our achievement!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...The demands of duty, however, allow me little time for levity. I must accompany Captain Ilberd back to Ul'dah, and reassign those Braves whose squads suffered heavy losses."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"You, my friend, have earned a rest at the Rising Stones. Pray return to Revenant's Toll, and share your tale with Minfilia in person."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Welcome back!"},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Alphinaud sent word of the siege.
