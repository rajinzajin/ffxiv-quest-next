There should be four heretics there. Find them and eliminate them.","You have found and killed all four heretics reported as taking refuge within Hemlock. Report back to Redwald that this insidious threat has been dealt with.","Redwald thanks you for your work, but goes on to explain that not all heretics truly believe in the Dravanian Horde's doctrine.
