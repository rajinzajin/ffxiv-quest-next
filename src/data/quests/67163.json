After once more instructing you on how to use the horn to summon Hraesvelgr, the moogle bids you a hurried farewell, apparently keen to return to Moghome. You cannot imagine why. Follow the path to Zenith, and blow the horn on the top floor of the palace.","Hraesvelgr answers the call of the horn, but is displeased to find that his sanctuary has been invaded by the children of man. After scornfully dismissing Ysayle's claims to be Shiva reborn, he rebuffs your calls for peace, and recounts the tale of his brood-sister Ratatoskr's murder and the treachery of King Thordan. Man, he concludes, has brought nothing but misery to dragonkind. With that, the immense creature flies away, leaving you to ponder the cost of Nidhogg's eternal quest for vengeance. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on this ill-starred encounter.","Though Hraesvelgr revealed much that was hidden about Ishgard's bloody history, Alphinaud is crushed by the failure of your mission. With your hopes for peace shattered, it is time to consider more desperate measures..."],"objectives":["Blow the horn on the top floor of Zenith.","Speak with Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOGHAN","text":"The campfire was so cozy... I must have fallen asleep, kupo."},{"name":"MOGHAN","text":"But do you feel how the winds have shifted!? They will have borne Hraesvelgr back to the skies above Zenith─I'm sure of it!"},{"name":"MOGHAN","text":"This is your chance to climb to the highest floor of the palace, and summon him with a toot on that shiny horn! So, uh...I-I'll be heading back now, if it's all the same to you. Good luck, kupo! It was nice knowing you!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I trust you are well rested, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? Good. If we are to parley with Hraesvelgr, we shall each have need of the full complement of our wits."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Whenever you are ready, Warrior of Light.

I was worried Hraesvelgr might─ Waaait a moment, kupo. I don't remember hearing any tooting. You haven't summoned him yet...have you? If you haven't, climb to the top of his palace and blow the horn. Oh, and forget what I said. I was rambling. Good luck, kupo!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"So this is the place..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"It is time, Warrior of Light."},{"name":"ICEHEART","text":"Lend me your resolve, Saint Shiva..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Hraesvelgr was every bit as awe-inspiring as I imagined.
