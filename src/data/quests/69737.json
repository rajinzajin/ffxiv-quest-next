Can you help me? I need someone to go around and see if anyone is wanting for supplies."},{"name":"NASHRIFHAL","text":"I would do it myself, but we alchemists are all so busy that no one wants to bother each other with selfish requests. But if an outsider like you asks, they just might open up a bit."},{"name":"NASHRIFHAL","text":"Please. I need to start restocking, but at this rate I'll never know what needs replenishing. I would really appreciate your help."},{"name":"NASHRIFHAL","text":"Thank you! I should mention that it might be a bit difficult to get some of the workers' attention. Everyone is exhausted, so make sure to <span class=\"highlight\">greet</span> them to get them out of their heads."},{"name":"NASHRIFHAL","text":"I'm sure everyone has something they need. They just won't tell me what. Can you talk to them for me? You might need to <span class=\"highlight\">greet</span> them first if they don't notice you."},{"name":"MAHRUVVET","text":"..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"She doesn't seem to notice you. Perhaps if you <span class=\"highlight\">greet</span> her first, she will respond."},{"name":"MAHRUVVET","text":"Apologies, I was malms away. Is there something I can do for you?"},{"name":"MAHRUVVET","text":"Hm... Now that you mention it, I'm running low on serpent's root. It has all sorts of medicinal uses, so I feel I can never have enough."},{"name":"MAHRUVVET","text":"I still have some stock left, but you never know what might come up. It certainly couldn't hurt to have some extra."},{"name":"MAHRUVVET","text":"I still have some serpent's root left, but I can never have too much."},{"name":"JALAMUC","text":"My tea is nearly done, which means I can..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"They're caught up in their work. You may need to <span class=\"highlight\">greet</span> them to get their attention."},{"name":"JALAMUC","text":"Oh! Terribly sorry. It wasn't my intention to ignore you. Can I help you?"},{"name":"JALAMUC","text":"Well, since you ask, I am ever wanting for more tea and milk! A nice cup of chai is just what my body and mind need to unwind after a few sleepless nights of work. "},{"name":"JALAMUC","text":"It isn't something I can readily ask for, seeing as it isn't strictly a necessary medicinal ingredient. I know that seeing to your own well-being is essential to producing quality work, but I just can't bring myself to be so selfish."},{"name":"JALAMUC","text":"It would be nice to have some more tea and milk to help relax."},{"name":"SAJAVAAZ","text":"Hrm... Erhhh..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"He's grumbling something to himself. He may take notice after you <span class=\"highlight\">greet</span> him."},{"name":"SAJAVAAZ","text":"Hmmm? Oh, what's the matter with me? Nearly fell asleep... Sorry about that. Did you need to speak with me?"},{"name":"SAJAVAAZ","text":"Let me think... There are no alchemical components I need at the moment. But I could stand to have some nonperishables on hand."},{"name":"SAJAVAAZ","text":"I end up skipping meals because I'm too busy with work, so something nutritionally dense that I can eat one-handed while I work would be a lifesaver. If there's foodstuff like that, I'll take as much as I can get."},{"name":"SAJAVAAZ","text":"I would really like something quick and nutritious to eat. Preferably something I can eat with one hand while I work."},{"name":"NASHRIFHAL","text":"You're back! What did everyone ask for?"},{"name":"NASHRIFHAL","text":"I had a hunch you'd be able to get more out of them than me. None of these requests are particularly unexpected, but...the only nonperishable food I think we can get is pickles, and that doesn't sound quite like what he wanted..."},{"name":"NASHRIFHAL","text":"I do want to make sure everyone is eating properly. I know they all rely on their medicine to get them by when they're too busy to eat. I wonder..."},{"name":"NASHRIFHAL","text":"I'll ask a friend of mine from Sharlayan if there's anything to be done. Anyway, that's a problem for me to think about, not you. Thank you for your help!"}],"reward":{"gil":735,"items":[{"num":2,"id":36037}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69909]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1039516","obj":{"i":1039516,"n":"Nashrifhal","l":3709,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"36037","obj":{"i":36037,"n":"Zurek","l":520,"c":24104,"t":46}},{"type":"quest","id":"69909","obj":{"i":69909,"n":"Shadowed Footsteps","g":11,"l":"Thavnair","s":527}}]}
