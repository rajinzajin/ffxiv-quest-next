Rather than spend <span class=\"emphasis\">another</span> fortune on a new ring or replacement stone, I struck upon an idea."},{"name":"ANDRI","text":"It would be far more economical to hire someone to retrieve a similar gem and affix it to the ring myself.

It is better and safer to retrieve those that have fallen naturally."},{"name":"ANDRI","text":"In other words, where you find these stones, you will also encounter gnomes, hence my reluctance to hunt for one myself."},{"name":"ANDRI","text":"I am positive my lady friend will be pleased to receive such a wonderful gift.
