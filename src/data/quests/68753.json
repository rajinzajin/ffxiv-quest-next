He seems bothered by the thought that their presence on the front line is less a choice than an imposed duty, and would have you ask their feelings on the issue. Arenvald, the more approachable of the pair, is to be found in Rhalgr's Reach.","You locate Arenvald with little trouble, and together you pay a visit to Fordola's cell in the city. The ensuing exchange reveals much about the young warriors and the motivations which drive them, but the ever-bitter Fordola soon bids you leave her be. Relenting to her wishes, you and Arenvald withdraw outside to the streets of the Ala Mhigan Quarter.","Putting aside Arenvald's revealing sentiment at glimpsing Fordola's true feelings, it would seem you've been given an answer to Jajasamu's concerns. Return to the Carline Canopy, and report to the lieutenant.","Upon hearing of Arenvald and Fordola's determination, Jajasamu himself resolves to provide the finest support he can muster─even if that means becoming the “second-best summoner in Eorzea.” He bids you send his regards to Y'mhitra before going on his way.","You return to Y'mhitra, and although she cannot claim you as a mentor, the scholar nevertheless seems inspired by the effect you have on your colleagues. To perfect the summoner's art and encourage the hearts of others─this is the proud burden you are fated to bear."],"objectives":["<span class=\"highlight-yellow\">* This quest has been adjusted.

Well, I am sure you remember."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"He is in Gridania on leave, as it happens, and asked me to direct you to the Carline Canopy should you stop by for one of your unpredictable visits."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"I believe he wished to consult you on some private matter...

Folk need yer help, an' ye've been blessed with the means to help 'em...?"},{"name":"JAJASAMULALASAMU","text":"Well, that's one way o' lookin' at it. Me, I'm in it for the coin─have been ever since I sold me spells with the Company o' Heroes."},{"name":"JAJASAMULALASAMU","text":"Most o' the soldiers I march with ain't much different.

Is that what you came all the way here to ask me about?"},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I fight because I like the idea that I can help others─the feeling that my presence is needed. Not hard to explain, considering how my own mother decided she didn't want me around."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"And then there was that nightmare at the Waking Sands... A'aba and Aulie gave their lives to save mine, and I strive to be the sort of man whose life was worth saving."},{"name":"FORDOLA","text":"How very honorable. But no such lofty ideals rule my actions."},{"name":"FORDOLA","text":"My own will doesn't come into it.
