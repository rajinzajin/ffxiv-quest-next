Verify whether or not these rumors are true by finding the person who sighted these creatures and confirming their story.","You speak with Tourcenet and he assures you that he saw sorbets at Red Rim. They should be dealt with quickly, before they get out of hand. Travel to Red Rim and slay some of the beasts to keep their numbers in check.","You have killed four of the monsters. That should keep them under control for the time being. Return to Ingaret and let her know that the rumors were true.","Ingaret thanks you for both confirming the rumors and slaying several of the sorbets, too. Sorbets do not normally live in this area, and Ingaret is unable to offer any explanation as to why they are there. She does seem to have a hunch─one she chooses not to disclose."],"objectives":["Speak with Tourcenet.","Slay sorbets.","Report to Ingaret."],"dialogue":[{"name":"INGARET","text":"You're still looking to help out?

There aren't supposed to be sorbets living around here, but if these rumors are true, we'll need to kill them off quickly before they get out of hand."},{"name":"INGARET","text":"Please look into this for me. Whoever saw the creatures must be around here somewhere. See if you can find them and confirm their story."},{"name":"INGARET","text":"Try and find whoever it is that spotted sorbets in the area.

I'm curious to know what prompted you to ask such a question. Besides, nobody I tell actually believes me anyway. But I'm sure they were sorbets.

Those things multiply so quickly, so it won't be long before the snowfields are filled with those disgusting creatures. Please kill some of them.
