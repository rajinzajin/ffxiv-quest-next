The Talos...their hearts cannot be made of just any stone. You need a special sort with sufficient aetherial conductivity. Both it and the other materials used in the construction of Talos bodies are mined in the same place..."},{"name":"JERYK","text":"That place, of course, being here. The Hills of Amber..."},{"name":"JERYK","text":"And it was three years ago when...when she..."},{"name":"JERYK","text":"No, no I can't.
