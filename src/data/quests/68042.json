We have but to seize it with our own two hands."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Was the food to your liking? Good, good..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Now then, Cirina, if you would tell us of the trial we must undertake that we might participate in the Naadam."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Ah, yes! As I mentioned before, to be recognized as warriors of the Steppe, one must follow in the footsteps of the legendary warrior Bardam."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"He embarked on a great pilgrimage, eschewing cart and horse, and walked for many malms until he came to a holy place, thereafter named Bardam's Mettle. There, at the altar, as he did, you must pray."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"The altar lies deep within the breeding grounds of the yol. To complete your trial, you must tame one. Only then will your trial be complete."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Fair enough. And where is the entrance to Bardam's Mettle?"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"You must journey far, far to the west─beyond Chakha Zoh, where lie the bones of a great and wise woman."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Beyond the ruins of Ceol Aen, hidden within the mountains is a narrow pass. Follow it, and you will come to Bardam's Mettle."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Sounds to me like it'll be a trial just getting to the trial..."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"More than you may know. On the eve of the Naadam, many strive to improve their fortunes─some by abducting and enslaving the warriors of other tribes."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Be ever mindful of your surroundings, lest you be taken as well."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Hah! What grim expressions you wear while nodding so powerfully! Warriors such as you are not like to fall en route to a mere rite of passage."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"We shall proceed with all due caution, yes, but let us not worry overmuch."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"We will overcome this trial, and the next, and the next, until we stand triumphant. That is all there is to it, no?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"With me, my friends! To the west! To Bardam's Mettle!"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"W-Wait, Hien! Oh dear. I knew I would forget."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Here─take these whistles. Once tamed, your yol will hearken to their call."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Thanks. We'll try them out once we've finished the trial."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Let's catch up to Hien and Gosetsu!"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"It is indeed a perilous journey, but I know you will succeed─as I once did."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We still have a long way to go, but I think I can see that monument Cirina talked about."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I don't see Hien or Gosetsu, though. We should hurry!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Hey...I don't know about you, but I can't shake the feeling someone's watching us."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Cirina did warn us about tribes that kidnap warriors and make them fight for them. Something tells me we're about to meet them..."},{"name":"BALLOON","text":"The foreigners!"},{"name":"BALLOON","text":"Your blood shall water the soil."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"They're wearing yellow. I've seen their clothes somewhere before..."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Is that the best you can do!? Come, villains! Come at me!"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Ah, there you are. As you can see, they left us little choice."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"I gather you were forced to dispatch a few yourself? So it goes. A few less warriors to face in the Naadam, eh?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Ceol Aen is not much further. That said, I should be surprised if our would-be masters do not try to subdue us one final time..."},{"name":"BALLOON","text":"They are here!? To arms!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"&lt;huff&gt; &lt;puff&gt; This is it! The real trial!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Tread softly. We are for hallowed ground, and the kami are restless..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Right. This must be the pass that leads to Bardam's Mettle."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"They say no foreigners have overcome this trial, but, well, there is a first time for everything, no?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Perhaps you do not hail from these lands, but your forefathers did. You do them honor to carry on their legacy this day."}],"reward":{"gil":890,"items":[{"id":18346,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18348,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18350,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18360,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5723,"one":1}],"xp":207900},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":65,"id":142}],"quests":[68041]},"next":[68043]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1020544","obj":{"i":1020544,"n":"Hien","l":2411,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020679","obj":{"i":1020679,"n":"Hien","l":2411,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020501","obj":{"i":1020501,"n":"Cirina","l":2411,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020539","obj":{"i":1020539,"n":"Cirina","l":2411,"q":7}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020545","obj":{"i":1020545,"n":"Lyse","l":2411,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020546","obj":{"i":1020546,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2411,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020670","obj":{"i":1020670,"n":"Lyse","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020671","obj":{"i":1020671,"n":"Lyse","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020672","obj":{"i":1020672,"n":"Lyse","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020673","obj":{"i":1020673,"n":"Hien","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020674","obj":{"i":1020674,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020680","obj":{"i":1020680,"n":"Lyse","l":2411,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020681","obj":{"i":1020681,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2411,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"18346","obj":{"i":18346,"n":"Doman Iron Claws","l":273,"c":31126,"t":1,"p":38916}},{"type":"item","id":"18348","obj":{"i":18348,"n":"Doman Iron Lance","l":273,"c":31938,"t":5,"p":38916}},{"type":"item","id":"18350","obj":{"i":18350,"n":"Doman Iron Daggers","l":273,"c":33916,"t":84,"p":38916}},{"type":"item","id":"18360","obj":{"i":18360,"n":"Doman Iron Kite Shield","l":273,"c":30159,"t":11,"p":12972}},{"type":"item","id":"5723","obj":{"i":5723,"n":"Quicktongue Materia V","l":160,"c":20259,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Spell Speed","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68041","obj":{"i":68041,"n":"The Heart of Nations","g":6,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":630}},{"type":"quest","id":"68043","obj":{"i":68043,"n":"In the Footsteps of Bardam the Brave","g":6,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":650}}]}
