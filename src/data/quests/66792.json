Speak with Elder Frixio and form a plan to halt the ritual and bring the yet-sealed podling back to Little Solace.","The overstrung scholar Voyce has finally snapped completely, believing himself to be a heroic chocobo and insisting to accompany you on your quest to rescue the Chosen One from Diluxio's clutches. Rendezvous with the self-styled “Voco” by the entrance to the Sylphlands.","As expected, Voco will require your protection while offering little in return. Keep the crazed bird-man out of harm's way and make for the Seedbed. Should Voco wander away, return to the starting point and try anew.","You have successfully navigated your way through the Sylphlands, and the Seedbed stands before you. Speak with Voco in hopes that he will manage not to sabotage the rescue effort with his typical bumblings.","By some miracle, the scholar Voyce maintained a shred of sanity, managing to snatch up the podling while Diluxio was otherwise distracted. Fend off Diluxio's underlings and meet up with the unlikely hero east of the Seedbed.","Voyce gave all that he had, but his legs will carry him no further. To see that the ill-fated scholar's sacrifice will not be in vain, take the sylph podling into hand.","See the podling back to Little Solace while your arms and legs can still bear the burden.<br><br>※To bolster your strength while carrying the podling, interact with the patches of moongrass that you find along the way.","The sylph podling has been returned to Little Solace, where the Chosen One will be free from the influence of the hateful Diluxio. Share the good tidings with Olmxio and prepare for the birthing rite.","The Chosen One has emerged from her podling to recognize Elder Frixio as her nurturing one. Raised in the peaceful surroundings of Little Solace with those who will teach her love and kindness, the Chosen One will surely lead her people into an era of peace and prosperity. In other news, it turns out that the bungling scholar Voyce still lives, much to the chagrin of all who find themselves in his company. Leave him to his bumblings and report back to Commander Heuloix in Gridania on the success of the sylphic campaign.","You report to Commander Heuloix, only to learn that the insufferable Voyce has already submitted a report and taken credit for the lion's share of your deeds. Accept your modest reward, and take heart in knowing that your deeds will live on in the hearts of the sylphs of Little Solace, who will forever recognize you as a true friend to the forest."],"objectives":["Speak with Frixio.","Speak with Voco by the entrance to the Sylphlands.","Accompany Voco to the Seedbed.","Speak with Voco.","Rescue Voyce.","Pick up the sylph podling.","Carry the sylph podling to Little Solace.","Speak with Olmxio.","Report to Vorsaile Heuloix at the Adders' Nest in Gridania."],"dialogue":[{"name":"OLMXIO","text":"Friendly one!
