Baa, baa! Baaaaaa!"},{"name":"SHEEP04715","text":"&lt;rustle&gt; Baaaaaa!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Having emphatically imparted its message, the sheep dashes off. You can only hope that this letter contains some manner of sheep-to-Vrandtic dictionary."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The script is comprised of several distinct hands, and a sweet, flowery fragrance lifts from the page. Your thoughts wander naturally to the pixies of Il Mheg."},{"name":"LETTER04715","text":"(-Flowery Letter-)Greetings, sapling of the king! If you are reading this, it means our precious fluffy has proven itself most admirably as a messenger sheep."},{"name":"LETTER04715","text":"(-Flowery Letter-)We write you with some fascinating news─a talking leafman has appeared in Il Mheg!"},{"name":"LETTER04715","text":"(-Flowery Letter-)You remember our leafmen, don't you? Those dreary mortals we furbished into darling shrubbery? Well, they're not usually much for conversation on account of being topiary bushes, but this one simply jabbers on!"},{"name":"LETTER04715","text":"(-Flowery Letter-)Such an accomplished leafman must pique your interest, yes? Come and find us in Lydha Lran and we shall introduce you! "},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Erm! Excuse me, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. Might I have a word? ...If you can understand me, that is."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"You can! Oh, what a relief. Please, help me! My mind is in a terrible haze at present, and these flittering, chittering <span class=\"emphasis\">children</span> have done nothing but cackle and poke at me."},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Delighted Pixie-)You came! I knew you would. The king's sapling would never pass up a wonder this delightful!"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Eo Tyr-)I am Eo Tyr, and this is Lor Ul and Aenc Ose. We wrote you that letter together!"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Sapling...?"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"W-Wait, are you a plant!? I thought you were a <span class=\"emphasis\">person</span> come to help me. Oooh, please tell me you aren't some tree who simply <span class=\"emphasis\">looks</span> like a person!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Don't worry─I'm a sapling to some, but definitely a person."},{"name":"A1","text":"I am Feo Ul's stalwart sapling!"},{"name":"A1","text":"Sapling, seedling, heavenspillar...tree metaphors seem to follow me."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Is that supposed to make sense!?"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"S-So you're not a person after all? How─ What─ Oooh, I feel faint..."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Speak plainly, I beg of you─are you or aren't you made of wood!?"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Eo Tyr-)Tee hee hee! Why, you sound so distraught─as though you aren't the greenest and leafiest one here!"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Eo Tyr-)What marvelous fun this is. In exchange for making me laugh, I'll share with you both a little secret."},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Eo Tyr-)This chatty little bushling sprouted from none other than Anden, one of the leafmen inside these stables."},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Eo Tyr-)As for why...who knows? Maybe Anden's spirit is simply overflowing with life, or maybe all my pruning and wishing finally paid off. Or both!"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Eo Tyr-)Regardless, the two are connected by their roots, which means they are both undeniably Anden!"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"(-Anden-)So, my name is Anden... Is it!? My memories are so muddled, I can't tell if it feels familiar or not..."},{"name":"LORUL","text":"(-Lor Ul-)Oho! Why don't we <span class=\"emphasis\">muddle</span> Anden back into his original form, then? That sounds like wonderful fun."},{"name":"AENCOSE","text":"(-Aenc Ose-)Oh, how lovely. Let's change him back!"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Eo Tyr-)No! Absolutely not!"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"Everyone knows that trying to change a leafman back only ends in a mucky <span class=\"emphasis\">mud</span>man. Anden won't be another attempt gone wrong─I won't allow it!"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"(-Anden-)Y-You mean to say that my choice is between remaining a bush or becoming...mud? That I shall never again assume personage!? Oooh, say it isn't so... Please!"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Feo Ul, I need you."},{"name":"A2","text":"Help me, Feo Ul. You're this talking bush's only hope..."},{"name":"A2","text":"King of the fae, hear my cry!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-Feo Ul-)Yes, yes! That's it, my precious sapling! You should have called upon me <span class=\"emphasis\">immediately</span>, of course─but how could I be anything but delighted that you remembered me all on your own?"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-Feo Ul-)Whatever your desire, your beautiful branch is at your service!"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"(-Eo Tyr-)Y-Your Majesty!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"'Tis true─none have yet returned a leafman to its original form. But let such improbabilities become mere trifles if such is my sapling's wish! In fact, it could be accomplished by none other."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"You and your friends possess the ability to heal those tainted by Light's corruption, do you not? Were that knowledge to be coupled with my strength as king, this leafman may yet return to his erstwhile self."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"However, such deeply transformative magicks are a far cry from simple pixie glamours. If you cannot hold the clearest image of your true form within your mind's eye, your fate as a mudman is all but sealed."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"You know what must be done, my darling sapling. Call for me again once your preparations are complete!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"I mustn't let Anden become a sloppy, slabby mudman! How can I help?"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Well, I take great comfort in knowing that I am not condemned to an eternity of muck or twigs, but recalling my true form feels like a daunting task indeed..."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"...Speaking of true forms, what was the consensus on yours, then? Person? Tree? Honestly, I'm more confused than ever after that last conversation."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Oooh, a nickname! That makes far more sense─you do <span class=\"emphasis\">look</span> quite like a person. And you say your name is “<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>”? A pleasure to meet you."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Now, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I don't mean to impose, but seeing as I am shackled here by roots and surrounded by plant-harassing mischief-makers, you may be my only living ally in this world. Please, please help me remember who I truly am!"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Oh, thank you! I will do my utmost to remember promptly."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Of course, simply <span class=\"emphasis\">trying</span> to remember something you so utterly can't seems like a rather fruitless endeavor. There must be some reliable way of stirring up latent memories..."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"If I had hands, I'd give myself a smart rap on the head to get the blood flowing. ...Or sap flowing, as it were."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"But you have hands, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Would you be so kind as to give me a good, solid smack in what might be my cranial region? Just to get the leafy matter engaged."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"...W-Wait! I just got a better look at your biceps, so perhaps not. &lt;shudder&gt;"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"Anden, Anden, you mustn't beat upon the bush! I know I got a little carried away tugging at your leaves and all, but I'm ready to help, now─and I know you better than anyone!"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"I've even seen your true form before! But simply telling you what I know isn't going to help you <span class=\"emphasis\">truly</span> remember who you were, and you must truly, <span class=\"emphasis\">truly</span> remember your true form if you are truly to return safely!"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"True... I must say, that is surprisingly thoughtful for someone who was tee-hee-ing at my distress not moments ago. But if you can't tell me anything, how do you intend to help?"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"Well, I never said I couldn't tell you <span class=\"emphasis\">anything</span>─just nothing too important to be told!"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"I'll give you little hints and pieces, instead. Like this─do you remember being a shepherd, Anden? You so loved your fluffy white sheep."},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"You loved them so much, in fact, that even those scary sin eaters couldn't drive you away from your flock. You stayed and cared for them until the very end."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Really!? I confess, I don't remember anything of the sort..."},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"...But if you speak the truth, perhaps seeing tools or materials a shepherd might use would induce further recollection!"},{"name":"ANDEN","text":"Not much of a lead, but it's all we have at the moment. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, would you be kind enough to procure me some items fit for a shepherd?"},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"We'll help too! Lor Ul and Aenc Ose love playing shop, so be sure to check their wares for both handy <span class=\"emphasis\">and</span> dandy bits, bobs, and supplies."},{"name":"EOTYR","text":"Lately, Lor Ul has been fascinated with what you mortals call “scrips,” but sweet Aenc Ose will be happy to take your shiny coin just the same. Oh, what fun we shall have! I can hardly wait to get started."}],"reward":{"gil":984,"items":[{"num":3,"id":36053},{"num":3,"id":36054}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":35}],"questsType":"all","quests":[70000,67634]},"next":[70252]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1044553","obj":{"i":1044553,"n":"Supplicant Sheep","l":2951,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1044558","obj":{"i":1044558,"n":"Anden","l":2956,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"36053","obj":{"i":36053,"n":"Giant Haddock Dip","l":540,"c":24258,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"36054","obj":{"i":36054,"n":"Yakow Moussaka","l":540,"c":24112,"t":46}},{"type":"quest","id":"70000","obj":{"i":70000,"n":"Endwalker","g":11,"l":"Ultima Thule","s":618}},{"type":"quest","id":"67634","obj":{"i":67634,"n":"Go West, Craftsman","g":95,"l":"Mor Dhona","s":600,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"70252","obj":{"i":70252,"n":"Every Anden of the Rainbow","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":4010,"f":1}}]}
