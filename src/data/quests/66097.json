He wishes to learn more of the tome's origins for his own erudition, and asks that you accompany him to question Gerolt. Speak with the blacksmith, and help the alchemist solve this lingering mystery.","Upon consulting Gerolt, you learn that it was Jalzahn's ancient forefather who penned the Book of Netherdark. Moreover, you discover that the author left as his legacy the title of “Starforger” to the person who could succeed in fully recreating a legendary arm of yore. Gerolt and Jalzahn, both desirous of this, allow their pride to tear them apart. Speak with Jalzahn now, to discover if the matter has been resolved.","Unable to decide who should be crowned “Starforger,” Jalzahn has decided to remain in Hyrstmill until Gerolt gives up his claim. However, the alchemist can now continue to aid you with your arm should the need arise. With a fondness in his voice, Jalzahn bids you to go forth, and use your Zodiac Weapon for good and so create your own legend."],"objectives":["Speak with Gerolt.","Speak with Jalzahn."],"dialogue":[{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"My dear, dear <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">girl</span><span class=\"alternative\">boy</span></span>!

"},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"I had devoted my life to just these two goals, yet neither could I have accomplished alone. Though I risked life and limb, verily 'twas right I should come to Eorzea."},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"One matter puzzles me still, however: why was the Book of Netherdark─a priceless resource─never completed nor circulated?"},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"If I have learned anything by now, 'tis that Gerolt can shed some light on the matter. Come, my friend, let us make one last journey across the village green─for the sake of knowledge itself!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In order to receive the quest “The Vital Title,” you must be equipped with a Zodiac Weapon Zeta.

Why is it ye keep houndin' me like a pair o' bloody debt collectors?"},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"We have merely come with a question about the Book of Netherdark, Gerolt. Where did you lay hands upon this unfinished tome, pray tell?"},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Eh? Well, Rowena's place, o' course. I came across it while I was pickin' up the rest o' the Trials of the Braves."},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Rowena said she'd only sell the tome to a collector what'd pay a king's ransom fer it─till I threatened to wed her again, that is. Well, ye can bet she handed it over in a hurry after that, hehe."},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"I-Is that so?"},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Er...anyroad, there's prints aplenty o' the Trials, but I've heard nothin' about another copy o' the Book of Netherdark. Like as not, that's why ye never saw it in Radz–at–Han."},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"See, the Trials is a load o' scattered tales about the ancient heroes gathered an' bound up in a book. 'Tis admired as a work o' fancy jus' as much as an account o' the ancients."},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"But this Book of Netherdark, well, it's jus' raw facts. Seems like it were added to the set after everythin' else, an' ye can tell that no editor's pen ever touched it. 'Tis really jus' a treatise on the Zodiac Braves."},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"So we owe our gratitude to a scholar... Was there aught by which to identify the author? I would remember him, and so learn by his example."},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Hells, Jalzahn, I don't... Well, now that ye mention it, there <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> a name written here. Looks like “Ulthalam”..."},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"“Ulthalam,” you say!? He was the father of my line─an artisan famed for his pursuit of knowledge!"},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Well, I'll be thrice damned!

Jus' a moment..."},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">After years of careful study, I come to realize that I, Ulthalam, cannot recreate an arm of the Zodiac Braves.

Though I knew it not, I have dreamed the same dream as my forefather! Everything, from my encounter with tales of the Braves to my choice of studies, must have been written in the stars!"},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"&lt;sniff&gt; In sooth, 'twas right that I journeyed countless malms and weathered stormy seas to come to Eorzea. Hearken to me, spirit of Ulthalam! Rest well, knowing that I, Jalzahn, accept the title of Starforger from you!"},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Oi! Hold on fer one soddin' second!"},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Might be as yer the one what came with the <span class=\"emphasis\">tale</span> o' the legendary weapons, but who was it what made the bloody thing?"},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Me, that's who!

I had thought you were but rough around the edges, but I see now that I was right about you from the start! You are the greatest boor in all the lands!"},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Bah!

The title should go to someone what's got a future, an' if ye can't see that, then yer the biggest arse around!"},{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Can ye believe the bleedin' nerve o' that ol' coot!? The hells take him─an' leave the title fer me!"},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"Whew... That encounter has quite sapped my strength─though not my sense of outrage. I can scarce believe that boor would not yield so much as an ilm!"},{"name":"JALZAHN","text":"I simply cannot abide the thought of Gerolt taking that title.
