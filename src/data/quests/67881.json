The child proudly declares that he knows where the crystals are stored, and charges off towards U'Ghamaro, eager to guide you and the twins to the first cache.","Alphinaud and Alisaie make short work of the kobold sentries, leaving you to secure the crystals while they stand guard. Though the beastmen appear to be unaware of your presence for now, there is no telling when a patrol may stumble upon you and sound the alarum.","You pack up the crystals and signal your readiness to move on. Ga Bu duly shouts for you to follow him deeper into U'Ghamaro, and you and the twins give chase, albeit rather more cautiously.","After shoveling the contents of the second cache into your pack, you and Alisaie turn to Ga Bu and prepare to press on. Alphinaud, however, lingers for a moment, crouching over the now empty crate with a puzzled expression on his face. Rising at length, he states that the container once bore Ishgardian seals, which someone took great pains to remove. Reasoning that the kobolds would not journey to Aldenard to obtain crystals, much less bother with such precautions, he deduces that the crate must have been smuggled out of Ishgard and transported across the sea─likely at the behest of the Ascians. Alas, there is no time to dwell on the implications of this discovery as the third cache of crystals awaits.","Ga Bu leads you to what he believes to be the location of the third cache, only to find that there is nothing there. A thorough survey of the area serves to confirm your suspicions: the crystals have been moved. Alphinaud can only assume that they are now deep within O'Ghomoro, at the site of the summoning ritual. That being the case, you have no recourse but to breach the Navel once more and seize the remaining crystals by force. Before you launch your attack, however, Alphinaud insists that you hand over the crystals in your pack, reasoning that it would be reckless to take them with you into the enemy's midst.","With the crystals in his possession, Alphinaud departs for Camp Overlook, promising to return after warning the Maelstrom forces to prepare for the worst. Together with Alisaie and Ga Bu, you continue onward into the U'Ghamaro Mines, towards the beastman aetheryte which will deliver you into the heart of the mountain.","Having been rejoined by Alphinaud, you all teleport into the Navel and order the kobold patriarch and his minions to surrender. Ga Bu duly demands to see his parents, but realizes to his horror that you have arrived too late, and that they and the other prisoners have already been executed. Even as Alphinaud makes a final attempt to reason with the patriarch, the kobold child cries out over and over again for his parents to wake up, his wailing filling the chamber, growing louder, more intense─and then, as if in answer, the gathered crystals begin to glow. Moments later, the aether begins to coalesce, dragging the rocks towards a single point, until the Lord of Crags stands before you in all his terrible fury. With a mixture of joy and confusion, the kobolds look on their Great Father, who fixes them with his burning gaze...before casting them from the platform in a fit of rage. You and Alisaie move to defend the distraught Ga Bu while Alphinaud conjures a Carbuncle to distract the raging primal, and as Titan claws at his face, the four of you make your escape.","As Alisaie tends to Ga Bu, who remains unconscious following his ordeal, you and Alphinaud discuss how best to proceed. While summoned with far fewer crystals than intended, the Titan born of the child's anguish is nevertheless a threat which cannot be ignored, for he will only grow stronger as he draws aether from the land. And so it falls to you to return to the Navel, and there put the rampaging avatar of grief out of its misery.<br><br>※The Navel (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","As the primal's form gradually fades from existence, his final despairing pleas echo in your ears. Though justifiably relieved, the shadow of the tragedy which granted him life yet looms large in your thoughts, and you know not how to feel. Nevertheless, Titan is no more, and you are free to return to Camp Overlook and the others.","Although Ga Bu has at last awakened from his torpor, the child has spoken nary a word. With great trepidation, Alphinaud gives voice to the unhappy possibility that Ga Bu may have fallen prey to the primal's influence. Should that prove to be the case, you will have no choice but to surrender him to the Maelstrom for summary execution. For the time being, however, you can but watch, wait, and pray that he recovers."],"objectives":["Speak with Ga Bu.","Secure the cache of crystals in U'Ghamaro.","Secure the second cache of crystals.","Survey the area for the third cache of crystals.","Give the crystals to Alphinaud.","Follow Ga Bu and Alisaie.","Speak with Alphinaud.","Confront Titan in the Navel (Hard).","Speak with Alphinaud in Camp Overlook."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Let us pray that we still have time to save Ga Bu's parents..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"What sort of twisted monster would consider a ritual focus a work of art, knowing full well how it was made? And we call <span class=\"emphasis\">them</span> beastmen."},{"name":"GABU","text":"I heard Great Father Titan loves crystals. Cherishes, covets, loves them, and if we gather enough, He will return. That's why the patriarch told everyone to go forth and gather them."},{"name":"GABU","text":"So I was thinking, if we take all the crystals away, maybe the Great Father won't come?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Very good, Ga Bu. I was just thinking the same thing. Do you know where these crystals are stored?"},{"name":"GABU","text":"I know, I know, oh, oh, oh! Several spots, each defended by a different order!"},{"name":"GABU","text":"Ga Bu wanted to steal them, but he was too afraid to go alone. Yes, yes, too afraid to go alone."},{"name":"GABU","text":"But together we can take them away and hide them! Come, come─Ga Bu will lead you to the first cache!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Pray see to the crystals. Alisaie and I will stand guard for any errant patrols."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"That hardly seemed fair. Then again, they only have themselves to blame."},{"name":"GABU","text":"Quickly, quickly!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Do you have them all? Good.

Brother!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Aye, aye, it's just that..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I am quite certain that crate once bore Ishgardian seals. Someone took great pains to remove all traces, but enough remains to make out the pattern. See for yourself."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I struggle to imagine kobolds traveling to Coerthas to obtain crystals, much less bothering to conceal their origins."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I suspect these crystals were smuggled into Vylbrand by another party─most likely a pawn of the Ascians, as Thancred speculated."},{"name":"GABU","text":"I don't understand. Who are the Ascians? Do they worship Great Father Titan too?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Ah, never you mind about that. As Alisaie said, we do not have a lot of time. Can you lead us to the next cache, Ga Bu?"},{"name":"GABU","text":"Yes, yes, yes, of course! Ga Bu knows the way!"},{"name":"GABU","text":"This next one is the last and is very large! Very big, very huge, very large!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Ga Bu said the cache would be here, but unless it is remarkably well hidden..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We should pack up the crystals and leave─now.

What about you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? Any luck?"},{"name":"GABU","text":"Nothing, nothing, nothing! But this cannot be! Ga Bu saw them! Spied, spotted, saw!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Think, Brother, think! They must have moved them, yes? The question is, where to, and why?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...Within O'Ghomoro, where they summoned Titan once before and mean to do so again. It is the only explanation."},{"name":"GABU","text":"What about Mother and Father and the others!? We have to help them!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And we will, Ga Bu, we will! Stay calm─we still have time."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"They have yet to call for the remaining crates, yes? If they had, then they would have found the other caches empty and sounded the alarum."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Nevertheless, I believe the time for stealth has passed. We must breach the Navel and seize the remaining crystals. There is no other way to prevent Titan's summoning."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But first, give me your crystals, that I might deliver them into Commander Bloeidin's custody. We dare not take them into the bowels of the mountain."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Alphinaud is right. 'Twould be folly to deliver the kobolds the very thing we sought to deny them."},{"name":"GABU","text":"Mother, Father, we're coming..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The crystals, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, if you would be so kind."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Thank you. I shall deliver them to Camp Overlook for safekeeping and brief Commander Bloeidin on the situation."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Pray go on ahead. As I recall, there is an aetheryte within the U'Ghamaro Mines that should deliver you to the Navel. Ga Bu doubtless knows the way. Wait for me there─I shall rejoin you anon."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Strange─I would've thought you eager to remain in the thick of the action. But if this is what you would prefer, then godsspeed, Brother."},{"name":"GABU","text":"This way, this way!"},{"name":"GABU","text":"I hope the patriarch and my parents are there..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Ah. I take it this is the aetheryte we seek? Right then."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"As soon as Alphinaud arrives, we go. I trust you're feeling suitably heroic, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─there's no telling what sort of resistance we'll face in there."},{"name":"ZADA","text":"Quickly, you clods! Briskly, swiftly, quickly! I will not suffer any further delays!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Lay down your arms and surrender! We have your crystals. There will be no summoning this day!"},{"name":"ZADA","text":"Overdwellers!? Here!? But how did you─"},{"name":"GABU","text":"Where are my parents, Patriarch!? Where are they!?"},{"name":"GABU","text":"Mother...? Father..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"\"Coke for the furnace“? You <span class=\"emphasis\">monster</span>. How could you!?"},{"name":"ZADA","text":"I... <span class=\"emphasis\">We</span> are but servants of the Lord of Crags.

Not yet."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I understand, Patriarch. I do. Your fear, your anger, your hate..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"You would do anything to protect your people─anything to deliver them from despair. Whatever it takes to ensure that those who threaten you can never do so again."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But in your single-minded pursuit of this objective, you have brought suffering on your own kith and kin. You have sacrificed the lives of the very people you sought to protect!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But it need not be this way, Patriarch! Renounce this bloody course! Cease your attempts to summon your god, and work with us, together, to build a lasting peace!"},{"name":"ZADA","text":"Another peace to be abandoned at the overdwellers' convenience! Oathbreakers, all of you! Liars, betrayers, oathbreakers!"},{"name":"ZADA","text":"You take and you take and you take, and when you have had your fill, you sue for peace. You promise that <span class=\"emphasis\">this time</span>, this time is the last─until you grow hungry again!"},{"name":"ZADA","text":"And when we dare to defend ourselves, you declare that this “beast tribe” cannot be suffered to live! That our god drains the land of aether, and brings naught but suffering─death, destruction, suffering upon us all!"},{"name":"ZADA","text":"I will hear no more lies from you and yours, overdweller! You've ruined your own lands─you'll not ruin ours!"},{"name":"GABU","text":"I said I'd come for you, and I did! I'm here...I'm here...I'm here..."},{"name":"GABU","text":"Say something, please.

I should have known better than to let Ga Bu accompany us, given what we were like to find."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"His anguish and despair have served to birth a primal, just as surely as would the supplications of the faithful. Worse, being born of such tumultuous emotion, this incarnation of Titan seems incapable of naught but violence."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If we have one cause for optimism, it is that while many crystals were present, they represented but a fraction of the quantity intended for the summoning ritual."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...Meaning that Titan must be far weaker than planned."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Be that as it may, he is yet a primal, and the longer we leave him to bleed the land of aether, the stronger he will grow."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And should Titan be permitted to leave O'Ghomoro, more lives will be lost. The Maelstrom will rally their troops, and the cycle will continue."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you know what must be done. Will you face the Lord of Crags once more?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Thank you, my friend."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Alisaie and I will tend to Ga Bu. When you have finished with the primal, look for us in Camp Overlook.

Gods, what a relief..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Ah, there <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> is! Did I not tell you <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> would return safe and sound?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The deed is done, then? Titan is no more?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Good. There has been enough tragedy this day."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"He has been like that since he regained consciousness. We believe he can hear us, but he has made no attempt to respond."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"He is almost certainly still in shock, but...<br>But we cannot discount the possibility that he succumbed to the primal's influence. Should that prove to be the case─"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"He must be put to death, like any other thrall. Such is the Alliance's policy, yes?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...You have the right of it."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But we must not rush to conclusions. After all, we once feared that Ysayle's followers were beyond reason, and many have since laid down their arms and accepted Ishgard's peace."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...We can but watch, wait, and pray."}],"reward":{"gil":1500,"xp":16740},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":142}],"quests":[67880]},"next":[67882]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1016815","obj":{"i":1016815,"n":"Ga Bu","l":350,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017744","obj":{"i":1017744,"n":"Alphinaud","l":350,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017736","obj":{"i":1017736,"n":"Alphinaud","l":350,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017737","obj":{"i":1017737,"n":"Alisaie","l":350,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017739","obj":{"i":1017739,"n":"Alisaie","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017740","obj":{"i":1017740,"n":"Ga Bu","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017741","obj":{"i":1017741,"n":"Alphinaud","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017742","obj":{"i":1017742,"n":"Alisaie","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017743","obj":{"i":1017743,"n":"Ga Bu","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017745","obj":{"i":1017745,"n":"Alisaie","l":350,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017746","obj":{"i":1017746,"n":"Ga Bu","l":350,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017865","obj":{"i":1017865,"n":"Ga Bu","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017866","obj":{"i":1017866,"n":"Alphinaud","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017867","obj":{"i":1017867,"n":"Alisaie","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017868","obj":{"i":1017868,"n":"Ga Bu","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017869","obj":{"i":1017869,"n":"Alphinaud","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017870","obj":{"i":1017870,"n":"Alisaie","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017871","obj":{"i":1017871,"n":"Ga Bu","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017872","obj":{"i":1017872,"n":"Alphinaud","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017873","obj":{"i":1017873,"n":"Alisaie","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1018111","obj":{"i":1018111,"n":"Ga Bu","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1018112","obj":{"i":1018112,"n":"Alphinaud","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1018113","obj":{"i":1018113,"n":"Alisaie","l":350,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67880","obj":{"i":67880,"n":"Unlikely Allies","g":5,"l":"Outer La Noscea","s":4}},{"type":"quest","id":"67882","obj":{"i":67882,"n":"Beneath a Star-filled Sky","g":5,"l":"Outer La Noscea","s":6}}]}
