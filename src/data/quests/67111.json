Or to be more accurate, <span class=\"emphasis\">redeliver</span> it: the moogle who preceded you was ambushed by the Ixal, and barely escaped with his pom-pom still attached. The deputy postmoogle bids you make a second attempt: brave the Ixali gauntlet to Eugenia's Spire, and place the letter in the unyielding hands of Miah Molkot, ferocious leader of the White Rams.","Miah scans the note, and licks her lips at the happy news within: her dear friend Philota and the lady's young grandson are to visit. But delight soon turns to alarm when she realizes that the day of their expected arrival has come and gone. Fearing the malign intervention of the Ixal, she bids you seek out her man in Treespeak, slaying any birdman you should encounter along the way.","In Treespeak, you meet with Miah's man─a Gods' Quiver bowman who has fallen into an Ixali ambush. You swiftly defeat his attackers, but the man is still reeling from the birdman assault. Offer the injured bowman your aid.","As you tend to the wounded archer, another Ixal leaps from the brush, swinging his axe. Just as he is about to strike, a familiar figure appears: Miah Molkot. Terrified at the fate that awaits him at the hands of the famous Black Cat, the Ixal proffers a deal: in exchange for his life, he and his comrades will find Philota and her grandson, and return them unharmed. He bids you speak with his leader by the river bend, to whom he will deliver Miah's friends.","You make contact with the Ixali headwing, but he refuses to honor his subordinate's unauthorized pledge. Instead, he presents you with an ultimatum for the White Rams: the Ixal hold Philota and her grandson hostage, and demand to be given free rein in the Twelveswood until such time as they complete a secret objective. As proof of their word, Philota is to be released in advance, on the cliffs overlooking Fallgourd Float. Go to her, and ensure her safety.","The Ixal spoke the truth: on the cliffside stands Philota, shaken yet unharmed. She confirms that the Ixal do indeed have her grandson in their clutches, and bids you return to Eugenia's Spire to enlist Miah's aid in the boy's rescue.","You report to Miah Molkot, who vows to devote her all to the rescue effort. She tells you how Philota's son was the leader of the White Rams before his untimely passing, and the child held hostage is his son in turn. For the Ixal to have kidnapped the boy is an insult to the White Rams' honor, and Miah will stop at nothing until those responsible are brought to her own personal brand of justice. She asks you to return to Philota, now resting at the Bobbing Cork, and assure her that her grandson will be saved.","Philota is reassured by Miah's zeal, but fears her personal involvement in this case may drive the White Rams' leader beyond her usual exuberance and into recklessness. She asks you to return to Eugenia's Spire, and urge Miah not to take any unnecessary risks.","You explain Philota's misgivings to Miah Molkot, but restraint is no longer an option for the maddened Miqo'te. Not only have the Ixal been taunting the White Rams by roaming the Twelveswood at will, using the boy as a shield, they now appear to be repairing to their own lands with the child in tow. Just as Miah is about to give the order to strike, a message comes from her scouts: true to their word, the Ixal have released Philota's grandson near Proud Creek. Fearing for his safety, Miah urges you to assist her men in finding the child before something more dastardly does.","Despite the White Rams' best efforts, it is your eagle eye that first picks out Philota's grandson. He explains to you how the Ixal who held him hostage were not an invasion force, but a rescue team, hunting for a missing hatchling. Furthermore, the chieftain who released the boy left behind some strange words that seem to relate to some forgotten past. But Proud Creek is no place to linger in thought─you link up with another of the search team, who agrees to convey the boy back to the relative safety of Eugenia's Spire. Rendezvous with them there, and report these latest developments to Instructor Molkot.","You meet with the bowman back at Eugenia's Spire, but all is not well. Despite the pleas of her soft-hearted subordinate, Miah Molkot is determined to take revenge on the Ixali rescue team, and strike them down before they reach the border─hatchling and all. The bowman urges you to speak with Philota at the Bobbing Cork and explain the situation, that she might convince the ruthless instructor to call off the attack.","You relay the events to Philota, who vows to do all she can to persuade Miah to be merciful. She asks you to return with all haste to Eugenia's Spire, and delay the attack until she arrives.","You return to the spire in time to hear Miah giving the final order to set upon the retreating Ixal. But just as the bowmen are about to depart, Philota arrives to relate a fateful tale from the past. Twenty years earlier, the White Rams, under the leadership of Philota's late son, released Ixali hatchlings to secure the safety of a young girl─a girl by the name of Miah Molkot. By the Ixali headwing's words, he could only be one of those hatchlings whose life was spared in exchange for hers. Unwilling to sever the ties of destiny put in place by her master so long before, Miah Molkot calls off the attack. And so, after twenty long years, a temporary truce returns to the Twelveswood."],"objectives":["Deliver the letter to Miah Molkot at Eugenia's Spire.","Assist the Gods' Quiver bow in Treespeak.","Speak with the Gods' Quiver bow.","Find the Ixali headwing in Treespeak.","Speak with Philota on the cliffs east of Fallgourd Float.","Report to Miah Molkot.","Speak with Philota in the Bobbing Cork.","Report to Miah Molkot.","Search for Philota's grandson north of Proud Creek.","Rendezvous with the Gods' Quiver bow at Eugenia's Spire.","Speak with Philota at the Bobbing Cork.","Speak with Miah Molkot."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!

If anyone can rescue him from those brutes, Miah can."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"Near twenty years have passed since the day we first met, back when my son was still the leader of the White Rams. Before he...was taken from us. A report came in that a settlement was under Ixali attack, and he raced to its defense."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"By the time he and his men arrived, the Ixal had already captured the village. My son refused to abandon it to their clutches, and led a daring attempt to rescue the villagers. He finally succeeded in expelling the invaders, but their deadly work was done. Only one child emerged alive from the ruins─Miah."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"My son took the orphaned girl under his wing, and taught her bowmanship.

I could not live with myself were my grandson's safety to be bought with friendly blood..."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"Miah has always been such a...<span class=\"emphasis\">passionate</span> young lady. It serves her well in her work, but I fear her personal investment in this may make her act rashly. I pray you, would you talk with her, and persuade her not to take any needless risks?"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"Lady Philota said that...? Even with her grandson held captive by the birdmen, she worries for the safety of our soldiers? Truly, the lady's consideration knows no bounds..."},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"But I fear the time for restraint is past. It sickens me to sit by while the birdmen prowl our forests, using one of our own as a shield!

Over and out!"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"Did you hear that, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!? The birdmen say they have released the boy...but in <span class=\"emphasis\">Proud Creek</span>, of all places! Why, he would almost be safer in their evil clutches!

Thank you so much for coming to rescue me!"},{"name":"YOUNGBOY01575","text":"Oh, yes, I'm quite all right. They didn't hurt me...only my pride. I was such a fool, stumbling straight into that Ixali camp. I'm sorry for causing everyone to go to such trouble to rescue me. Miah wouldn't have let herself get caught so easily. Nor would my father..."},{"name":"YOUNGBOY01575","text":"I'm just thankful the Ixal were true to their word. I overheard some of what they were discussing: it seemed they were searching for a hatchling of theirs─the young of a chieftain who had disappeared from his nest. They had followed his trail into Treespeak."},{"name":"YOUNGBOY01575","text":"They were readying forces to launch an invasion to recover the child, knowing it would lead to all-out war with Gridania. But then they somehow learned of mine and Grandmama's arrival, and resolved to kidnap us instead, to secure the truce that would allow a rescue party to search unhindered."},{"name":"YOUNGBOY01575","text":"But there is something I don't understand... When the leader of the Ixal cut my bonds, he whispered something strange to me: “His promise, your father kept.

Come, child─follow me!"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"My grandson is safe!? Words cannot begin to express my gratitude, but they are all I have to offer! Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, thank you! A thousand times, thank you!"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"Well done, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Now that we have the boy, the birdies want for a shield!

All Ixal must die!"},{"name":"WHITERAMARCHER01575","text":"I-I know, but...please, ma'am, I beg you to reconsider! This was not an invasion, it was a rescue mission! They were searching for a lost hatchling!"},{"name":"WHITERAMARCHER01575","text":"And after all, they did keep their promise─they released the boy! Surely it is only right that we should honor our side of the agreement and allow them to leave."},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"What agreement!? Those were <span class=\"emphasis\">their</span> conditions, and they only had the nerve to give them because they were holding the poor boy hostage! They invade our lands, steal our children, and you would show them mercy? The only peace they'll get from me is that of the grave!"},{"name":"WHITERAMARCHER01575","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">Sir</span></span>, you must help me! Go to the Bobbing Cork, and bring back Lady Philota. She is the only one Commander Molkot will listen to!"},{"name":"WHITERAMARCHER01575","text":"There's something that bothers me about all this. It's what that Ixali chieftain said... Something of promises kept in years long past. If anyone knows what he meant by it, Lady Philota will."},{"name":"WHITERAMARCHER01575","text":"What was it again...? “His promise, your father kept. And so the same, I shall do.” Surely we cannot proceed with the attack without knowing what he meant. Perhaps Lady Philota would have some idea?"},{"name":"WHITERAMARCHER01575","text":"You will find her in the Bobbing Cork. Please, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, I do believe she is the only one who'll be able to get through to the commander. You must bring her here before she puts an arrow through the hatchling's head!"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"They think they can invade our lands, kidnap our children, and get away scot–free!? I'll rip out their quills, and make them sign their own death warrants! With their own blood!"},{"name":"YOUNGBOY01575","text":"“His promise, your father kept. And so the same, I shall do.” I'll never forget those words... But my father was the leader of the White Rams, the sworn enemy of the Ixal. What promise could he possibly have made?"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"My grandson is safe...? Thank you, adventurer! A thousand times, thank you! How can I possibly repay you for all you have done for my family?"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"...I see. It appears the situation is more complicated than we first thought. The Ixal that took us were a rescue team...and now Miah plans to attack them in their retreat, and the hatchling with them? And only I can stop her?"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"Perhaps I can, for I indeed have some knowledge of this “promise” the Ixal spoke of. How strange that their fates should be brought together again like this. The elementals work in mysterious ways..."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"Very well. I will talk with Miah. Would it be too much to ask you to do me a further kindness? Run ahead to Eugenia's Spire, and delay her from taking any drastic action. I will join you as soon as I can. The path is steep, and I am afraid I am not as young as I once was..."},{"name":"WHITERAMARCHER01575","text":"It is too late... The commander has already relayed the order to ready the attack. There is nothing more I can do!"},{"name":"YOUNGBOY01575","text":"I know the Ixal are our enemies, but these ones are retreating, and a youngling goes with them. Couldn't we let them go, just this once?"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"All right, you're the last of them! Join up with the forward squadron, and begin the attack! The poor wee birdies won't know what hit them!"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"What is it, adventurerrr? Don't tell me <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> object to my attack as well?"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"(-???-)And so do I, Miah."},{"name":"YOUNGBOY01575","text":"Grandmama!"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"L-Lady Philota! What are you doing here? You have been through so much at the claws of the birdmen─you need to rest!"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"As do you, Miah. There is a story you must needs hear─a story begun long ago, but not yet concluded."},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"A story...? What story?"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"A tale from long ago, when my son led the White Rams as you do now. A time when we found ourselves caught in the same snare as the Ixal did this day, as if reflected in a glass."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"There was a young girl, trapped behind Ixali lines. The White Rams put together a rescue team to save her, and prepared to strike at the heart of the enemy. The Ixal were surrounded, but their defenses were strong. All hope seemed lost..."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"Until, quite by chance, a separate raid led to the capture of several Ixali hatchlings, abandoned in their nests. So both sides came to hold younglings as hostages... Threat was answered with counterthreat, and both sides prepared for a bloody resolution."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"Until my son reached out to the Ixal... He offered them a truce, and a promise: he would return their hatchlings, if the Ixal would withdraw, and spare the child."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"Tell me, my dear... What was it the Ixali chieftain said to you? That your father kept his promise? And so he would keep his in return?"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"It can only be the will of the elementals that brought such a fate to pass... There can be no doubt─that chieftain was one of the Ixali hatchlings my son released that day."},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"It was my son's promise that lifted the siege on the village, and saved the child. A young Miqo'te girl, with an ink-black coat, and shining eyes..."},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"My master bought my life...with his...?"},{"name":"PHILOTA","text":"After twenty long years, the threads of destiny that entwined on that fateful day have brought you together once more. Whether you sever those ties now, or tie them stronger, only your heart can decide."},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"To be bound to an Ixal, or to cut myself free... All right, soldiers..."},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"Call off the attack! Send word to the vanguard: they are to escort the Ixal off our lands, but under no circumstances are the birdmen to be fired upon! Anyone foolish enough to disobey will answer to me!"},{"name":"IREINE","text":"(-Gods' Quiver Bow-)B-But, Commander! What about our motto: “All Ixal must die”?"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"Oh, they'll die all right! The minute they step their filthy feet back in the Twelveswood, I'll snap their twiggy wee necks and lap up their blood! Every clucking last one of them!"},{"name":"ISAUDOREL","text":"(-Gods' Quiver Bows-)Ma'am, yes, ma'am!"},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"Hmph... I did so want to push my claws into their beady little eyes, but it's not for me to put an end to what my master began."},{"name":"MIAHMOLKOT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>... You came to me with a letter, but in the end you brought me something far more important─true compassion, the legacy of my master that I was far too quick to forget.
