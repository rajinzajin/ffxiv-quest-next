According to the distressed Lalafell, Jihli has been denied her customary prophetic dream this year and thus the Dreamers have settled for arranging an egg hunt around town. The festival eggs in question, however, appear to have been stolen. Join forces with the Hatching–tide hunter near the Greatloam Growery, and see what can be done to save the celebrations.<br><br>※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone.","You meet with the Hatching–tide hunter, and launch an investigation into the missing eggs. Follow the festival cap-bedecked tracker's advice, and begin your search for clues in the vicinity of the Botanists' Guild.","You have uncovered several traces of the egg thief. Rendezvous with the Hatching–tide hunter, and deliver the material clues you recovered from the scene.","After reviewing the evidence at hand, the Hatching–tide hunter seems convinced that a spriggan is responsible for the missing festival eggs. Follow on the heels of your fellow investigator, and head in the direction the tracks appear to lead: the Yellow Serpent Gate.","You arrive at the Yellow Serpent Gate to find that the tracker has already captured a suspicious, egg-carrying spriggan. Even as you discuss the need for further interrogation, however, a Miqo'te mender arrives and vehemently insists that <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span> spriggan is innocent. Following a brief explanation of their own efforts to retrieve the stolen goods, the conjurer convinces you to guide “Riggy” on another foray into the true thief's lair. Speak with the Miqo'te mender again when you are ready to attempt her linkpearl strategy.","Thanks to your expert guidance, Riggy's raid on the spriggan lair is a resounding success. Take your spoils, and deliver them to the waiting Nonotta at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.","You make your egg delivery to Nonotta, and it seems at first that the case has been brought to a close. But while a spriggan was indeed responsible for spiriting away the eggs, the Hatching–tide hunter deduces that the true mastermind behind the events was none other than Jihli Aliapoh herself! Jihli happily confesses to the crime, and explains how her deceit was in fact inspired by one of her prophetic dreams. Recreating her vision this year is a door to unexpected encounters, and she would have your assistance in organizing the egg hunt which is to follow..."],"objectives":["Speak with the Hatching–tide hunter.","Search for traces of the egg thief.","Show the wiry black hair and shiny rock splinter to the Hatching–tide hunter.","Speak with the Hatching–tide hunter.","Speak with the Miqo'te mender and guide Riggy's efforts.","Deliver the armful of reclaimed eggs to Nonotta."],"dialogue":[{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Greetings, friend!

It all began with our founder─Jihli Aliapoh─and her prophetic dreams."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"We've found that recreating Jihli's yearly visions leads to the most delightful of celebrations. Decorating eggs is part of it, of course, but there is so much more─one of our egg collectors will be happy to give you the whole story."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, how wonderful to see you! Just in time to lend us a hand with the Hatching–tide festivities..."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"You <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> remember how it all works, don't you? Jihli's prophetic dreams? The egg decorating? The joyous laughter of child and adult alike?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Everything has been going to plan. ...Everything, that is, aside from one tiny, unexpected detail: the Dreamer has not had her dream this year!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Jihli herself seems unperturbed, and suggested we go ahead with hiding eggs around town for people to find."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"And an egg hunt is, of course, a perfectly enjoyable event all by itself. Thus did we straighten our egg caps, and turn our efforts to the preparations..."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"But now disaster has struck yet again! The eggs we so painstakingly crafted have been viciously and maliciously <span class=\"emphasis\">stolen</span>!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Please, adventurer! You must help us retrieve our Hatching–tide treasures!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Leave it to me!"},{"name":"A1","text":"If I must..."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Oh, thank you! Having a hero like you on the job could make all the difference!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Your cooperation is much appreciated. Having a hero like you on the job could make all the difference!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"And you won't be working alone─I've also secured the services of a talented tracker."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"If you head off right now, you should find her investigating the scene near the Greatloam Growery. She'll be the one shouldering a bow and wearing a decidedly fetching egg cap!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Nonotta sent you to help, did she? Good, I could use a second set of eyes."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"...<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, is it? You'll forgive me if I don't offer a name."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"When I accepted the job, Nonotta insisted I wear this ridiculous hat to be “in the spirit of things”...and I'd rather not have my colleagues hear about it. Ever."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"So if we happen to cross paths again in the future, you don't know me and I don't know you. Are we clear?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"...Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, it's you! And surely you remember me! Leih Aliapoh?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Ah, but maybe it would've been better had you forgotten. When I accepted the job, Nonotta insisted I wear this ridiculous hat. To be “in the spirit of things,” she said..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Let's keep this festive garb between the two of us, all right? If that thrice-damned Wildwood finds out, I'll never hear the end of it. And that means no talking about it back at the guild, either!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Right. Now that that's settled, we can focus on the task at hand."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"The eggs were apparently stored in a nearby hut. If we start from there and make our way down the path, we should find traces of the culprit."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Should you come across <span class=\"emphasis\">anything</span> out of the ordinary, bring it to me and I'll see if it has any relation to the crime. Let's catch ourselves an egg thief!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Did you try visiting the Greatloam Growery? Our tracker should still be there, suitably adorned in a festive egg cap!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You find a tuft of black hair caught on the edge of a broken plank. The strands are unusually thick and wiry. Might it have belonged to the egg thief...?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You spy a splinter of some shiny type of rock. Might this have something to do with the egg thief...?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You see evidence of someone passing through this area...but cannot tell who made the tracks."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"How fares your investigation? Any sign of our egg thief?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"We're fortunate this path has seen little passage. I can make out several distinct tracks..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Found some promising clues, have you? Let me have a closer look."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"We'll start with the shiny stone...<br>Hm, this seems to be a flake of mythril ore. Odd, since to the best of my knowledge, mythril deposits aren't naturally occurring in the Twelveswood."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Then we have this black tuft of...hair? Fur? It's awfully coarse. Considering where you found it, it may very well belong to the thief. Nice work!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Now it's my turn to share. If you look carefully, you'll notice the tracks on the ground here."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Oho, marked those for yourself already, did you? But what do they tell you? Aside from “someone passed this way,” of course."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"I can make out three distinct sets. From the size and gait, the first one was likely a female Miqo'te. The steps are deep and deliberate, thus I suspect they were made by Jihli when she came to place the eggs."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"As for the second set, they belong to a smaller-than-average Lalafell. Judging by the wide and random path of the steps, I believe they were made by a panicked Nonotta when she discovered the eggs had gone missing."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"The true mystery here lies with the third, and smallest, set of tracks. At first glance I considered a beastkin, but the creature obviously walks on two legs. Putting together the evidence thus far, would you hazard a guess as to who─or what─is our culprit?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"Who─or what─is the culprit?"},{"name":"A2","text":"It's a Lalafell!"},{"name":"A2","text":"It's a Miqo'te!"},{"name":"A2","text":"It's a spriggan!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Must you jest? Any Lalafell with feet that small and hair that wiry would be a terrifying sight to behold!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Are you making light of the situation? Or are you simply not listening? Either way, can we be serious for a moment here?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Ah, very good. I see the evidence at hand has led us to the same conclusion."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"...Our egg thief is almost certainly a spriggan. And whilst the motive is yet unclear, we at least have a suspect to chase."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"The spriggans of the Twelveswood lair in the Central Shroud...<br>Based on these tracks, the egg thief was very likely headed towards the Yellow Serpent Gate. Let's follow the spoor, shall we?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"You were a moment too late, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I spotted a spriggan cradling an egg and took him down with my bow!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"I didn't aim for anything vital, of course─we need him alive if we're to find out where he hid the rest of the eggs."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"(-???-)You have the wrong spriggan!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Oh, Riggy, my poor friend. Lie still, and I'll have you mended in a moment..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Your “poor friend”? Would you kindly explain what in the Matron's name is going on here?"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"From your actions, I assume the two of you are on the trail of the missing eggs?"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"As fortune would have it, Riggy and I witnessed the crime itself! We watched, aghast, even as an egg-laden spriggan joined others of his kin and made off with his Hatching–tide spoils!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"You were there!? But I was told there were no witnesses. And what's the story behind <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span> spriggan, then?"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Oh, Riggy here? This honorable and forthright soul pursued his brethren into their very lair, and escaped with one of the stolen treasures!"},{"name":"RIGGY","text":"Riggy is good spriggy! Bring back eggy!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Unfortunately, however, the trail leading into the spriggan nest is too narrow for folk of ordinary size. And that's not even considering the woodland monsters which lurk along the way. Apparently they gave Riggy quite a scare..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"What, so our only recourse is to encourage “Riggy” to make another foray on our behalf? We'd best say our farewells to those eggs..."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"...I have an idea! What if we furnish Riggy with a linkpearl? Then we can lend him support during his expedition─give advice on how to deal with monsters, cheer him on, that sort of thing!"},{"name":"RIGGY","text":"Riggy try again! Listen to shiny speakyyy!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"...Forgive me if I'm not filled with confidence. What say you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Let's give him a chance!"},{"name":"A3","text":"I don't know..."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I know he can do this!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Please, just give him a chance! I promise you, Riggy will give this his all!"},{"name":"RIGGY","text":"Riggy is readyyy! Jumpy, springy, and grab many eggyyy!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"I do believe we've restored Riggy's enthusiasm for the task. Now, if only I knew a little more about fighting mon─ Oh! You're an adventurer, aren't you? You should be in charge of the linkpearl!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The following controls can be used to navigate Egg Hunter Riggy (default settings):"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">space</span><span class=\"alternative\">Spacebar</span><span class=\"alternative\">A or move cursor left: Move Left<br>D or move cursor right: Move Right<br>[] or : Jump, Double Jump</span><span class=\"alternative\">[???]: Move Left<br>[???]: Move Right<br>[???] or [???]: Jump, Double Jump</span></span>"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Collect 15 or more eggs to win the game.

Take a deep breath, calm your mind, and we can try again!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Oh, look at all these eggs! Well done, you two!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Nice work, little one! I have to admit, I was wrong about you...and I'm sorry about the whole “shooting you with an arrow” thing, as well."},{"name":"RIGGY","text":"Riggy not angry! Riggy happy everyone happyyy!

I don't recall mentioning Nonotta's name."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Oh! Well, you see, I...I'm a good friend of hers! And this isn't the first time I've helped out with an egg hunt."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Ahem! Anyway, Riggy and I shall have another look around to see if we've missed any of those precious eggs! Fare you well, friends!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"That spriggan is an odd character, but it's the conjurer who makes my tail twitch. I suppose we have some good news for Nonotta, at least. Shall we?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"It seems we have no choice but to trust in this spriggan. And seeing as I, uh, put an arrow in him earlier, it might be best if you take the lead on this linkpearl strategy."},{"name":"RIGGY","text":"Riggy ride biggy rock! Riggy springy down!"},{"name":"RIGGY","text":"Riggy try again! Jumpy, springy, and grab many eggyyy!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Ah, there you are! I heard from our tracker friend that the eggs have been found! May I see them, please?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Yes, this is one I decorated myself! Thank you so very much!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Jihli, look! We have our eggs back!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"That's wonderful! We must have searched everywhere... Wherever did you find them?"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"...In a spriggan nest, you say!? So the culprit was a spriggan all along?"},{"name":"Q4","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A4","text":"Nay, 'twas a Lalafell!"},{"name":"A4","text":"Nay, 'twas a Miqo'te!"},{"name":"A4","text":"Aye, 'twas a spriggan!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Wha─? You've a strange sense of humor, friend, but I have to agree that the one responsible for this crime was no spriggan."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"...I see you share my suspicions."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Ah, well, that's true in part. But the spriggans were merely accomplices to the crime."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"There was a mastermind behind this entire affair..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Isn't that right, Jihli?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"You might be this festival's organizer, but I suspect you planned the theft from the start! The conjurer who so conveniently appeared to heal Riggy...that was you!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"...Clever girl!"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Yes, 'twas I who arranged for the eggs to “disappear.” But it was not my intent to deceive or distress you."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"You see, I actually <span class=\"emphasis\">did</span> have my prophetic dream this year. And the vision implied that if I hid the eggs myself, then the ensuing chain of events would lead to encounters both unexpected and wondrous."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"So everything that took place was an effort to recreate the details of your dream? No wonder you were so anxious to mend the spriggan's hurts..."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"I apologize for my trickery. But tell me, did you not enjoy meeting the charming Riggy, or the manner in which you recovered the lost eggs?"},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Speaking of which, there was a gift for you hiding inside one of the reclaimed treasures─a magical doll!
