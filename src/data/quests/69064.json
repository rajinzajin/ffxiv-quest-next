The inner reaches of the mine are said to be crawling with all manner of vicious cave dwellers, and the young miner is likely to have need of your protection.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Kee-Satt prepares to begin digging close to the former entrance to another section of the mine, now closed off following a cave-in a hundred years prior. Since reopening the tunnel is a task requiring a whole team of miners, he decides instead to pick away at the fallen rubble nearby for pieces of rutabite that might indicate the presence of a vein deeper within. As he sets to work, you will need to keep any aggressive creatures away from him, although the sound of his pickaxe may draw unwanted attention.","Thankfully, your first stint of keeping guard passes without incident. Kee-Satt's work, however, is far from over.","There is still no sign of any hostile creatures, though with boredom beginning to creep in, the appearance of a flesh-eating cave beast might serve as a welcome distraction.","Your patience is finally rewarded with the arrival of a ferocious denizen of the dark, intent on making you and Kee-Satt its next meal. The hapless creature soon lies at your feet in a crumpled heap while your friend continues his digging, blissfully unaware of the dangers you are facing on his behalf.","Kee-Satt's efforts have once again resulted in the discovery of a piece of ore that may or may not be the fabled rutabite. The only way to be sure is to return to Twine to have it examined.","Kee-Satt can barely contain his excitement when he reveals that not only did he discover rutabite, but that it is of sufficient purity to produce Nabaathium. The celebrations are cut short by the unwelcome arrival of the Ronso miners who had been harassing Kee-Satt earlier, and to the surprise of none, they resume hurling inane insults. The young Mystel refuses to take the bait, and instead requests their aid in clearing the way to the source of the rutabite. While they initially express reluctance to cooperate, they are nevertheless impressed by his sincerity and agree to join his venture. In the hope that Mystel and Ronso may once again work together for the good of Twine, Kee-Satt leads the way to the Dragging Tail, but not before offering you heartfelt words of appreciation for your loyalty and support."],"objectives":["Speak with Kee-Satt.","Stand watch at the specified location and defeat any enemies that appear.","Continue to stand watch at the specified location and defeat any enemies that appear.","Wait patiently at the specified location and defeat any enemies that appear.","Speak with Kee-Satt.","Speak with Kee-Satt again."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KEESATT","text":"According to Horthur, it's in the Dragging Tail, first left.

The tunnels don't seem to be in such a bad state considering there was once a cave-in nearby."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"The old section of the mine is past those wooden boards, but it's all fallen rubble now. If Horthur's story holds true, there should be a vein of rutabite on the other side, although I won't be attempting to reopen the tunnel all by myself."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"What I can do, though, is try cracking into a few of these rocks to see if they contain rutabite."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"I'll need you to keep an eye out for danger, though."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"Thanks. Hopefully it won't come to that. Anyway, I'd better get to work."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"The sound of my pickaxe might draw the attention of cave dwellers, so we'll need to be on our guard."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"There is no sign of danger. You had best continue to stand guard while Kee-Satt goes about his work."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"There is still no sign of danger."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"Oh, did something try to attack us? Sorry, I was too engrossed in my digging to notice."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"But thanks to you, I was able to concentrate on the task at hand and even found something that might be rutabite."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"After the last time, I now know better than to start jumping for joy until I've had someone look at it. I'll see you back in Twine."},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"There's good news and even better news!"},{"name":"KEESATT","text":"The good news is it's rutabite. The even better news is, it's almost entirely free of impurities! Finally, I can start making my own Nabaathium!"},{"name":"RONSOMINER03530","text":"What's this?

The point is, this is just a sample of what's in the collapsed section of the Dragging Tail.
