{"quest":{"name":"A Monk's Legacy","location":"Ul'dah","id":68747,"patch":5.0,"sort":800,"icon":100874,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1006749,"target":1006749,"genre":148,"journal":["A concerned Erik has a request for you.","Erik informs you that an Ala Mhigan Resistance soldier had come asking after Widargelt's whereabouts. Fearing that your brother monk may be dragged back on the path of vengeance, the professor bids you seek him out with all haste, and suggests that you try your luck in Ala Gannha.","You do not find Widargelt in Ala Gannha, but it appears he comes often to train the villagers. According to one, the monk had business in Little Ala Mhigo, and you strike out for Thanalan in pursuit.","You arrive in Little Ala Mhigo to find Widargelt standing before a grave─that of Adri, his closest friend turned foe. No sooner do you warn your brother monk that the Resistance is trying to find him than a soldier arrives. Revealed to be a member of Widargelt's old unit, the man invites his former captain to a meeting at Rhalgr's Reach. Widargelt accepts, and asks that you be present for the proceedings.","The meeting proves to be with none other than Lyse. In order to build a unified nation, she requests Widargelt's cooperation as a man of royal blood, but he declines, stating that he wishes to serve Ala Mhigo as a humble monk. Respecting his decision, Lyse instead asks Widargelt to train Resistance soldiers in the way of Fist of Rhalgr, and he happily agrees. At Widargelt's behest, the three of you then pay a visit to the Temple of the Fist. There, Lyse and Widargelt affirm that, though their paths may differ, their goals are one and the same. Satisfied that all is well, you set out back to Ul'dah, where Erik awaits.","Erik is pleased to learn that Widargelt's quest to revive the Fist of Rhalgr is proceeding apace. Thanking you for laying his fears to rest, he declares his intent to observe Widargelt and Lyse as they continue striving towards their goals."],"objectives":["Gather information on Widargelt in Ala Gannha.","Search for Widargelt in Little Ala Mhigo.","Join Widargelt in Rhalgr's Reach.","Report to Erik at the Goldsmiths' Guild."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ERIK","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, excellent timing. I have a request to ask of you. Worry not, it is a simple task that shan't overburden your simple mind."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"In no small part due to your valor, Ala Mhigo has won free of imperial tyranny, but something is afoot that gives me cause for concern."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"Not long ago, a soldier of the Resistance came asking after Widargelt's whereabouts."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"As you know, the buffoon was once a captain of the Resistance. And he had gathered under him like-minded men and women who burned with an all-consuming hatred for the Empire."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"While the inquiry may have been completely innocuous, we cannot discount the possibility that there are those who burn with hatred still. Who mean to drag Widargelt back on the path of vengeance."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"Though the Widargelt as we know him now would not lend such talk an ear, he may not be given a choice. Lest it turn ugly, I want to you to find your brother monk and alert him to the dangers."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"The last time we saw Widargelt was in Ala Gannha. If he isn't there still, the villagers may at least be able to direct you to him. Go quickly, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"SINCEREYOUNGMAN03211","text":"Wait, aren't you Master Widargelt's master?"},{"name":"SINCEREYOUNGMAN03211","text":"Looking for him, you say? He's not here at the moment, but he comes fairly often to train us."},{"name":"SINCEREYOUNGMAN03211","text":"Though he's a hard teacher, he inspires hard work. Thanks to his guidance, I was able to earn my cloth."},{"name":"SINCEREYOUNGMAN03211","text":"Right, his whereabouts. During his last visit, he said that he was going to Little Ala Mhigo next. If you hurry, he might still be there."},{"name":"DIGNIFIEDMAN03211","text":"&lt;gasp&gt; You're that monk from before! Ahhh, the way you laid the Corpse Brigade low was just glorious!"},{"name":"DIGNIFIEDMAN03211","text":"I wanted to become strong like you, so I went and joined the monkhood. Never once skipped training, I'm proud to say!"},{"name":"DIGNIFIEDMAN03211","text":"Master Widargelt? Last I spoke with him, he mentioned that he was trying to find Theobald."},{"name":"DIGNIFIEDMAN03211","text":"Fellow disappeared while under the healer's care. Someone saw him staggering out of the village in the early hours. Was headed west, by the sound of it."},{"name":"OPTIMISTICMAN03211","text":"Ah, yes, I remember you, friend. Is there something you need?"},{"name":"OPTIMISTICMAN03211","text":"Master Widargelt? He's been traveling around Eorzea, spreading the teachings of the monkhood."},{"name":"OPTIMISTICMAN03211","text":"He comes back to Ala Gannha from time to time to train our people, but I couldn't rightly say when he'll visit next."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"The last time we saw Widargelt was in Ala Gannha. If he isn't there still, the villagers may at least be able to direct you to him. Go quickly, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"OTCHAKHA","text":"Oh, Master Widargelt..."},{"name":"DZENTSA","text":"Gah, wish I knew what to say at times like this..."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>... I did not expect to see you here."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"This grave. Know you who lies here?"},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"It is the man who called himself Theobald. My closest brother, Adri."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"We had brought him to Ala Gannha for healing. But he fled in spite of his wounds. He looked like a hunted man. So do witnesses say."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"I do not believe that. Adri was not one to flee. He had used the Corpse Brigade. He knew they would come for him. Rather than wait, he went to them. And now he is gone."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"I wanted him to live. To stand at my side again. I...I should have done more."},{"name":"OTCHAKHA","text":"You tried your best to have him see the light, like you did for us."},{"name":"DZENTSA","text":"Aye. You mustn't be so hard on yourself."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Much has happened with you too, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sister</span><span class=\"alternative\">brother</span></span>. That much is plain. Come, let me hear your tale."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you talk about?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Lue-Reeq."},{"name":"A1","text":"A hunter who found his path."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"...So Lue-Reeq chose to sever ties with his kin."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"A resolve to which I can relate. I, too, chose my own path. Spurned blood in favor of faith."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Your part in this tale impresses me also. To do battle in a world flooded with light... Yet again I am reminded of your greatness."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Ah, but my apologies. You have traveled far. Is there something you require?"},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"A soldier of the Resistance seeks me? What could his purpose be?"},{"name":"DZENTSA","text":"You don't suppose they're coming after those of Theodoric's line?"},{"name":"OTCHAKHA","text":"It seems to me the Resistance would be above such acts. Yet I can offer no alternate explanation."},{"name":"RESISTANCEWARRIOR03211","text":"(-???-)Captain! It has been a while, sir!"},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"You... It has been a while indeed. But I am no one's captain. I have long left the Resistance."},{"name":"RESISTANCEWARRIOR03211","text":"Forgive me, sir, but old habits. It's hard to regard you as anything save my esteemed captain."},{"name":"RESISTANCEWARRIOR03211","text":"But if that is not your preference─Master Widargelt, may I ask you to accompany me to Rhalgr's Reach? There is a matter we wish to discuss with you."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Is that so?"},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Very well, then. Lead the way."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"D'zentsa, O'tchakha, please wait here. I will return anon."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, may I ask you to join me?"},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"You are well regarded in the Resistance. Your presence would give me heart. "},{"name":"RESISTANCEWARRIOR03211","text":"Without further ado, then, let us be away."},{"name":"SINCEREYOUNGMAN03211","text":"During his last visit, Master Widargelt said that he was going to Little Ala Mhigo next. If you hurry, he might still be there."},{"name":"DIGNIFIEDMAN03211","text":"Master Widargelt was trying to find Theobald. Fellow disappeared while under the healer's care.

Thank you for coming all this way."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!? Don't tell me you know Master Widargelt!?"},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> is a dear comrade. I owe <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> much and more."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Well, that makes it easier, then! To get right to the heart of the matter, Master Widargelt, we wish to invite you to rejoin the Resistance."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Under the mad king and then the Garleans, the people of Ala Mhigo lived in crippling fear and mutual mistrust."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"In rebuilding the nation, we want to create a place where folk can believe in and support one another. A place where everyone is regarded as a friend."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Even those who are kin to the mad king?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We should've reached out to you earlier, I know. But we feared that doing so would incite those who plotted a return to the old rule."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"It's quite all right, Commander. I know your intent is good and true."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"However, I cannot rejoin the Resistance. I would serve my nation as a humble monk. This I have sworn to myself."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"A man named Theodred never existed. There was ever only Widargelt. And he wishes to restore that which was once lost. The teachings of the Fist of Rhalgr."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I see... Then you must do what your heart tells you."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Let's try this again. I put this request to Widargelt of the Fist of Rhalgr."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I want you to train the soldiers of the Resistance. Though we've won our freedom, we must be prepared to fight to keep it, and I believe that your techniques would serve us well."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I've never trained properly myself, and for what it's worth I'm very keen to learn."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"And I should be honored to teach."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Great! We're in your debt!"},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"If I might make a request of my own... May I visit the Temple of the Fist? I would pay my respects."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Of course! You hardly need my permission for that."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Come on, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, let's all go together."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Being here brings back memories. I remember the high priests. My brother and sister monks. All of them gone now. In fire and smoke."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"But you survived, like the temple's stout stones. And thanks to your efforts, the faith has begun to rise from the ashes."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Not my efforts alone. All I have achieved, I owe to many others. Professor Erik. D'zentsa and O'tchakha. And not least of all, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I couldn't have come this far on my own either. Like you, I had dear comrades to prop me up and push me forward."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"And I'll never stop forging on─for Ala Mhigo!"},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"Our paths may differ. But our goals are one and the same. There is no more need for words."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, the professor worries for me. Please return to him. Let him know that all is well."},{"name":"WIDARGELT","text":"I was instructed to wait here. What could it be that they wish to discuss...?"},{"name":"DZENTSA","text":"Hold the fort, D'zentsa. Never do anything fun, D'zentsa."},{"name":"OTCHAKHA","text":"Please take care of Master Widargelt."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"Ah, you are returned. Were you able to find Widargelt?"},{"name":"ERIK","text":"I see. I'm pleased to hear that his effort to revive the Fist of Rhalgr proceeds apace. Of course, it will still take considerable time for the faith to take root across the land, but Widargelt is young and determined. The day will come when he realizes his dream."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"But to think that it was none other than Curtis Hext's daughter that sought him out..."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"A woman who embraces her lineage and a man who rejects his... Viewed thus, their paths could not be more different, but as they have discovered, their goals are one and the same. Ala Mhigo is stronger for their cooperation."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"In any case, it appears my concerns were unfounded. My thanks for laying my fears to rest."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"For a while, though, I believe I will observe these two souls in their future endeavors."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"After all, I am nothing if not observant."}],"reward":{"gil":3645,"items":[{"id":25187},{"id":25188},{"id":25189}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":21}],"questsType":"all","quests":[67966,68814]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006749","obj":{"i":1006749,"n":"Erik","l":41,"q":9}},{"type":"item","id":"25187","obj":{"i":25187,"n":"Heavens' Eye Materia VII","l":420,"c":20274,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":6,"value":8,"attr":"Direct Hit Rate","category":0}}},{"type":"item","id":"25188","obj":{"i":25188,"n":"Savage Aim Materia VII","l":420,"c":20274,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":6,"value":8,"attr":"Critical Hit","category":0}}},{"type":"item","id":"25189","obj":{"i":25189,"n":"Savage Might Materia VII","l":420,"c":20274,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":6,"value":8,"attr":"Determination","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"67966","obj":{"i":67966,"n":"The Power to Protect","g":148,"l":"The Peaks","s":700,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68814","obj":{"i":68814,"n":"Courage Born of Fear","g":181,"l":"Kholusia","s":351,"f":1}}]}
