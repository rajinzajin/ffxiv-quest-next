As this will be his first time meeting her, he has requested that you accompany him there.","The ship Kikimo has come on is too small to transport all the Confederacy goods back to Kugane. As such, she must return once to the port city and bring back a larger vessel. Tsukikage suggests meeting at the far north of Sakazuki to ensure the transaction goes through smoothly. To prepare for her arrival, he would have Hansaku clear the northern area of wild beasts while Suzume rests at the guardroom to recover from her pearl-diving injuries and he and you see that the goods make it safely to the other side of the island.","As Tsukikage is having his men load up the goods to transport them to the other side of the island, he notices that one of the items is missing─the crimson-shell ring. He suspects it has been stolen and would like for you to fetch Suzume that she might assist him in tracking down the thief. To find her, with the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase that contains the name “Suzume” at the designated location.","While you fail to find Suzume, your calls attract the attention of one of the other pirates. He tells you that Suzume ran off to Hells' Lid to meet Hansaku, with a ring on her finger. It may be prudent to inform Tsukikage of this turn of events.","Upon rechecking the inventory list, Tsukikage realizes the crimson-shell ring that went missing had been made by Suzume's parents. He suspects the fake merchants they tossed into the sea may have had a hand in the village raid that led to her parents' deaths. Knowing that Hansaku was once involved with them, Tsukikage reasons Suzume has gone to Hells' Lid not to help him but to get revenge."],"objectives":["Speak with Kikimo at Sakazuki.","Speak with Tsukikage at Sakazuki.","With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, enter “Suzume” to call out to the pirate.","Report to Tsukikage."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HANSAKU","text":"Diving for pearls should have been but child's play to Suzume. Perhaps, however, things didn't go so smoothly and that put her in a foul mood..."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"While it is true that we are banned from setting foot in Kugane, there is no such law prohibiting Mistress Kikimo from coming to us. Therefore, we shall be meeting with her at Sakazuki."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Hansaku, I would like for you to accompany Suzume and assist her in transporting our goods there. You are then to unload them and bring them to our rendezvous point. Understood?"},{"name":"HANSAKU","text":"You got it, Chief!"},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, this shall be my first time meeting Mistress Kikimo, and I would like to have you accompany me. I shall be counting on you to introduce us."},{"name":"KIKIMO","text":"I was just about to depart for Sakazuki. If you worry for my safety, there is no need. I have been on a hundred more voyages in the past moon alone than most have in their entire lives."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"This must be Mistress Kikimo? Well, will you be introducing us or must I do it myself?"},{"name":"SUZUME","text":"Excuse me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but I am not feeling very well. &lt;groan&gt; I do not think I can talk right now."},{"name":"HANSAKU","text":"My respect for Suzume grows by the day!

Before we turn everything over to you, please first allow me to present you with these..."},{"name":"KIKIMO","text":"...A decade-old turtle shell, teardrop pearls, and soaring shark fins? I did not think you would be able to procure these things on such short notice! Added to that, each and every one of these items is in pristine condition. For your exceptional service, I am inclined to give you a bonus."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Thank you. As for the rest of the goods─we can turn those over to you at your earliest convenience."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"There is quite a lot so I imagine you will need a merchant vessel to transport them back. I assume, however, sailing such a large ship into this area might attract the attention of the bakufu?"},{"name":"KIKIMO","text":"Yes, and were they to catch us dealing with members of the Confederacy, the consequences could be dire."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Then let us complete this transaction on the northern side of our island. Once you return with a larger ship, we can load everything up there, out of the reach of the prying eyes of the Hingan soldiers at the Ruby Price."},{"name":"KIKIMO","text":"An excellent idea. I shall return to Kugane and have a mercantile ship prepared for departure. Master Tsukikage, I will be leaving you here. Till we meet again at Sakazuki's northern tip."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"There is one other matter we must attend to before Mistress Kikimo returns with her ship. While hidden from prying eyes, the northern reaches are infested with beasts. They must be slain."},{"name":"HANSAKU","text":"Leave it to me, Chief! I will make sure that the area is cleared of any dangers!"},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Very good."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Suzume, would you please accompany Hansaku?"},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Suzume? Are you listening to me? Please go with Hansaku and secure the northern area of the island."},{"name":"SUZUME","text":"...Ah, yes, sir. But before that, please allow me to take a short rest at the guardroom. The injuries I sustained while diving for pearls have taken quite a toll on me."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"I had not realized you were injured. Yes. Take a rest, then. I have already sent word ahead to the guardroom requesting those there to lend us their assistance. Upon your arrival, tell them that they are to meet us at the trading spot."},{"name":"SUZUME","text":"Yes, sir. I will be sure to do that."},{"name":"HANSAKU","text":"There is no need for that, Chief. I can take care of everything on my own!"},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"I cannot put my finger on it, but something about Suzume is off. The dark, angry look she has when she thinks no one is looking─it reminds me of the expression she wore when she first joined the Confederacy."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"It was right after she lost her parents to a raid upon her small fishing village. She was one of the few that survived. I remember so clearly how broken she was..."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Well, whatever it is, it will have to wait until our delivery is complete.

Keep shouting, and I will be forced to take you into custody."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Suzume"},{"name":"SAILOR02689","text":"You are looking for Suzume, I take it? Well, you will have no luck finding her here. She has long since gone to help clear the meeting area of beasts."},{"name":"SAILOR02689","text":"Originally, I was to go with Hansaku, but she insisted on taking my place."},{"name":"SAILOR02689","text":"When Suzume left wearing a pearl ring, it became immediately obvious what was going on! She and Hansaku are having an <span class=\"emphasis\">affair</span>! Gahahaha!"},{"name":"SAILOR02689","text":"I simply cannot wait for them to return!

Nothing about this story sits right with me."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Suzume often openly scorns Hansaku. Added to that I cannot bring myself to believe she would steal from us. Even if she did, she is not foolish enough to flaunt her loot."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Someone must have made a mistake while reviewing the inventory list. Yes, that's it. I shall survey everything once more, and that will clear up this whole misunderstanding."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Hold on. It says here that the allegedly stolen item is a Kaisuri ring. ...Ah, the pieces of the puzzle have finally fallen into place."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"Kaisuri is Suzume's last name. Her parents made shell jewelry for a living. All of their work bears their signature─including the crimson-shell ring."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"One of the thugs we apprehended earlier was wearing this. That means, there is a chance he had a hand in the raid that took her parents' lives and might even be personally responsible for their deaths."},{"name":"TSUKIKAGE","text":"This bodes ill. Hansaku─he was once a part of their crew, which means... Damn it, Suzume! Do not tell me you would be foolish enough to attempt to get revenge."}],"reward":{"gil":1300,"items":[{"num":3,"id":5668}],"xp":91800},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":62,"id":34}],"questsType":"all","quests":[68017,68224]},"next":[68226]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1022106","obj":{"i":1022106,"n":"Tsukikage","l":2409,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022110","obj":{"i":1022110,"n":"Tsukikage","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019049","obj":{"i":1019049,"n":"Kikimo","l":2404,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022105","obj":{"i":1022105,"n":"Loud-mouthed Pirate","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022108","obj":{"i":1022108,"n":"Hansaku","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023481","obj":{"i":1023481,"n":"Suzume","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023484","obj":{"i":1023484,"n":"Tsukikage","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023485","obj":{"i":1023485,"n":"Hansaku","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023488","obj":{"i":1023488,"n":"Kikimo","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"5668","obj":{"i":5668,"n":"Heavens' Eye Materia V","l":160,"c":20258,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Direct Hit Rate","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68017","obj":{"i":68017,"n":"Alisaie's Stones","g":6,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":360}},{"type":"quest","id":"68224","obj":{"i":68224,"n":"Unfinished Business","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":2160}},{"type":"quest","id":"68226","obj":{"i":68226,"n":"Family Affairs","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":2180}}]}
