That way you can have an undiluted experience with the resident terrors."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"These marks on your map are where the usual trouble spots are."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"You can assume that any beast with a white hide or carapace is a sin eater, but you'll know for sure soon enough when they come slavering after your aether. Remember: it's kill or be killed with these monsters."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Once you've slain whatever's prowling around out there, we can rendezvous back at the north entrance. Good hunting."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"How did you fare?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Ah, I thought there might be one or two lurking on the fringes. Nothing out of the ordinary for this area..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I expect you noticed it yourself, but individually, these lesser sin eaters are no more deadly than any natural predator you might encounter in the desert."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It's when they appear in numbers that they pose a threat. Much like the voidsent, they have an unfortunate tendency to flock to the strongest of their kind."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Thus when a powerful sin eater goes on the hunt, it might be attended by a veritable swarm of weaker kin. Imagine an army of such creatures descending on a village or hamlet..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"That's the basic idea behind my patrols: to cull their ranks often enough that their numbers won't be overwhelming when the big ones come out to play. And you've certainly helped on that front."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Let's report our victories to Tesleen, shall we?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"She hasn't been telling you stories, has she? Oh gods..."},{"name":"TESLEEN","text":"Alisaie tells me you helped out on her patrol. You have our thanks...and my apologies for leading you from one battle to another ever since the moment we met!"},{"name":"TESLEEN","text":"In any case, I'm glad to see the two of you found each other. You have no idea how badly Alisaie has missed your company!

And I don't sound like that, either! I was simply trying to view matters from another perspective, and I <span class=\"emphasis\">respect</span> <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s methods!"},{"name":"TESLEEN","text":"Ahahaha! Honestly, after seeing <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> in action, I can understand why."},{"name":"TESLEEN","text":"The way <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> leaps into the fray without hesitation, it really is something to behold. I might be a little smitten myself!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"&lt;gasp&gt;"},{"name":"TESLEEN","text":"Heh heh! I'm only teasing!
