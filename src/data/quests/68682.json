I always wanted to see it... &lt;sigh&gt;"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"In the field of aetherology, the Azim Steppe remains unbroken ground. Having missed your last expedition through injury, I mean to seize this opportunity with both hands."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"The reigning Ruby Princess is more receptive to the outside world than her predecessor, it is true─but what we offer is an invitation to war. Though I will plead our case, I fear we can expect little of Sui-no-Sato."},{"name":"HAKURO","text":"We have fought long and sacrificed much to reclaim our freedom. I will die before I allow the Empire to take it from us again."},{"name":"KIENKANGATEKEEPER03028","text":"Lord Hien is expecting you. May I show you in?"},{"name":"EVENTAREA","text":"Enter the Kienkan?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"It is settled, then. I will journey to the Azim Steppe with the Scions. Yugiri and Hakuro─I leave our other neighbors to you."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"My apologies, but I won't be joining you."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I am no aetherologist, and what skills I do possess are unlikely to be of any great use to the mission. But more importantly, it seems to me that the ruins in the Burn warrant attention."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And so, while you are away securing an energy source, I will engage our friends at Garlond Ironworks to undertake a complete overhaul of the field generators. We'll need them in good working order if our plan is to succeed. I trust there are no objections?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Have care in the Burn."},{"name":"A1","text":"Come on, Alisaie... Could you not get Tataru to do it?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Have care on the Steppe! From what I hear, the Xaela like fighting with friends almost as much as foes. Good luck!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Hm! I'm sure she'd love the Burn. Joking aside, I <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span> planning to enlist her help with organizing everything─but we'll still need a Scion on the ground. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll manage without me. Good luck!"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Just the three of us, then. Very well. Shall we make first for Reunion?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"'Tis a fine feeling to be back. Were it not for our mission, I would like nothing more than to lie on the grass and watch the clouds float by..."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Greetings, my friend. If you are looking for Mistress Tataru, she has left with Mistress Alisaie to speak with the good people of Garlond Ironworks."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"So this is the Azim Steppe... The tales do not do it justice."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"If you think the view is impressive here, wait until we reach higher ground."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Actually...seeing as it's your first visit, permit me to show you my favorite spot."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"An intriguing myth...though I wonder how Nhaama came to be woven into it. An Allagan hand, perhaps?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"From here, we shall travel to Mol Iloh. There we may ask Cirina about the particulars of the myth, and raise the matter of an alliance with the rulers of the Steppe."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Tell me─do you notice anything different about the Mol? How they carry themselves? That, my friend, is pride. I do believe their victory in the Naadam meant more to them than I realized."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"So that is Cirina. Lyse told me something of the woman, but I did not think that we would ever have occasion to meet."},{"name":"TEMULUN","text":"Strange... Amidst the radiance of your being, I sense a shadow. I pray it is but my imagination."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Hien, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I am glad of your visit, and the opportunity to welcome a new friend. How may we serve you?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"There is a matter I would discuss with the Mol. It concerns not only the peoples of the Steppe, but of every land in the Far East."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"A shard of the shining moon left behind by a wayfaring soul... And you need this to protect our lands?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"I do. My friends and I wish to find the shard and ascertain the extent of its power. Will you tell me more of the place where it lies buried? This “northern crag”?"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"...If that is your wish. In the mountains to the north, there is a cavern called the House of the Crooked Coin. Inside this cavern are pillars of stone that legend holds to be the source of Nhaama's power. There, I believe, you will find what you seek."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Ah, yes, I know the place. 'Tis a brisk walk from here. And what are your thoughts on an alliance?"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Should the Empire return, our lands will be engulfed in a storm of conflict whether we will it or no. If we do not stand together, we will fall apart. This I believe with all my heart. However..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"...However?"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Among the tribes of the Steppe, there are those who revere Nhaama above all else. To them, the pillars are sacred, and not to be disturbed."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Should you proceed as you propose, such tribes are like to spurn an alliance, prompting others to follow their example. That is my concern."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"But it is by no means certain that the pillars will provide the power you seek. Ere you risk the ire of the followers of Nhaama, might you not first visit the House of the Crooked Coin? If all is as you hope, we may then consider how best to earn their blessing."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"I thank you for your counsel. We will do as you suggest. I have no desire to give offense to those with whom I would join hands."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Thank you for your understanding. Though the Mol may reign over the Steppe today, this decision will shape the days to come, and we would not force others into war against their will."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Nor we. A hundredfold stronger are they who choose to fight of their own accord."}],"reward":{"gil":1054,"items":[{"id":24274,"one":1},{"id":24279,"one":1},{"id":24280,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":5825,"one":1}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":142}],"quests":[68681]},"next":[68683]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1025597","obj":{"i":1025597,"n":"Hien","l":2847,"q":7}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020539","obj":{"i":1020539,"n":"Cirina","l":2411,"q":7}},{"type":"item","id":"24274","obj":{"i":24274,"n":"Rooibos Tea","l":370,"c":24412,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"24279","obj":{"i":24279,"n":"Salmon Muffin","l":370,"c":24025,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"24280","obj":{"i":24280,"n":"Shakshouka","l":370,"c":24262,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"5825","obj":{"i":5825,"n":"Allagan Silver Piece","l":25,"c":26001,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"68681","obj":{"i":68681,"n":"Shadows in the Empire","g":7,"l":"The Doman Enclave","s":29}},{"type":"quest","id":"68683","obj":{"i":68683,"n":"The Will of the Moon","g":7,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":31}}]}
