Wishing to know how things stand in the sultanate prior to any rescue attempt, he has arranged to meet with the Admiral, and bids you join him. Make your way to Bulwark Hall on Limsa Lominsa's lower decks and speak with Storm Sergeant Zanthael to be admitted to the Bridge.","Merlwyb informs you that Raubahn has been moved to an unknown location ahead of his impending execution─by none other than the Crystal Braves. Since word of this troubling development arrived, the shinobi of Doma have been frantically gathering intelligence on the Flame General's whereabouts, and the Admiral bids you seek out her Doman contact, a female frontier hand currently working in a kitchen at Revenant's Toll.","The Doman contact is revealed to be Higiri. During the ill-fated victory feast, members of the Crystal Braves seized the Rising Stones by force, but she and a number of her compatriots were able to escape. Grateful for the kindness the Scions showed to them, the Domans stand ready to aid in Raubahn's rescue."],"objectives":["Speak with Zanthael on the lower decks of Limsa Lominsa.","Speak with the Doman contact at Revenant's Toll."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Though the situation calls for urgency, it would avail us little to charge headlong into Ul'dah without a plan. Before we can formulate a plan, however, we must first learn how things stand in the sultanate─which is why I propose that we visit Limsa Lominsa."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Aye, you heard me right. While you were about your altruistic endeavors, I acted as an intermediary in trade negotiations between House Fortemps and a Lominsan consortium. During said negotiations, an opportunity to send word to the Admiral presented itself, and I duly seized it."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I am happy to report that we yet have a stout ally in Limsa. The Admiral has pledged her full cooperation in any effort to rescue Raubahn."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Accordingly, I have agreed to meet with her, that we might discuss how best to proceed.
