Report indicates that invasive plant life threatens harvest. Be aware that there is a perfectly good, pre-synthesized compound available to eliminate all traces of organic life from the applied area with a minimum of effort."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"However, the disheveled manager objected quite shrilly to its use. They insist on a weaker chemical agent, which must be produced at great expense from nearby materials. Although this is an inefficient course of action, engaging in debate with diminutive life-forms is projected to be equally taxing."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"Therefore, your task is to mine sodium-rich ore from the Elysian fields. Please do not argue with this directive."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"Therefore, your task is to gather local grain from the Elysian fields. Please do not argue with this directive."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"Therefore, your task is to procure one of the many fish from the waters of the agricultural sector. The use of gold salmon roe is recommended to speed your work along. Highly recommended."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"Deliver the ingredients to the Karellian at Base Omicron. There they will waste precious moments synthesizing the inferior chemical agent."},{"name":"KARELEAN04607","text":"Ah, you must be Stigma-4's <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span>. I understand you have a delivery for us."},{"name":"KARELEAN04607","text":"Yes, this will do perfectly. Finally we'll be rid of those weeds. "},{"name":"KARELEAN04607","text":"They're a threat not only to the harvest itself, but to the beliefs our people hold dear. Do you recall the rounded glyph at the heart of our fields? It is an ancient symbol of good fortune, passed down by our forebears. It seems the local flora have no respect for tradition, however."},{"name":"KARELEAN04607","text":"We must keep it free from obstruction, lest we forget its message: that our scientific zeal led to our destruction, and only by returning to the old ways did we find life anew. Now, I'd best get started mixing these ingredients."},{"name":"KARELEAN04607","text":"Ah, a resupply is always welcome! Thanks to you, the symbol remains visible as a reminder to all and sundry. Not to mention that our harvest is more bountiful than ever before!"},{"name":"KARELEAN04607","text":"The vegetables we grow have proven to be in high demand, and we mustn't disappoint our customers. It gives value to every drop of sweat we shed."},{"name":"KARELEAN04607","text":"I shall make more of the chemical solution as soon as time allows. However, the weeds are a constant menace, and doubtless we shall require more ingredients before long."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"Return of allied life-form <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> confirmed. Report from Base Omicron indicates successful production of the chemical agent."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"Scanning database for records of Karellian civilization... &lt;ping&gt; Glyphs like the one at the Karellian agricultural facility are colloquially known as “crop circles.” They were created by a number of primitive cultures as a form of “artistic expression.”"},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"The belief that such symbols are a catalyst for good fortune is categorized as “nonsense.” However, the glyph's positive effect on worker morale and the flow of dynamis bears further analysis."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"Analysis indicates that the rich harvest is merely a statistical aberration, and not a direct consequence of the crop circle. Yet its continued positive effect on morale─in defiance of all logic─cannot be denied, so its upkeep is worth the cost of resources and time."},{"name":"STIGMA4","text":"You will be summoned once more should the need for help arise. May your wages tide you over until then."}],"reward":{"gil":655,"reputation":60,"items":[{"id":37854},{"id":6141}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":3,"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":32}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1043417","obj":{"i":1043417,"n":"Stigma-4","l":3712,"q":28}},{"type":"item","id":"37854","obj":{"i":37854,"n":"Omicron Omnitoken","l":1,"c":"t/65095","t":100}},{"type":"item","id":"6141","obj":{"i":6141,"n":"Cordial","l":25,"c":20622,"t":44}}]}
