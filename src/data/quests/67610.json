Seek out Jeweled Peak, who awaits nearby, and deliver to her the star sapphire music box.","You safely deliver the twin music boxes to husband and wife, who─while impressed with their beauty─are concerned that they have, unbeknownst to each other, prepared identical anniversary gifts.

As Serendipity and Master Colbernoux look on, the loving couple is near moved to tears as they place the two music boxes side by side to hear the two arrangements come together to produce a variation on their favorite melody like none they have heard before. Truly, you have given form to the formless and breathed a beating heart into metal.
