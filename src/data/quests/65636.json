Follow the rest of the Doman Adventurers' Guild to where she is hiding near the southeast gate of Revenant's Toll.","Koharu has found the cart and two of your four suspects. However, this brings up the question of how to prove the criminals' guilt. After a stroke of brilliance, Yozan and Rokka put on a show for the two Lalafells. They pretend that the stolen grimoire contains the location of a hidden treasure. Suitably persuaded, the two suspects run off. Meet with Yozan to the east of Camp Revenant's Toll in hopes of heading off the criminals.","Hiding in a gully, you watch as four Lalafells wander towards the camp, the stolen grimoire in hand. You and the Doman Adventurers' Guild rush towards them, revealing that the tale of treasure was all merely a ploy. In a fit of pique, the leader, Gagarua, calls for his allies to teach you a lesson. Speak with him, and defeat his henchmen should they attack you.","You successfully fend off Gagarua's gang. Now speak with the man himself, and see if he will come quietly.","Upon realizing who you are, Gagarua calls his allies to him, and summons something down upon you from the skies. By the time you realize that this was all a trick, the criminals have run away. However, they have left the aged grimoire in their haste. Retrieve this valuable piece of evidence now.","You have retrieved the grimoire from where it was left. Show it now to Yozan.","Yozan is happy that you now have the means to clear the name of the Doman Adventurers' Guild, and bids you present the aged grimoire to Slafborn back in Revenant's Toll forthwith.","Slafborn gratefully accepts the stolen grimoire, and listens to your tale exonerating the children. Yozan makes it clear that they are all adventurers now, and Slafborn agrees with the hint of a smile on his lips. He watches as the children run away, presumably to find some new quest, and asks that you guide them with a gentle hand, and protect them with your strong arm."],"objectives":["Speak with Koharu.","Speak with Yozan.","Speak with Gagarua and defeat his henchmen.","Speak with Gagarua.","Pick up the aged grimoire.","Speak with Yozan.","Deliver the aged grimoire to Slafborn."],"dialogue":[{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">Mister</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, Koharu's found our suspects!"},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"They've parked their cart around the southeast gate.
