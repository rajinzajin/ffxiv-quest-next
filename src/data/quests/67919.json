{"quest":{"name":"Who Was That Masked Man","location":"The Churning Mists","id":67919,"patch":3.5,"sort":2,"icon":100601,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1017320,"target":1011907,"involved":[1011916,1011928,1017170,1018239,1018240,1018241,1018242,1018243,1018244],"genre":63,"journal":["Master Mogzin is a moogle with a plan.","With all parties having agreed to put aside their petty differences to address the grave matter of the madness that has taken Gullinbursti, Master Mogzin has decided on a plan of action. While he and Ohl Deeh gather information about Gullinbursti's current whereabouts, you and the deftarm will pursue the mysterious masked assailant in hopes of gaining insight as to what precisely is afflicting the ancient dragon, and how he might be returned to his benevolent self. At the deftarm's suggestion, you split up to question the residents of Bahrr Lehs regarding aught they may have seen or heard.","A Temple Knight with a disturbingly nonchalant attitude to these troublesome developments informs you that the masked man had personally asked him where he might find a dragon of particular puissance, in response to which the hapless fool unwittingly volunteered his knowledge of Gullinbursti. The full implications of this remain a mystery, but mayhap the deftarm has gleaned some new information that will serve to shed light on the whole affair.","The deftarm is not entirely sure what to make of the testimony you gathered, but reveals that in the meantime he has learned that your quarry has already moved on from the Churning Mists. He proposes that you return to the surface together, and seek the wisdom of the storyteller at Loth ast Vath before continuing on in your pursuit.","You make your way to Loth ast Vath, but the deftarm is nowhere to be seen. While confident that your pupil has not been led astray by the whispers of the Onemind as he had in the past, the storyteller nevertheless fears for his fellow Vath's safety. You strike out for the hinterlands with the hope that nothing dire has befallen your friend.","You sigh in relief to see that the deftarm is safe, and had merely taken a detour to rescue the goblin lass Drydox from an ambush by the Onemind. Your loyal apprentice bears troubling news, however, as he relates that the assailants set upon the girl with a cruel, crazed savagery entirely uncharacteristic of the highly regimented Gnath. When Drydox then reveals that she heard gunshots shortly prior to the attack, the deftarm makes the obvious connection: the masked man responsible for Gullinbursti's madness is surely close at hand. Identifying his destination as the forest, you plot a course for Tailfeather to consult with the hunter Marcechamp.","Marcechamp, much to his own chagrin, is keenly familiar with the masked man you pursue. He explains that he is an adventurer of ill repute and renown, known far and wide for accepting all manner of nefarious assignments and seeing them through with lethal precision. When the deftarm restates his resolve, undeterred by these grave warnings, the hunter relents and shares his knowledge of your quarry's whereabouts. Promising your determined pupil that you will only intercede if absolutely necessary, together you strike out for the Convictory in the western highlands of Coerthas.","You arrive at the Convictory to see that Jantellot, too, has had an inopportune encounter with the notorious masked marauder, having lost his prized manacutter─and very nearly, one of his prized men─at the villain's hand. While making it clear that this is not an opponent to be trifled with, he does not begrudge you information regarding where the man might be found, in hopes that you and the deftarm might be able to bring the man to justice. In the face of increasingly worrisome reports on the masked man and the full threat that he poses, your apprentice remains undaunted, and as his master, you resolve to stick by his side until the job is through."],"objectives":["Ask around about the masked man at Bahrr Lehs.","Report to the deftarm.","Speak with the Vath storyteller at Loth ast Vath.","Search for the Vath deftarm at the Smoldering Wastes.","Speak with Marcechamp.","Speak with Jantellot at the Convictory."],"dialogue":[{"name":"OHLDEEH","text":"The madness in those eyes...that was not the Gullinbursti I know!

I had not until now, and...I am scared."},{"name":"MOGZIN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I would beseech the aid of you and your deft-armed disciple, kupo. Pray pursue this masked marauder, and find out the truth behind the madness that has taken Gullinbursti!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Now <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span> is a task worthy of an adventurer! Mark my words, my moogle friend─Master and I will track down this mysterious and dangerous foe!"},{"name":"MOGZIN","text":"A thousand thank-yous, kupo! Might I suggest that you start by asking around here in Bahrr Lehs? Perhaps some of them have heard or seen something of the man we seek."},{"name":"MOGZIN","text":"As for myself and Ohl Deeh, we will see what we might learn about Gullinbursti's current whereabouts. Tarresson, might I trouble you to watch over the plaza while we are away?"},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"You would suggest that a greybeard like myself can offer naught else to your cause? Ohoho, but I jest. Rest assured that you will find not a single stone out of place on your return. Go in safety, friend Mogzin!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"At last, Master, a task worthy of our skills! Let us split up, see what we can learn about this masked villain. I shall question the moogles in this area. Would you be so kind as to speak to those gathered around the fountain? We can meet up here when our tasks are done. Share what we have learned."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Have you spoken to the moogles and knights around the fountain? As for me, my own investigation is still in progress. Let us meet up here when we have learned all there is to learn."},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"In my younger days, I would have been ill content to stay behind while my companions were out adventuring, but today? These old bones could use a respite, and between you and this deftarm, Mogzin and Ohl Deeh, I know that the matter is in capable hands."},{"name":"MOG02383","text":"D-Did I see a masked man, you ask? Did I ever, kupo! He strolled in brandishing that fearsome firearm of his and started picking off lesser dragons left and right!

If you're going after him, I'd encourage you to be very, <span class=\"emphasis\">very</span> careful. I don't know what he's up to, but I can assure you it's no good, kupo!"},{"name":"KOUHEI02383","text":"A masked man? Sure, I saw him. Exchanged a few words with him, for that matter.

S-Say it's a promise...pretty please, kupo?"},{"name":"KOUHEI02383","text":"Everyone in these parts knows Gullinbursti. If I hadn't been the one to tell the masked man, he would have found out from one of my colleagues in due time. If anything, I saved them the trouble and anguish of being the one responsible. Surely you agree?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; ...I see. So it would seem this masked marauder set his sights on Gullinbursti for his power and puissance. Interesting. Very interesting!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"From my own questionings, I have learned that our quarry has since been sighted in Sohm Al. It would seem he has already left the Churning Mists behind. We must give chase, yes, and return to the surface!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"On the way, I would pay a brief visit to Loth ast Vath. I would share this news with the storyteller, and see what wisdom he might share with us. And with that, let us see whose legs are faster─I shall race you there, Master!"},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; The deftarm? I have not seen him. Could it be that the Onemind once again calls out to him? But no. Even were it so, that one's mind has grown too strong. Still, I worry. Pray find him, that our minds may rest easy."},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; The deftarm will never again fall prey to the whispers of the Onemind.

They were not the Onemind I know. The Onemind, you too have seen. They strike with perfect precision. But these ones...they set upon us with a savage and almost uncontrollable rage. Strange, very strange..."},{"name":"DRYDOX","text":"Now that deftarm mentions it, Drydox heard sound before walkybugs attack. It went <span class=\"emphasis\">boom</span>, but it was not the <span class=\"emphasis\">boom</span> of walkybug shootysticks. No, it was much, much scarier. Drydox heard it from the forest as well..."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Did you hear that, Master!? There can be no doubt of it─our quarry is up to something here as well! We must make for the forest! Yes, to Tailfeather!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Worry not. I will tell the Storyteller that we are safe from harm. Please go visit Marcechamp and see if all is well. I will join you with all speed!"},{"name":"DRYDOX","text":"Deftarm looks as happy as Drydox does when she finds a trove of nanka eggs! Drydox is happy for Deftarm, but worries for his safety. Uplander will be careful too, yes?"},{"name":"STORYTELLER","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Relieved I am to hear the deftarm is safe, but it would seem you pursue a far more menacing foe. Still, I trust that he will be safe with a great hunter like you at his side."},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"Oho, look who's back. What brings you to Tailfeather, friend? That Deftarm got you on another wild chocobo chase, I reckon?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; We chase something far more frightful than chocobos, Marcechamp!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"I come on behalf of the moogles of Moghome. I ask you: have you encountered a masked man brandishing a gun in this forest?"},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"'Fraid I have indeed, as much as I'd like to say otherwise. See, the man's been makin' quite a name for himself in these parts─and it ain't a good one. Had the misfortune of runnin' into him myself not hours ago."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"He came here, you say!? Where did he go!? You must tell me, Marcechamp! I must know!"},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"Listen to me, Deftarm, and listen well. If you know what's good for you, you'll walk out of here the way you came, and forget anythin' and everythin' you ever heard or saw about that man."},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"The man you're after is an adventurer, but not one o' the nice ones like your master here. Aye, he's nothin' short o' the most ruthless assassins our realm has ever seen─a cold-blooded killer who's never met a job too dirty or dangerous for his likin'. Nor one he has failed to carry out with lethal perfection."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"An adventurer, you say!? Why, who better to pursue this man than Master and myself! Yes, this is our duty! Our calling!"},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"Did you hear a single bloody word I─!? &lt;sigh&gt; Sometimes I don't even know why I bloody try..."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Worry not, Marcechamp! Your words of warning have not fallen on deaf ears! But I am the deftarm, and I must do what needs be done! Is that not so, Master!?"},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"Heh. If you're itchin' to get your head blown off your shoulders, who am I to stop you? Your man was last seen headin' for the western highlands of Coerthas. Just don't come cryin' to me when the hunter becomes the hunted!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Thank you, friend, and worry not! Between Master and myself, we will be more than a match for this masked menace!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Mind you, Master, I do not wish to rely overmuch on your aid. I accepted this job from the moogles, and I intend to see it done with my own hand. That said, I would ask you to accompany me for...moral support. You understand, yes?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"Excellent! And with that, let us be off to Coerthas! Perhaps our friend Jantellot will have some news for us upon our arrival. Yes, surely he will!"},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"Just between you and me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>... This man's dangerous─no doubtin' that─but so long as you stick by the deftarm's side, I reckon the two o' you will come out of it with no more than a couple o' scratches. Just don't let your guard down, eh?"},{"name":"JANTELLOT","text":"Ah, 'tis you. Forgive me, but a pressing matter requires my undivided attention at the moment. If you need something of me, pray return on the morrow."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Please listen, Jantellot! For a pressing matter requires our attention as well! Yes, very pressing!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"On behalf of the moogles of Moghome, we have come to Coerthas in pursuit of a certain adventurer. He wears a mask on his face and wields a pistol in his hand. Perhaps you have seen such a man?"},{"name":"JANTELLOT","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Seen</span> him, you say!? Aye, I caught a glimpse... I arrived just in time to see him nigh blast the head off one of my loyal men before commandeering our brand-new manacutter and flying off in it to the Fury knows where!"},{"name":"JANTELLOT","text":"You will forgive me if I am somewhat on edge. We scrimped and saved what little coin we could muster, and waited months on end until this vessel was available...only to see it spirited away from us the selfsame day! All while I could do nothing but look on like a helpless half-wit!"},{"name":"JANTELLOT","text":"At least I emerged from the episode unscathed, which is more than I can say for my subordinate. Serves him right, though. Maybe when his wounds heal he'll think twice before picking a fight with a hardened criminal in a caelumtree wine-induced stupor."},{"name":"JANTELLOT","text":"You heard me right─ridiculous mask or no, that man isn't one to be trifled with. I know not how well these moogles are paying you, but I highly doubt that the reward is worth your life."},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; This is not a matter of coin, but one of trust and duty! What is an adventurer worth if his word counts for nothing? Nothing, I say! Yes, the deftarm will see this job done! Now tell me, which way did the masked man go?"},{"name":"JANTELLOT","text":"Bwahaha! You have spirit, I will give you that. Adventuring sounds to be a thankless job, but I wish you the best in it. Your man─and my manacutter─were last sighted heading for the Sea of Clouds. Do try to stay alive, won't you?"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; Thank you, friend, and worry not for me! The deftarm has the courage and conviction of a hundred of your men! We will see this merciless marauder brought to justice!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; You don't suppose this masked man truly is as dangerous as our friends suggest, do you, Master? I cannot help but feel like they are underestimating our abilities.
