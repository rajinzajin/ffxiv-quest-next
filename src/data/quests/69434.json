You cannot be certain because of his helmet, but it may be a twinkle.","The next essential piece of the Rolling Tankard prototype is its cannon, though Ronitt is unsure how best to proceed. He comes to the conclusion that utilizing condensed aether should prove effective in combating sin eaters, although this is a field in which none of the dwarves present have any experience. Regitt recommends seeking the advice of Lorathia, who was once an engineer at the Crystarium.<br><br>â€»Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Ronitt arrives in Clearmelt to ask Lorathia whether she has any knowledge of aether-based weaponry. Fate conspires once again to bless him with outrageous fortune when Lorathia reveals she is in fact the very person who designed the crystal cannons that line the Crystarium. However, rather than go into any further details regarding this, Lorathia instead invites you to a tea party with her two friends, Iriolva and Cobleva. These elderly twins own merchant caravans that deliver goods across Norvrandt, and they are looking for a way to fend off sin eaters. Lorathia points out that this is an opportunity for Ronitt to secure buyers for his tanks, although his lack of social decorum requires that you be on hand to guide him through this informal exchange. ","The tea party ends with both twins expressing a keen interest in Ronitt's creations, although they will need to see the final product in action before they commit to a purchase.","Lorathia gives you a letter of introduction to speak with Rosard in the Crystarium. She is confident he can assist in designing the tank's cannon, though it is still unclear whether you will need to jump through any more proverbial hoops before he agrees to help.","Rosard is eager to support you and Ronitt in your endeavors, and provides you with the blueprints to the Crystarium's crystal cannons. While your dwarven companion is taken aback by the unexpected show of generosity, Rosard explains that he is acting in accordance with Lorathia's wishes, as stated in her letter.","Back at Watts's Anvil, Ronitt asks you to craft some of the cannon's components, as described in the blueprints. As before, his automaton somehow has the exact materials required stored in its metallic belly, though this miraculous ability to produce precisely what is needed at any given moment should come as no surprise by now.","With the necessary materials at your disposal, you are ready to fulfill Ronitt's order. But will your attempt to assist Ronitt end in triumph or bitter failure?","Mastery of your craft has ensured you seized victory rather than bitter defeat. As is customary, Ronitt downplays your achievement, though delight is clear on his face. Or would be, if one could see it. Although the prototype Rolling Tankard is ready for its first test run, Ronitt will still require your aid with other miscellaneous tasks in preparation for the next stage of his master plan: mass production."],"objectives":["Speak with Ronitt.","Speak with Lorathia.","Speak with Lorathia again.","Speak with Rosard in the Crystarium.","Speak with Ronitt at Watts's Anvil.","Obtain materials from the Fetchomatic Mechatoad.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize [Error]</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver [Error] to Ronitt</span></span>."],"dialogue":[{"name":"RONITT","text":"It's time to work on the most interestin' part of the Rollin' Tankard's design: the cannon!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Me and the others have a few things to go over first, so come and join us in the usual place."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"...But those bastard sin eaters won't even get the chance to test our defenses if we blow their heads off first!

Aren't you afraid I'll steal your secrets? And why did you even invite me to this meeting in the first place?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Well, you want me to finish buildin' these tanks, don't you? Our reasons might be different, but we're workin' towards the same goal."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Yeah! Besides, you've already built the brewery, the ethanol mill, and shared a bunch of <span class=\"emphasis\">your</span> secrets with us. You're on board now whether you like it or not!"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"I didn't agree to become one of your lackeys! I come and go as I please!"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"And how do I know all this stuff about sin eaters isn't some elaborate ruse? You could be building these war machines to attack Komra!"},{"name":"KARUTT","text":"Well, we weren't pl-planning to, but now that you mention it..."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Ozogg, that's a load of claptrap and you know it. If we wanted to invade Komra, it be as easy as snatchin' the helmet off a baby, and we wouldn't need no tanks, neither! We just wanna help people, that's all."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Ain't that right!?"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"Hmph! That's all very noble, I'm sure, but I'm only here for one thing: Watts's hammer! If getting my hands on it means I have to help with your idiotic plan, so be it!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Idiotic? That's rich comin' from you! And maybe you should wait till I've finished explainin' about the cannon before you start judgin'!"},{"name":"KARUTT","text":"Y-You mean to say sin eaters won't run away, even if they're injured? Watts's beard... What have we g-gotten ourselves into!?"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"Why injure them when you can kill them outright? They won't be getting up again if you blast them to smithereens.

Got any suggestions?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Bombarding them with magic from a distance usually gets the job done."},{"name":"A1","text":"A beam of pure energy. It'll look pretty, too."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Magic? Dunno about that, mate. I think hiring a qualified mage to go along for the ride might get expensive. But if there was a way to produce a similar effect using machinery, that would be worth explorin'."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"So, we can destroy sin eaters and look good while we do it? Well, it's got my vote!"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"Hmm... The only method I can think of would be to charge a crystal with aether and then release it all in one go. Though I hate to say it, but this is rather outside of my field of expertise."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Why don't you ask that Lorathia lady over at Clearmelt? She used to be an engineer."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"It's worth a try, I guess."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I'd feel a lot better if you came with me, for moral support, like. To tell the truth, I find her a bit intimidatin'... A-Anyway, let's get goin'!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Phew! Thank the gods you're here! I was afraid I'd have to talk to her by myself. Ah well, here goes nothin'..."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Lali-ho, old crone!"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Bloody hells. I see your manners haven't improved since the last time we met. &lt;sigh&gt; Whatever it is you came to say, spit it out. I've got guests arriving soon."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"You want to fit the tanks with aether cannons? So you do have more than sawdust in that head of yours."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Seems like a backhanded compliment to me, but I'll take it all the same! Though I must admit, I'm not used to workin' with aether and whatnot. Don't s'pose you know anythin' about it?"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"As a matter of fact, I'm the one who designed the crystal cannons lining the walls of the Crystarium."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Nah, you're pullin' my leg. I've had a lot of strange coincidences lately, but that's not even remotely feasible. Wait...you're serious, aren't you?"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Of course I am! But if you want me to share my secrets, you'd better make it worth my while!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Ah! I know where this is leadin'! You're gonna send us to the ends of the earth on some godsforsaken errand, just to test our resolve, aren't you?"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"No, you bloody idiot, that's not what I mean at all! Listen, I have some friends coming over for tea and I want the pair of you to join us."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Tea? That's slightly less perilous than I was expectin'. But what does that have to do with anythin'?"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"If you shut your piehole, you might find out! My guests are twin sisters whose supply caravans run the length and breadth of Norvrandt. I reckon they'll have more than a passing interest in buying those tanks of yours."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Buy? You mean to tell me we could make a <span class=\"emphasis\">profit</span> on these tanks? I was plannin' to give 'em away for nothin', but I might as well take the opportunity to line my pockets."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"It's clear your friend's not much of a businessman, so you'd better do the talking."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"I still have some things to prepare before my guests arrive, so give me a few moments, would you?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"All I have to do is shut up and let you handle it. So why am I so nervous!?"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Now that everything's in order, we're ready to begin. Try not to look so tense, dear!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to engage Lorathia's guests in polite conversation and extol the virtues of Ronitt's master plan. Choose the best responses and generate interest in the Rolling Tankard."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This coming together of great mindsâ”€plus Ronittâ”€will take several minutes. You may wish to cancel any pending Duty Finder registrations."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Are your nerves suitably steeled?"},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"What a pleasure it is to make your acquaintance. Lorathia tells us you're in the transportation business, much like Cobleva and I."},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"Yes, we were rather hoping you'd help us with a little problem we've been having of late: hordes of ravenous sin eaters. Terribly irritating, as I'm sure you can imagine."},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"Is it true that you and yours are presently engaged in the construction of some sort of vehicle capable of warding off such assailants?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Ward off? Turn them into mincemeat, more like!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"It transports goods safely while repelling all manner of threats."},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"Oh, I say! That sounds positively ghastly! And I don't think our clients will take too kindly to having their wares covered in bits of mangled sin eater."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Well, ah...the cannons are only to be used in emergencies! It's not like the tanks would be sent out lookin' for trouble or nothin'!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"(Oi, might wanna spare them the grisly details, you know?)"},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"Well, that does sound rather impressive! This could be precisely what we need."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"If any sin eaters dare show up, the Rollin' Tankard can deal with 'em before they get anywhere near."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"(Heh heh, seems like you've got a way with words. Keep this up and they'll be putty in our hands!)"},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"It does occur to me, however, that this all seems awfully complicated. Those used to working with amaro may struggle to operate these vehicles of yours."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The controls are manned by a purpose-built automaton."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"What could possibly go wrong? Just pull the levers and see what happens!"},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"The wonders of modern technology never cease to amaze me. Machines driving machines... Whatever next!"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"That's...a surprisingly good idea."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"If all it takes is giving instructions to the automaton, anyone could do it. Quite an elegant solution, I must say."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"(You just made that up, didn't you? Ah well, we can work all that out later! For now, carry on doin' what you're doin'!)"},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"It strikes me that trial and error is somewhat ill-advised when dealing with heavy weaponry. I'd hate to blow up something I'm not supposed to!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Oh...um... Hahaha! That was just one of <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s little jokes! What <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> really means is that an automaton will take care of everythin'!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"(Bloody hells! Even <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> wouldn't say somethin' that bleedin' stupid!)"},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"While this is all very intriguing, young Ronitt, I would feel much more comfortable doing business with you if I could see your face, that I may better read your intentions. Though I do not doubt your sincerity, consider it a matter of courtesy."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Y-You want me to take off my h-helmet? B-But..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Dwarven law prohibits it."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"And then what!? You want him to dance on the table for you!?"},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"Oh, I beg your pardon! That was incredibly rude of me."},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"We are, much to our embarrassment, unfamiliar with dwarven customs. You were very kind to intervene and prevent any further impertinence on our part."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Thanks, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. If you weren't here, I don't know what I would've done!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"(Bugger my beard! Why'd you have to say that!? Gods, this is awkward...)"},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"Well, I think we've covered most of the pertinent points."},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"There is, however, one last thing we would like to ask before we reach a decision. What do you think we sisters value most in all the world?"},{"name":"IRIOLVACOBLEVA","text":"(-Iriolva and Cobleva-)Your answer, please!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Honesty."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Excitement."},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"Oh dear! That's not quite the answer we were looking for."},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"We would like to think that honesty is the bare minimum we can expect from others, especially those with whom we would do business."},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"Luckily, we have been able to ascertain through the course of this conversation that the two of you possess this in abundance."},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"The perfect answer!"},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"What would life be like without a little excitement? And what could be more exciting than an ambitious new enterprise, such as the one you are proposing!"},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"It seems that with our business acumen and your...tanks, we have a match made in the heavens!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Haha! We did it! And they've really taken a shine to you, it seems."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Iriolva and Cobleva's joyous response bodes well for Ronitt and his Rolling Tankards. You have almost certainly secured buyers for his tanks, provided they reach completion."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Phew! That was a bit of a struggle, but we got there in the end! Nicely done!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Iriolva and Cobleva's warm response bodes well for Ronitt and his Rolling Tankards. It appears that you have secured buyers for his tanks, provided they reach completion."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Ungh... I'm glad that's over. Maybe you ought to let me do the talkin' next time, eh?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Iriolva and Cobleva were clearly unimpressed by your conversation skills, or lack thereof. In spite of your series of blunders, however, hope is not yet lost. There yet remains the possibility they may purchase Ronitt's tanks after all."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Of course, seeing is believing. Once the tanks are finished, you should put on a demonstration. We'd all be interested to see those aetherial cannons in action, but actually getting them up and running will be no easy task, I assure you."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Lucky for you, I know just the man to point you in the right direction. I'll write you a letter of introduction requesting he help you in this little endeavor."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"It's been a while since we met, and I can't for the life of me remember how they take their tea..."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Give this letter to Rosard in Ballistics. He looks a bit imposing, but he's friendly enough."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Then again, if it's <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> doing the asking, I'm sure he'd be more than happy to help."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Hmph! One of these days, the people of Norvrandt'll be climbin' over each other for the chance to do <span class=\"emphasis\">me</span> a favor, just you wait and see!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"But until then, I've got a lot of work ahead of me, so let's get goin'!"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"I've known that Rosard since he was knee-high to a phooka. Wait, do they even have knees?"},{"name":"COBLEVA","text":"Lorathia always serves such wonderful tea, and the scenery here is to die for!"},{"name":"IRIOLVA","text":"Is that the distant rumbling of tanks I hear? Or perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Are we done yet? All this bein' polite's worn me out..."},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"Greetings! What can I do for you this fine <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">evening</span><span class=\"alternative\">morning</span><span class=\"alternative\">day</span></span>?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"...and blow their bloody heads off! That's the plan, anyway."},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"Ho ho! If it's aether-based firepower you're after, I have just the thing. Right behind me, as it happens!"},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"This model was mass-produced and installed along the perimeter of the Crystarium, specifically to deal with sin eater assaults. Those bastards soon give up the ghost after a blast of concentrated aether to the face! Bwahaha!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I like the sound of that!"},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"I can't take the credit for these crystal cannons, though. Lorathia's the one who originally designed them. I suppose you could call her my mentor."},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"If she says I'm to assist you, who am I to refuse? Now, let me see about getting you copies of our cannon blueprints."},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"A pleasant surprise, I take it? Ha, that's the Lorathia I know. Behind that sharp tongue and piercing gaze, she's one of the most caring people you'll ever meet. I expect she appreciates what you're doing, especially considering what happened at Holminster."},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"Not to mention that we in the Crystarium owe much and more to you for restoring the night sky. It's not every day we get the chance to aid the Warrior of Darkness <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">herself</span><span class=\"alternative\">himself</span></span>!"},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"And it goes without saying we here in the Crystarium are extremely grateful for everything you're doing. You're an inspiration to us all!"},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"At any rate, every sin eater your tanks put down is one less for our soldiers to deal with, so sharing the plans for the crystal cannons is the least we can do."},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"In the meantime, I'll look forward to hearing of your success."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"It won't be long before tales of the Rollin' Tankards are on the lips of everyone in Norvrandt. Many thanks, Rosard!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Come on, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. We've got cannons to build! To the Anvil!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Crystal cannon? Check. Big man? Check. This must be the place."},{"name":"ROSARD","text":"When Lorathia was here, she'd spend about half her time working and the other half drinking tea. She still got more done than the rest of us put together, though."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Rosard give you what you need, did he? Better get to work, then!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I swear, everywhere we go, people treat you like you're some sort of hero! I suppose bein' a hero's most trusted friend is the next best thing, so I'll settle for that."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Havin' said that, when it comes to buildin' these tanks, you're still my assistant! Ha! And it just so happens I've got some work for you."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"There's more to these cannons than just crystal, as you can probably guess. In fact, there are so many different parts, it makes my head spin just thinkin' about it!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I reckon there are a few things you can put together for me, though. Shouldn't be too hard for someone as skilled as you."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I reckon there are a few things you can put together for me, though. Shouldn't be too hard for someone as skilled as you."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I reckon there are a few things you can concoct for me, though.

Don't keep me in suspense!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Heh! Looks like all that time spent around a master engineer like me is payin' off."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Once I've built and fine-tuned the cannon, the prototype tank'll be ready!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"After that, it's just a matter of producin' more of the same as quickly and cheaply as possible. Not that I'll be cuttin' any corners, mind!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"With the final piece of the puzzle, the crystal cannon, in place, the Rolling Tankard prototype is all but complete."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"However, this marks only the beginning of Ronitt's plans, as it will take more than a single tank to ensure the safe transportation of goods to and from various locations across Norvrandt."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have achieved <span class=\"highlight\">Respected</span> reputation with Watts's Anvil."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"New dwarf tribal daily quests are now available from Regitt at Watts's Anvil."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Furthermore, you will be able to undertake three additional quests from Regitt as a reputation bonus.
