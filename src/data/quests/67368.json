However, it is not certain whether the moogle is injured or merely taking a nap. Talk to the moogle to find out if he is in a predicament that needs solving, or if he would just like to be left in dreamland.","It seems an encounter with a nearby tree has left the Pomguard moogle dazed, confused, and unable to move. The only thing that may possibly save him is a kupo nut. Though Mogleo is leery of the seriousness of the moogle's condition, he decides to aid him nonetheless. Speak with Mogleo to receive instructions.","Mogleo laments that he cannot solve this problem on his own, and decides that he will stand watch over the Pomguard moogle while you return to Moghome for a kupo nut. Make your way back to the settlement and ask Moggzia if he has any of the precious nuts to spare.","Moggzia seems to have more kupo nuts than he knows what to do with, and readily hands one over to aid a member of the Pomguard. Hurry and give the nut to the ailing moogle before the last of his limited energy leaves his pom.","Upon eating the kupo nut, the Pomguard moogle's disposition changes drastically, and his earlier ailment seems like a distant memory. Before you can even wonder at his remarkable recovery, he bids you and Mogleo join him back at Moghome for a meeting with his commander, Captain Mogloo.","Mogleo hesitantly presents himself before Captain Mogloo of the Pomguard, who scolds him for putting himself in danger by going out into the wilderness alone. To ensure that Mogleo has a proper outlet for his altruistic tendencies, Mogloo names him a new member of the Pomguard. It would seem that moogles from all over the Churning Mists have vouched for Mogleo, the Pomguard member he but recently rescued among them. With his courage and selflessness, Mogleo will make a fine addition to the lauded ranks of the Pomguard."],"objectives":["Speak with the Pomguard moogle.","Speak with Mogleo.","Obtain a kupo nut from Moggzia.","Deliver the kupo nut to the Pomguard moogle.","Speak with Mogloo."],"dialogue":[{"name":"TROUBLEMOG03","text":"It's great to be back in Asah, but I miss my flowers, kupo..."},{"name":"MOGGUARD01","text":"I can't...
