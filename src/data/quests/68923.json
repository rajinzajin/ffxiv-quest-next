My man Roi-Tatch has readied the supplies for delivery to the Imperative, so pray speak with him before you take to the road. Once again, you have my gratitude."},{"name":"MYNES","text":"Decided to sojourn with us a bit longer? I'm sure my men appreciate the company. At any rate, whenever you are ready to return to the Imperative, Roi-Tatch can furnish you with the supplies to be delivered."},{"name":"ROITATCH","text":"Oh, hello there. I take it you're the good-natured dupe─er, the <span class=\"emphasis\">kindly traveler</span> who's agreed to lug this hefty crate of supplies all the way to the bleedin' Ostall Imperative. Well, here are the goods!"},{"name":"ROITATCH","text":"Jests aside, you do us a great service. We were fortunate when a merchant caravan en route to Amh Araeng decided to sojourn here at the Round for a spell. We were able to restock all manner of supplies that we'd been short on for months."},{"name":"ROITATCH","text":"That's how the supply chain works in these parts: caravans pass through bound for far-flung locales, we restock supplies as best we can, and then we ship them out to outposts across Lakeland."},{"name":"ROITATCH","text":"'Course, we don't always have enough free hands to make the deliveries. That's why we're most obliged to the kindness of strangers like yourself. Anyhow, I won't keep you any longer. Be safe on the road, friend."},{"name":"ROITATCH","text":"Decided to stay with us a while longer? If you like this dreary place so much, perhaps you'd be interested in trading places? Ahaha, but I jest─once again, much obliged for your help with the delivery, friend."},{"name":"TEANNA","text":"Ah, you're back, greenhorn. Hm? What's that you have with you?"},{"name":"TEANNA","text":"A fresh crate of supplies! Perhaps you're not so useless after all! ...Actually, I have an apology to make. While you were away, my commanding officer informed me that not only are you not a greenhorn, you're not even a member of the guard."},{"name":"TEANNA","text":"I suppose I should have been able to tell by your...unconventional garb. Anyhow, rest assured that I got a good tongue-lashing for my presumptuousness. I won't let it happen again."},{"name":"TEANNA","text":"That said, I <span class=\"emphasis\">am</span> most grateful for your service─you're a damn sight more useful than half of the men here. Perhaps you'd consider joining us someday? In the meantime, I've been instructed to pass along your reward. Don't be a stranger, now!"}],"reward":{"gil":810,"items":[{"id":26845}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}],"quests":[68922]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1027353","obj":{"i":1027353,"n":"Mynes","l":2953,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1027419","obj":{"i":1027419,"n":"Teanna","l":2953,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"26845","obj":{"i":26845,"n":"Deepgold Ring Coffer (IL 395)","l":1,"c":26567,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"68922","obj":{"i":68922,"n":"An Unreasonable Request","g":113,"l":"Lakeland","s":2070,"f":1}}]}
