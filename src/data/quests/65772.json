I realize we've only just met, but I am in dire need of help.

Its members have come to the three city–states to help the people celebrate All Saints' Wake...or so they claim."},{"name":"GODRIQUELAIN","text":"Lest we spread undue panic, what I am about to tell you, I ask that you keep in the strictest confidence: the members of this troupe are not people, but fiends who possess the ability to alter their form at will."},{"name":"GODRIQUELAIN","text":"Since setting up for the festivities, they have yet to do any harm, but there is no guarantee that that will remain the case. The safety of the citizens being paramount, the Adventurers' Guild has tasked me with keeping watch for suspicious activity."},{"name":"GODRIQUELAIN","text":"Upon learning that the circus is recruiting helpers, I thought to volunteer myself that I might get close to its members and determine if they pose a threat. Alas, at some point, they became aware of my intent, and I can no longer proceed as planned.

While the saints feasted in the heavens, the fiends wreaked havoc on the realm below."},{"name":"CONJURER65772","text":"But these days, the Wake is all about having fun, and we of the Continental Circus have made it our mission to see that everyone has a frighteningly good time!"},{"name":"CONJURER65772","text":"How do we mean to achieve this, you ask? Through the art of illusion, that's how! I shall cast a spell that will lend you a most frightening guise. While in that guise, I would have you terrorize the citizens."},{"name":"CONJURER65772","text":"The people you see in Old Gridania should make suitable victims.

A fiendishly convincing one, to be sure, but an illusion nonetheless."},{"name":"PARSEMONTRET","text":"My lady! T-To what do I owe the pleasure of your presence?<br>...No, wait. This is highly unlikely. It must be some kind of illusion. A fiendishly convincing one, to be sure, but an illusion nonetheless."},{"name":"PARSEMONTRET","text":"Ah, so I was right! This calls to mind the time I first witnessed sylphic glamours. I was but a child, and was rather awed by it all."},{"name":"PARSEMONTRET","text":"Since then I've had something of an interest in illusions, and yours, my friend, is most impressive. My day was anything but eventful until you came along, and I thank you for the diversion."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Parsemontret seems to be delighted rather than affrighted by your antics..."},{"name":"PARSEMONTRET","text":"The Wood Wailers are up in arms.
