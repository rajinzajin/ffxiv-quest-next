He, however, lacks mammoth meat─the Budugan's favored meat. Due to his standing within his tribe he is unable to ask the warriors to procure some for him, thus he turns to you with pleading eyes and requests that you bring back two mammoth carcasses. Once you are done slaying the beasts, he would like for you to come find him at the Bridge of the High Rule Warriors, where he will be training.","You travel to the northeast and make quick work of two mammoths. This should more than suffice for the banquet. Take their carcasses to Esugen, who awaits your arrival at the Bridge of the High Rule Warriors.","You come upon Esugen, who is trying in vain to defend himself against a swarm of angry vilekin. Stepping in, you quickly dispatch of them. Despite the fact that the threat is now gone, Esugen is still trembling. Lend him a steadying hand.","You aid Esugen, who thanks you for your help. He then reveals to you that he is of delicate constitution and even performing what seem like mundane tasks often leaves him short of breath. While disappointed in the results of today, he is not yet ready to give up. He then bids you to meet him at the Dawn Throne and bring the two mammoth carcasses with you.","You deliver the carcasses to Esugen and, in doing so, have saved the banquet being held in honor of the Buduga. While he is disappointed by his own inability to conquer the swarm of vilekin that attacked him earlier, he intends to drown out his sorrows through cooking. He seems to have also come to the conclusion that instead of pursuing becoming strong it would be to the benefit of everyone for him to continue doing what he does best─providing good food."],"objectives":["Slay two mammoths to obtain their carcasses.","Report to Esugen.","Aid Esugen.","Deliver the mammoth carcasses to Esugen."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ESUGEN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I am glad you are here!
