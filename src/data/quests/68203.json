Only, I have just discovered the price I was charged and paid to be well above market value. I returned to demand a refund of the difference, but the shopkeeper would not so much as speak to me."},{"name":"TIMIDWOMAN02667","text":"My master is a strict man, and I fear he will take the amount I have cost him out of my pay.
