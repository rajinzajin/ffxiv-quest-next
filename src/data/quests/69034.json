There's coin in it for you."},{"name":"MINEBERN","text":"It shouldn't be too hard to find thistle moles around here. Give them a few licks and they'll keel right over.

I'm not sure if the creaking had any negative effect on the mill itself, but it was bloody annoying!"},{"name":"MINEBERN","text":"I suppose you're wondering what we'd need a windmill for in the first place, seeing as we've no crops to mill into flour. It's actually used for drawing up water from deep underground."},{"name":"MINEBERN","text":"Of course, if anything were to go wrong, we'd have a serious problem on our hands, and it's my job to make sure that doesn't happen.
