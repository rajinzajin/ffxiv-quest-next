I can do naught to aid you. I say to you again, leave this place and never return."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...At the very least, <span class=\"emphasis\">sir</span>, you might condescend to tell us of your village, and of why you are so loath to show us even the most <span class=\"emphasis\">basic</span> courtesy."},{"name":"SHIOSAI","text":"...Sui–no–Sato is our sanctuary. Under the benevolent leadership of the Ruby Princess, sovereign of Shisui, we Raen enjoy humble yet fulfilling lives. But it was not always so."},{"name":"SHIOSAI","text":"Long ago, our forebears were driven from their ancestral lands. Beneath the waters, they sought refuge from the ravages of war, and here they flourished. All that we are─our culture, our traditions─was born of the sea. As was I."},{"name":"SHIOSAI","text":"Though we have engaged others in diplomacy, it has ever been with the utmost caution. Isolation and independence are essential to preserving our way of life."},{"name":"SHIOSAI","text":"So it was when Doma fell twenty-five years past. The Ruby Princess, in her wisdom, decreed that we would take no part. As it was, so ever shall it be."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Forever and ever apart...<br>Forgive me.

But this changes nothing."},{"name":"SHIOSAI","text":"Regardless of your intentions, it is not my place to break with tradition."},{"name":"SHIOSAI","text":"I must consider the wishes of all who call Sui–no–Sato home. For me to defy their will and permit outsiders to remain would be a gross betrayal of my responsibilities. Please do not ask this of me."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...Thank you for your time, sir."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Everywhere we go it's the same. “Go away, we don't want any.” You'd think I'd be used to it by now, but some stupid part of me just can't help hoping for the best."},{"name":"SHIOSAI","text":"It is not for me to make exceptions. I am bound by our rules, as are you. Please, leave us be."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And so it continues. Another village, another deaf ear."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Clearly, Gyr Abania is not the only place with walls."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I'm starting to wonder if this was all a huge mistake.
