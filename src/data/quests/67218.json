Speak with him at the Quicksand for further details.","The Conjurers' Guild had contacted the many cities of Eorzea, requesting any information that might lead to the apprehension of Waldeve and his dangerous cult. A response has finally come from the Temple Knights of Ishgard. The Defiant have been witnessed at the Holy See. Zhai'a Nelhah knows nothing of this nation and requests your assistance in following up on this sighting. Travel to the Arc of the Worthy in Ishgard and speak with the Temple Knights for more details concerning Waldeve's whereabouts.","You soon find a Temple Knight, who explains that the Defiant were recently proselytizing in the Holy See. When the Temple Knights moved to stop them, the cultists fled the city. However, the trail has not been lost. Reports now reach the capital that the Defiant have been seen at the Convictory, in the Coerthas western highlands. However, the Convictors do not share the Temple Knights' resolute steadfastness. Travel to the Convictory and stop the Defiant before they can rally these impressionable young soldiers to their cause.","There is no sign of the Defiant at the Convictory. Try asking some of the troops if they have seen any suspicious mages recently.","You question the Convictors and learn that, as best you can tell, none of them were fooled by the Defiant's promises of easy power. You also hear that the cultists have set up camp near the Swiftrun River, southeast of the Convictory. Unfortunately, it seems that Zhai'a Nelhah has heard this, too, and has headed off to confront them without you. Find him before he gets himself killed.","You find Zhai'a Nelhah in time to assist him in fending off an attack by the Defiant. He apologizes for his hypocrisy in attempting to engage the cultists alone. However, he goes on to explain that he feared the Defiant mages would lose control of their powers if forced to defend themselves against a black mage of your skill. With, once again, no Defiant survivors to question, you are left with no leads. Return to Lalai and pass on Zhai'a Nelhah's apologies.","Though you were unable to apprehend Waldeve, Lalai sees this latest development as encouraging. The fact that the Defiant were forced to travel all the way to the frozen wastelands of western Coerthas would seem to confirm that they are growing increasingly desperate. If things continue in this vein, it will not be much longer before these renegade black mages are brought to justice. And when they are, the dangerous tome of dark magicks they have stolen─the Book of Thal─can be safely secured.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 60."],"objectives":["Speak with Zhai'a Nelhah at the Quicksand.","Speak with the Temple Knight near the Arc of the Worthy.","Speak with Zhai'a Nelhah at the Convictory.","Gather information about the Defiant.","Search for Zhai'a Nelhah southeast of the Convictory.","Report to Lalai.","Defeat the Defiant!"],"dialogue":[{"name":"LALAI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I just received word from Zhai'a Nelhah─he wants to speak with us!"},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Apparently, he has secured lodging at the Hourglass, and is awaiting us at the Quicksand. We should head there now. I wonder what he could want...?"},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Zhai'a Nelhah is waiting for us at the Quicksand. I suppose we shouldn't keep him.<br>...At least, not <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> long..."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Thank you for coming so quickly. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I have something to ask of you."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Some time ago, the Conjurers' Guild contacted the various cities of the realm, entreating assistance in the search for─and capture of─Waldeve. It seems that this finally paid off. They just received a missive from the Temple Knights of Ishgard. The Defiant have been sighted at the Holy See!"},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"The cult has been trying to garner popular support there. They've been offering what they claim is “the power to defeat the Dravanians” to anyone who will listen."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"I hear that you have made something of a name for yourself among the High Houses of Ishgard. I, however, know next to nothing about their lands."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Now that Ishgard has opened its borders, it is no longer difficult to travel to the Holy See. However, I still know next to nothing about their lands."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Please, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, would you lend me your assistance in tracking down this evil cult and bringing them to justice?"},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Zhai'a, you have made no effort to conceal your disapproval of we black mages and our ways. Are we to understand that you have now come to accept us?"},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"...That I have.<br>The Temple Knights who provided us with this intelligence are stationed at the Arc of the Worthy, within the city of Ishgard. They will be waiting for us there."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Much though I would like to believe that he has had a change of heart, men are not wont to change so simply. One does not live one's whole life hating black magic, only to change one's mind over the exoneration of a single mage."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"I know not what this man is plotting, but I suggest you keep a close eye on him."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"You won't get away this time, Waldeve!"},{"name":"TEMPLEKNIGHT01682","text":"You must be the investigators from Gridania. It's about time! Someone needs to do something about that blasphemous cult."},{"name":"TEMPLEKNIGHT01682","text":"They were ranting on and on to anyone who would listen, offering the power to defeat the Dravanians. We Ishgardians have our own way of fighting─we told them as much quite plainly. But it made no difference; they continued their proselytizing."},{"name":"TEMPLEKNIGHT01682","text":"Obviously such blasphemy could not be allowed to stand. We Temple Knights made our move, but they managed to get away. It hardly mattered to us at the time─they were no longer spreading their lies here─but they recently reappeared, this time at the Convictory in the western highlands."},{"name":"TEMPLEKNIGHT01682","text":"Most Convictors would do anything to earn honor and glory through the slaying of a powerful dragon. They are young and full of spirit...and naive. I fear that some among them may be deceived, seduced by promises of easy power."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Hmph. Gullible fools... Well, our destination is clear. To the Convictory!"},{"name":"TEMPLEKNIGHT01682","text":"The cultists you seek have been sighted at the Convictory, in the Coerthas western highlands."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Hmmm. There is no obvious sign of the Defiant here... We should split up and question the soldiers."},{"name":"DRGONHUNTERA01682","text":"Those crazy mages? I've spent years studying the art of dragonslaying─I don't need some magical help from weird outsiders. I made sure to tell them as much."},{"name":"DRGONHUNTERB01682","text":"I think I know who you're talking about. I told them I wasn't interested. Ancient spells are no match for a good spear at your side!"},{"name":"DRGONHUNTERC01682","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">You're</span> goin' on about the Defiant, too? Well, they spent a while shoutin' about how they'd share ultimate power with any who'd join 'em... Then they left."},{"name":"DRGONHUNTERC01682","text":"Apparently, they've set up camp o'er near the Swiftrun River. What's the story with that lot anyway? Some Miqo'te chap was askin' the same thing a few minutes ago. I told him what I told you an' he ran off in a right hurry!"},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Ungh... I know what you must be thinking... I entreated your help only to run off on my own."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"But you know what happens when you get involved. You saw it happen just now. They've no choice but to fight back with all their strength. And when they do so, they lose control of their power, and they...they burn."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Nobody deserves to die like that. So I went to confront them alone."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"I am a fool! My healing magic is no match for the destructive power they wield."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"We can work together."},{"name":"A1","text":"It was foolish to go alone."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"You're right. What did I expect to achieve, challenging them without any help at all?"},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Had we fought together, things would have turned out differently. You, taking down the mages in a flash of black magic; me, nullifying their every attack with my healing spells..."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"I truly was a fool to assume all black magic was evil. I should have seen that such power can be harnessed safely─just as it is by you."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"I apologize. We have lost our only lead, and this time it is clearly my fault."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Please pass on my apologies to Lalai. My actions were unbefitting of a representative of the Seedseer Council. I shall take my leave. I need to reflect on my actions."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Ah! You're back from Ishgard already! But where is Zhai'a Nelhah?"},{"name":"LALAI","text":"I see. If nothing else, you have stopped more poor souls from joining that accursed cult. I can only hope that Zhai'a Nelhah can see it that way."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"The fact that the Defiant would travel so far as Ishgard in an attempt to recruit new members speaks volumes to how desperate they grow..."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Ah! <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I almost forgot. I was able to decipher the final remaining spell from the Book of Nald. Though you might not welcome an ice magick after the frigid wind of Coerthas, I'm certain you'll find this a frighteningly powerful addition to your repertoire."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"I doubt the Defiant can hold out much longer. They will be forced to use everything they have in the next fight─they cannot risk being drawn into a protracted war of attrition. Should we defeat them, we can finally recover the Book of Thal─and uncover the magicks within!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 60."},{"name":"QIB","text":"We can't let them get away! <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, stop them!"},{"name":"QIB","text":"Watch out! There's more of them!"},{"name":"QIB","text":"They're attempting to summon something! Seal the planar fissures!"},{"name":"QIB","text":"There's yet more of them!
