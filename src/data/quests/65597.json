Search Old Gridania for the poor fellow and obtain more information about his request.","It would seem Camillain, the client, purchased an Angrbotha-brand toadskin jacket to commemorate his son's acceptance into the Wood Wailers─only to discover that the garment was far from functional. In desperation, the hapless fellow turned to the Leatherworkers' Guild and begged them to complete his commission before his son's enlistment ceremony. Sadly, however, he found the guildmaster less than eager to listen to his tale. Speak with Geva and see what she has to say.","Moved by Camillain's story─and not at all by guilt─Geva bids you to create a high-quality toadskin jacket for the devoted father. Craft the item to the best of your ability and present it to Geva for inspection.","Geva judges your toadskin jacket a fitting gift for the young Wailer-to-be. Deliver the jacket to Camillain.","Camillain is overwhelmed by your gesture, praising your craftsmanship and declaring it the finest toadskin jacket he has ever seen. Return to Geva and inform her that the client is satisfied.","While pleased with your success, Geva is frustrated to hear that Angrbotha is continuing to prey upon customers' ignorance. She confides that she hopes the allure of greater notoriety will encourage them to participate in the forthcoming Gridanian exhibition, where they may be exposed and shamed as frauds.<br><br>※The next leatherworker quest will be available from Geva upon reaching level 35."],"objectives":["Speak with Camillain.","Speak with Geva.","Present a toadskin jacket <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Geva.","Deliver the toadskin jacket <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Camillain.","Report to Geva."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GEVA","text":"There you are, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Just the leatherworker I was looking for!"},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Well, one of several I would consider asking─but that's beside the point."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Anyway, I have a task for you."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Mere moments ago, we received an older gentleman who demanded that we give his commission priority. Needless to say, I refused him without hesitation and had him thrown out. In retrospect, however, I believe his forwardness may have owed more to desperation than mere impatience..."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Could you, perhaps, speak with this client on my behalf? I am told he was last seen heading east, in the direction of the market stalls. Of course, he may have gone further than that, but being an energetic adventurer, I'm sure you'll find him eventually."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"You...you are a leatherworker? Thank you for coming to see me... I know that my behavior at the guild was inexcusable."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"Permit me to start from the beginning. I heard tell of a new brand of leather goods that was cheaper than Fen–Yll but just as well made. Not being a wealthy man, I saw no reason to spend the extra gil, and purchased some of this Angrbotha-branded leather armor for my boy...only to be disappointed."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"To an untrained eye it may seem fit for purpose, but I served as a Wood Wailer for many years and could tell at a glance that it was no match for Ixali weapons."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"Aye, they made it fast and cheap as advertised, but had I known the quality would be so bloody awful, I would have found the extra gil and gone to Fen–Yll Fineries in the first place."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"I know what I ask is unreasonable, but my boy is about to enlist in the Wailers, and I wanted to give him something that would last a lifetime─something that his son could wear when the time came. I swear, that Angrbotha stuff wouldn't keep him alive long enough to even <span class=\"emphasis\">have</span> a son."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"Please, would you make me a toadskin jacket?"},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"I want my boy to remember the moment he becomes a Wailer for the rest of his life. Gods, if only I had gone to Fen–Yll Fineries first..."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"...I see."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"A gift from father to son, to be passed down through the ages. Only a well-crafted item could be expected to carry generations of memories and tradition."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"...A toadskin jacket, was it? Well, after hearing such a tale, who could possibly refuse? ...Why are you looking at me like that? It was a <span class=\"emphasis\">rhetorical question</span>, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I'm not a monster!"},{"name":"GEVA","text":"You heard his words, so you know what's at stake better than anyone. I bid you make a toadskin jacket of the highest possible quality and present it to me for inspection."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Remember what's at stake, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. We need a quality toadskin jacket that can withstand generations of wear and tear."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Hmmm... I daresay this is your best work yet. "},{"name":"GEVA","text":"The spaulders and breast are made from the finest toadskin, and the goatskin backing alone would provide solid protection."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"It strikes the perfect balance between mobility and protection, and I can find no fault with it."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Aye, it's a fitting gift for a young Wailer-to-be."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"I expect that Camillain will agree. Take it to him, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"Why oh why did I have to think about the gil...? Everyone knows Fen–Yll goods are the best, and the best is no less than my son deserves. To think of him clad in that Angrbotha <span class=\"emphasis\">crap</span> when he becomes a Wailer... &lt;sigh&gt;"},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"Praise the Matron, a toadskin jacket! I could not have hoped for such kindness!"},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"And this craftsmanship is beyond compare..."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"Not to be, this tag."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"Not to be, this tag."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"In fact, I do not believe I have ever seen finer leather equipment in all my years. My son will be thrilled to receive it!"},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"A craftsman that had never known battle could not possibly have made a jacket like this. Tell me, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, are you...?"},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"But of course. Even Geva has seen fit to welcome capable adventurers like yourself into her guild."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"I hope you will continue to share your gift with the people of Gridania, and give others the opportunity to savor your work."},{"name":"CAMILLAIN","text":"I have truly never seen such a fine toadskin jacket. I know my son will be thrilled to receive it. Thank you, adventurer."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"I take it from your grin that Camillain was satisfied? Glad to hear it."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Gods, I'm getting fed up with this Angrbotha nonsense. First that Ul'dahn merchant, and now this."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Honestly, I don't know what idiotic plan they have in mind, but it's only a matter of time before word spreads. Quickly, cheaply produced goods may entice customers, but quality goods keep them."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"I wonder if they'll even consider participating in the exhibition... On the one hand, there is no better way to publicize your brand, while on the other, they must surely know that they're in no position to compete with real leatherworkers."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"...But I do hope they try, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I would love nothing more than to see those Angrbotha frauds get their comeuppance─to look on as artisans and merchants from every corner of Eorzea cast judgment on their works and proclaim them a disgrace!"}],"reward":{"gil":639,"items":[{"id":2422},{"id":2750,"one":1},{"id":3104,"one":1},{"id":3583,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":5825,"one":1}],"xp":81510},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":30,"id":13}],"quests":[65587]},"next":[65599]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000691","obj":{"i":1000691,"n":"Geva","l":53,"q":20,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000170","obj":{"i":1000170,"n":"Camillain","l":53,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"2422","obj":{"i":2422,"n":"Iron Head Knife","l":28,"c":35406,"t":20,"p":2388}},{"type":"item","id":"2750","obj":{"i":2750,"n":"Velveteen Beret","l":29,"c":41032,"t":34}},{"type":"item","id":"3104","obj":{"i":3104,"n":"Velveteen Gown","l":30,"c":42071,"t":35,"p":2499}},{"type":"item","id":"3583","obj":{"i":3583,"n":"Velveteen Shortgloves","l":28,"c":44081,"t":37,"p":1453}},{"type":"item","id":"5825","obj":{"i":5825,"n":"Allagan Silver Piece","l":25,"c":26001,"t":61}},{"type":"item","id":"3100","obj":{"i":3100,"n":"Toadskin Jacket","l":30,"c":43085,"t":35,"p":3123}},{"type":"quest","id":"65587","obj":{"i":65587,"n":"Skin in the Game","g":140,"l":"Gridania","s":250,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"65599","obj":{"i":65599,"n":"Lead by Example","g":140,"l":"Gridania","s":350,"f":1}}]}
