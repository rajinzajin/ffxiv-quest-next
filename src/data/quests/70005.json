You, Rudy, and Rissai make your way to the Shroud to seek out Baenfaeld, the celebrant in charge of the task.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","Upon seeing the sheer number of gift boxes entrusted to your care, Rissai suggests splitting the task, that you might more swiftly place presents into the young ones' hands. You resolve to follow the ever-eager Rudy and keep watch over him as he passes out his handmade snowball treats.","Rudy gives a gift box to every child he meets. While some are skeptical at first, their faces light up when they see, smell, and taste the delightful and delicious seasonal treats. The children's joy is reflected in Rudy's elated expression at seeing his confections bring so much happiness to those around him. His job done, it appears the little yeti has something to say to you.","Rudy appears to be expressing his satisfaction at being able to serve as one of the saint's little helpers this Starlight. With all the presents safely in the hands of the children, you set out to return to Baenfaeld, who will surely be happy to hear how well this year's gifts were received.","You and Rudy reunite with Rissai and Baenfaeld, but there is unfortunately little time to celebrate your success, as Rudy's brothers─a monstrous pair of yetis─burst into Bentbranch Meadows, intent on taking him back home. Rudy, however, has a thing or two to say to them. With your encouragement─and a confidence altogether new to him─he proudly tells them of how he created the greatest snowball cakes of his life, and helped spread joy to the children this Starlight. One taste of the treats in question is all it takes for his brothers to see how far Rudy has come, and they apologize for treating him so poorly all these years. Finally accepted by his family for who he is, it appears Rudy is ready to return to the mountains.","Rudy is beside himself with gratitude for the role you played in making his first Starlight experience such a memorable one. Much to his delight, the Saint of Nymeia has also left him a letter praising him as the finest little helper of the season. Moved by how far your little friend has come in such a short time─if sad that you must say goodbye─you and Rissai wish Rudy well as he follows his brothers back to their home in the mountains. With nothing left to do here, it is time to report back to Amh Garanjy so that she, too, can take pleasure in your exploits.","Amh Garanjy gives her sincerest thanks for everything you did for Rudy. Moved by his hard work and determination to spread joy to everyone around him, she feels the joyous spirit of the Starlight Celebration burn with a renewed vigor within her. His job here done, Rissai, ever the wanderer, bids you farewell and sets off in search of exotic lands and delightful desserts. For you, however, the festivities are still in full swing, as Amh Garanjy informs you that none other than the Saint of Nymeia himself would have a word with you in person."],"objectives":["Speak with Baenfaeld at Bentbranch Meadows.","Speak with Rudy.","Speak with Rudy again.","Speak with Baenfaeld.","Speak with Rudy.","Speak with Amh Garanjy at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."],"dialogue":[{"name":"RISSAI","text":"As one of the saint's little helpers, it's Rudy's job to bring presents to the children and put smiles on their faces.

Er, even if they do look like they're about to pummel ye..."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"I cannot deny that they are somewhat...disgruntled.

Our little friend Rudy corrected them in scathing terms."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"He told them of the delicious snowball treats we made together, and how the children's faces lit up when we gave them their presents.

Grooowr!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Well, isn't that nice of them? Rudy's brothers just apologized for how they've treated Rudy all this time.

Take care o' yerself out there."},{"name":"BAENFAELD","text":"Aye, it'll be lonely here without the little guy..."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Worry not, my friends. Your paths may very well cross again someday. After all, we never know what fate has in store for us."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"And with that, we had best return and report to Amh Garanjy. I suspect she'll be thrilled, if sad to hear that Rudy has gone away home..."},{"name":"BAENFAELD","text":"Amh'll be overjoyed to hear of yer success. I'd go with ye, but as ye can see, I've got me hands full with gifts still..."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Go on, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Tell her everything that happened with Rudy."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"All done handing out presents, are you? Thank you very much! And good work, Ru─ Wait...where's Rudy gone off to?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Home with his brothers? But I didn't get a chance to say goodbye! Oh, to ruffle his fluffy fur one last time..."},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"You were quite fond of the little fellow, weren't you?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Of course! Who wouldn't get attached to that adorably pouty little face?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"...But if he's happy now, that's all that matters. Allow me to thank you both once more."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Not just for your help with the festivities, but for everything you did for Rudy as well. You helped him find the confidence he needed to make his siblings accept him."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Why, if Rudy's exploits don't fill you with the spirit of Starlight, I daresay nothing willーas a matter of fact, I myself am feeling more enthusiastic about the Celebration than ever!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"And as head celebrant, I will do all in my power to spread smiles and joy with as much passion as Rudy did!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"I, too, very much enjoyed the time we spent together. Truly, it was full of new experiences to look back upon fondly. Isn't that so, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"Yet I fear the time has come for us to part ways. After all, I've lands to traverse, people to meet, and sweets to eat!"},{"name":"RISSAI","text":"I very much hope to see you again someday. And who is to say? Should you ever find yourself in a pinch with a beast again, I may very well appear to lend an ear. Farewell!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Thank you, truly. I know it isn't much, but please take this as a humble token of my appreciation."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"And believe it or not, the saint himself has expressed an interest in meeting you.
