Far by Tomran standards, that is.","Regitt has made the arduous─but not especially long─journey to Wright in search of Ronitt, the young engineering prodigy whom you once taught to lali-ho. It seems that he has set his sights on the Crystarium, where he hopes to track you down, for reasons that are as yet unclear. You kindly agree to accompany Regitt and unravel the mysteries surrounding Ronitt's sudden departure.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","You and Regitt eventually come across a Crystarium guard who claims to have seen a dwarf not too long ago, over at the Crystalline Mean. Wasting no time, you decide to pursue your one and only lead as to Ronitt's whereabouts.","Ronitt is, as Regitt had predicted, cowering in a corner, seemingly overwhelmed by the presence of so many “big folk” in one place. Before long, Katliss of the Mean comes to make the acquaintance of the two dwarves, which in turn prompts Ronitt to reveal why he has journeyed to the Crystarium. Until recently, he was under the impression that you were little more than a passing traveler. Having been informed of your heroic achievements, however, he is now determined to perform great deeds of his own, so as not to be outdone by you, his dear friend. As he cannot hope to compete with you in terms of martial prowess, he instead hopes to improve the lives of the various peoples of the realm through his skills as an engineer. Much to his surprise─and no small amount of chagrin─you reveal that you too have an affinity for crafting, to which Ronitt responds by suggesting that the two of you cooperate in helping the Crystalline Mean. Katliss explains that roving sin eaters have taken to attacking merchant caravans of late, and she is looking for a means of transporting their goods across Lakeland without placing the traders at risk. Ronitt toys with the idea of using his existing line of automata as a possible solution, but comes to the conclusion that major improvements must be carried out, necessitating the need for a large and fully furnished workshop. Katliss then offers the use of an area in Lakeland once designated to the Mean, though you will first need to gain the permission of Lorathia, the land owner, who is known to frequent the baths at Clearmelt.","Ronitt and Regitt get off to a bumpy start with Lorathia, who is not one to tolerate any of their endearing dwarven impertinence. Upon hearing of the plan to upgrade Ronitt's automata, she immediately dismisses the idea, as the current design lacks both the storage capacity for transporting cargo and the weaponry needed to fend off sin eaters. It then dawns on Ronitt that he has been carrying the solution about his person the entire time, and produces from his pocket a blueprint for a tanklike vehicle originally designed by his ancestor and famed engineer, Watts, which he aptly dubbed the “Rolling Tankard.” With room inside for large quantities of goods and a cannon capable of dealing with threats from a distance, all that remains is to actually build one. A task easier said than done, it would seem, as the designs do not show any of its inner workings. Not one to be discouraged, Ronitt claims he will be able to employ modern techniques to finish what would have been impossible in Watts's day. Lorathia eventually caves in and allows the use of her land, mainly out of curiosity, as she too was once an engineer. Ronitt goes ahead to survey the site of the new workshop, with automaton in tow, while Regitt heads back to Tomra to recruit volunteers to assist in building the tanks.","The plot of land on which you and Ronitt will build the workshop has promise, but there is much to be done before tank production can begin. There are a number of basic supplies that must be procured, though thankfully, Ronitt has already had his automaton gather some raw materials. Eager to see your artisanal skills in practice, he tasks you with putting together the first essential pieces of what will eventually become the workshop.","With the workshop─now known as Watts's Anvil─complete and Regitt returned from Tomra with a host of dwarven assistants, the complicated task of designing and constructing a prototype tank can begin. Your role will initially be to lend Regitt a hand in crafting various parts and materials, while Ronitt channels his engineering prowess into his next masterpiece."],"objectives":["Speak with Regitt in the Crystarium.","Speak with Regitt.","Speak with Ronitt at Clearmelt.","Speak with Ronitt.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize a [Error]</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver [Error] to Ronitt</span></span>."],"dialogue":[{"name":"REGITT","text":"Bugger my beard!

But I'm not goin' back to Tomra until I find a way to prove myself your equal!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"And while I'm not much of a fighter, there are other ways I can help those in need. Because unlike the rest of my village, who can't think beyond their next pint of ale, I've got big dreams! Ambitions!"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Now, now. There's nothing wrong with a well-earned drink or ten after a hard day's work, but that's besides the point. How can you hope to compete with someone like <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"You might be known as the greatest warrior the world's ever seen..."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"But there's one thing I can do better than you: craftin'!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Ha!

I suppose there's no need to make it into a competition, though. Why don't we, uh...what's the word...cooperate? There might be someone around here who needs our help."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"How about you, miss? Got anythin' that needs mendin'? Or maybe one of my patented automata can carry out a few menial tasks?"},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"Hmm... Where to begin?"},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"We did receive a report a few days ago of a caravan of merchants being attacked by roving sin eaters, not far from Sullen."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"While they were able to escape without any casualties, they had no choice but to abandon almost all of the produce they were transporting. I fear it's only a matter of time until it happens again. Is there anything you can do?"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Sin eaters? Bugger that."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"This Fetchomatic Mechatoad might come in handy. A few extra spiky bits should do the trick. Hmm... On second thought, it might take more than that. I'll need somewhere to use as a workshop to carry out some modifications..."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"You mean to say you build these yourselves? It certainly is...imposing. In a way only a three-wheeled mechanical frog can be."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Now there's a fine compliment if ever I heard one! I think... This example of dwarven engineering was lovingly crafted by young Ronitt, here. He's a descendant of the great blacksmith Watts, and well on his way to becoming the pride of Tomra in his own right!"},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"Yes, judging by the quality of his work, I can see why."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"In fact, I have a proposal. If you're willing to lend us your expertise, we can arrange space for you to use as a workshop."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Really?"},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"When I say “space,” that's essentially all there is. We'd planned to build a storehouse near the Ostall Imperative, but we had to divert our resources elsewhere, and it was never completed. It seems to me you'd put it to good use."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"After all, a friend of <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s is a friend of ours."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"That's very generous of you, miss! I'll turn that place into a first-class workshop in two shakes of a newborn's beard!"},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"Excellent. I'll inform those at the Imperative, so they aren't too surprised when automata start appearing out of the blue. I suggest you make yourselves known to Lorathia, who owns the land. She's a regular at the Clearmelt springs, so try there first."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Sounds like some meetin' and greetin' is in order. I reckon it'll go a lot smoother if you're there to cover for me in the likely event I put my foot in it somehow. I also have no bloody idea how to get there. So, lead the way!"},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"Please give Lorathia my regards, and do try not to be discouraged if she seems a little...irascible at first."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"So, this is Clearmelt, eh? Funny name for a bunch of rocks and a couple of ponds, if you ask me. More importantly, where's that Lorathia person?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"You there! Old crone! I'm lookin' for Lorathia. You know where she is?"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)Call me an old crone again and I'll rip that silly beard off and shove it down your throat, you mouthy little gobshite."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)But if it's Lorathia you're after, you're looking at her. What do you want?"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)Katliss sent you, did she? Hmm... If she thinks you're all right, that's good enough for me."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)So, tell me, what are you planning to make in this workshop of yours? And don't go thinking you can impress me with a load of technical jargon. I was an engineer myself, you know."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I'm gonna modify this here automaton so that it can transport goods and keep them safe from sin eaters."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)Pah! It won't be transporting much of anything with those stubby little arms, let alone fend off attackers."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)And even if it could store goods in its torso, by the time it's done windmilling into the bastards, all those wares will have been shaken to buggery. Good luck to the poor sods who have to sell <span class=\"emphasis\">that</span>."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Yeah, but the windmillin's the best part!"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Ronitt, the old woman has a point, you know."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)Less of the “old,” or I'll use that beard of yours to scrub the baths, with the rest of you still attached!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"So, we need a way to carry as much as possible while strikin' the sin eaters from a distance..."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"That's it! Everyone, gather round!"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)Wicked white... It's so old, the ink's probably the only thing holding it together."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"The design's from the days before the Flood, the brainchild of the great Watts himself. It's a self-propelled transportation device, armed to the teeth. I call it..."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"The Rollin' Tankard!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Its thick iron shell keeps the cargo inside safe and sound, while the cannon blasts any attackers to smithereens!"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"What an amazing coincidence that you've had the perfect solution in your pocket this whole time! Even before you knew what the problem was!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"This ain't no coincidence. Ever since I found a bunch of blueprints in a tightly locked safe back when I was little, I've taken them with me wherever I go. Never know when Watts's ideas might come in handy!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"'Course, I'm not just gonna make one of these, oh no. I'll make a whole bunch of 'em, and send them all over Norvrandt. Soon everyone'll see how great dwarven engineerin' really is!"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)But this only shows how it should look from the outside, with no mention of the inner workings. Are you sure you can pull this off?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I'd bet my beard on it!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"And to be honest, dwarven technology's come a long way since Watts's time. He probably didn't design the insides because there was no way to actually make somethin' like this back then."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Luckily, we've got my skills to bring Watts's ideas to life. I'll have a prototype up and runnin' in no time!"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Listen, Ronitt. You're not the only one who knows how to swing a hammer around here. If we combine our efforts, it'll be ready even sooner."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Cheers mate, 'preciate it."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)I must say, I'd be interested to see how this all turns out. I'll let you use my land, as long as you don't turn it into a smoldering crater."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"You won't regret this! But if we're to build a workshop, we'll need a few more pairs of hands. I'll head back to Tomra and round up some volunteers."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)Hold it right there!"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)If this place is going to be overrun with dwarves, at least give me some way to tell you apart."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"(-Lorathia-)How am I meant to know who's who if you all dress like that?"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Not sure if you realize this, madam, but we dwarves don't exactly have extensive wardrobes. But, in the interests of a smooth-running operation, I'll ask my friend Karutt if there's anything we can do."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Pff. So much for helpin'. More like “bugger off back to Tomra and leave poor Ronitt to do everythin' by himself!” Well, you're still here, so you can give me a hand instead. Let's go and take a look at this plot of land, shall we?"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"These hot springs look awfully...hot. I'd go for a dip myself, but I'm worried my head would boil inside my helmet! Taking it off first is out of the question, obviously."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Nothing better than a long soak in the springs, and Clearmelt has the best for malms around. It's a shame I can't have the whole place to myself!"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"That land used to belong to a relative of mine who moved to the Crystarium to get away from the sin eaters. Since then, I've been at a loss as to what to do with it. I'm not exactly inundated with potential tenants, as you can well imagine."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Welcome to the workshop! Or “workshop-to-be,” I suppose I should call it. Either way, this is where Watts's vision will become reality."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Although, I have to admit, it's not gonna be as easy as I've made out. Havin' you here does make the task seem less dauntin', though."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"And even though I was a bit miffed at first to hear you're into craftin' as well─stealin' my thunder and all that─I'm glad we've got somethin' in common."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"If you can lend a hand between whatever it is the Warrior of Darkness does the rest of the time, it'd mean the world to me."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"So, what do you say, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? Will you help me?"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"What the world needs now is tanks, sweet tanks. Of course I'll help."},{"name":"A3","text":"No. You talked yourself into this. Build your own damned tanks."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Ah. Not quite the answer I was hopin' for. Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Phew! I was worried you was gonna say no for a moment there! Now, let's make some tanks!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Erm, but before that, there are a few things we need to get in order. We won't get much work done without somethin' at least resemblin' a workshop."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"If you're in the mood for helpin', maybe you could rustle me up some basic parts? I've got a list of everythin' I need. Anyone with even a passin' interest in metalworkin' should be able to manage it, so I'm sure you'll be fine!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"If you're in the mood for helpin', maybe you could rustle me up some basic supplies?
