The suddenly panicked ancient sets her lecture aside, sending you west of the Mourning Dew to gather a handful of Archestratus flowers while she rushes off to make urgent culinary preparations.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","You have collected the requested Archestratus flowers. Convey the bouquet to Overseer Sokles as instructed.","You deliver the blooms to Overseer Sokles, who combines them with Charmion's handpicked fruits to create a tasty looking juice medley. He hands you the aether-rich beverage, and urges you to drink it on the spot.","You drink down the proffered juice, marveling at the complexity of its fruity and floral flavors. Charmion hovers nearby, obviously in need of reassurance that you won't suddenly fade into nothingness...","Satisfied that your corporeal form is no longer in danger of imminent dissipation, Charmion continues her lecture on the importance of proper nourishment and the evils of overindulgence.

One cannot perform at one's best without allowing the mind and the body time to recuperate."},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"Here on Anagnorisis, we often encourage one another to nap, or partake of some of the fruits we grow."},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"We could conjure such treats into existence, of course, but there is something oddly gratifying about plucking ripened fruit fresh from the tree..."},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"...Oh, how remiss of me! How exactly <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> you sustain yourself? Is Azem supplying you with aether?"},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"No? But you'll fade away without the proper nourishment! The tour can wait─we must feed you immediately!"},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"Would you mind picking some of the white blooms to the west of here and bringing them to Overseer Sokles? “Archestratus flowers,” we call them. I'll have everything else ready by the time you arrive!"},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"Archestratus flowers are an edible bloom, you see. Hand them to Overseer Sokles, and he'll mix them with the fruits I gathered to make a delicious juice!"},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"Charmion explained to me the “crisis” at hand. We cannot let you wither for lack of aether now, can we?"},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"Charmion explained to me the “crisis” at hand. Have you brought the flowers?"},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"Yes, yes, these are the ones we need. I'll add them to the fruits from Charmion's basket, and we'll soon have an aether-replenishing beverage for you to enjoy."},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"'Tis the work of but a moment..."},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"And here we are─freshly squeezed Anagnorisis juice medley!"},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"Go on, then, drink up. I am curious to hear what you think of it."},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"Please, have as much as you like. No need to be shy!"},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"Are you sure you're feeling all right? No sensations of gradual corporeal dissipation or the like?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You drink the juice, noting the complexities of the floral and fruity flavors..."},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"Ah, good─it seems you're able to tolerate liquid sustenance. You didn't appear to be suffering from any loss of material form, but a familiar must have a regular infusion of aetherial energy."},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"And now that we know you won't suddenly vanish, will you please reassure Charmion? She still looks terribly concerned."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Sokles wants you to drink the juice in his presence, so he can properly gauge your reaction..."},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"If you would be so kind as to put Charmion's fears to rest?"},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"I am so glad you were able to replenish your stores of aether! Overseer Sokles certainly is a wonder when it comes to food preparation."},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"Still, I firmly believe that the consumption of food should be limited to restoring one's strength. Any reason beyond that is simply wasteful."},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"Eating for enjoyment alone is an unnecessary drain on living resources, and such a practice can only be harmful to our star's equilibrium."},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"Which is why I have so much respect for Overseer Sokles and his culinary talent─he employs ingredients and methods which not only optimize a dish's aetherial concentration, but also produce flavorful results."},{"name":"SOKLES","text":"Save your compliments, Charmion. I won't be flattered into making another batch until it's time for our next meal."},{"name":"CHARMION","text":"W-Well, of course not!
