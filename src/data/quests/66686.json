Speak to Roehanth, but remember that one disturbs a man at his devotions at one's own peril.","Fortunately, you catch Roehanth at the end of his orisons, and the sight of the flowers in your hands disposes him favorably towards you. Place the spring stars on the grave.","The clean scent of spring stars lifts the gloom of this lonely place, and Roehanth's aspect loses much of that brooding look. There is a tale that brings the rough Roegadyn soldier to his knees thus, one you may learn yet by speaking to him.","Before Roehanth, a headstone. Under the stone, a settler named Aerghaemr who breathed his last not on his farm, but holding a trail against the Sahagin as his comrades made their escape. Such is the man that this sergeant and former corsair has chosen as his lodestar."],"objectives":["Speak with Sergeant Roehanth.","Place the flowers on the Founder's Crypt.","Speak with Sergeant Roehanth."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALYRLOE","text":"Where is Roehanth? I told that barnacle the engineers were letting us take the new cannon out for a test. The Twelve know when the mood will next strike those hugger-muggers.

You go fetch Roehanth, I'd be liable to profane the lichyard by beating him about his thick head with that big stone hourglass."},{"name":"ALYRLOE","text":"Ah, there I go again, blaspheming the Keeper. Not that I much cared for that poncey─and that's probably 'nother bit of abominating. Here, take these flowers. Roehanth's at the Founder's Crypt. Give him the pretties for the dead, that'll clear my slate with the gods."},{"name":"ROEHANTH","text":"Rest in the peace of the Twelve, Aerghaemr..."},{"name":"ROEHANTH","text":"Ah, you bring flowers! Come, no need to be shy, there's plenty of space. Small in life, he who sleeps here is large in death."},{"name":"ROEHANTH","text":"You'd never know now there was a hamlet here, would ye? Halfstone, 'twas called, built on the sweat of near ten score brows─and put to the Sahagin's torch. The settlers fought, aye, and how, with not a trained soldier among them."},{"name":"ROEHANTH","text":"Aerghaemr was one of those, a farmer by trade. He stayed behind to cover the final retreat, asking for as many arrows as could be spared. Then he took off his boots and gave 'em to another, saying it wasn't far where he was going. And here he lies now."},{"name":"ROEHANTH","text":"Time was, I'd be hard-pressed to imagine doing what he did. Ye don't hold fast to much in a privateer's life. No pirate cap'n's going down with her ship and any cap'n who looks to loyalty more than gold is liable to have his throat slit.<br>But now, I got to be better than that, don't I? I got to be more like Aerghaemr."}],"reward":{"gil":207,"xp":3500},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":16,"id":1}],"quests":[66684]},"next":[66687]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1003438","obj":{"i":1003438,"n":"Alyrloef","l":33,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1003475","obj":{"i":1003475,"n":"Roehanth","l":33,"q":2,"t":"Storm Sergeant"}},{"type":"quest","id":"66684","obj":{"i":66684,"n":"Toxic Avenger","g":91,"l":"Western La Noscea","s":160}},{"type":"quest","id":"66687","obj":{"i":66687,"n":"Scythe Extra Large","g":91,"l":"Western La Noscea","s":160}}]}
