Ginu Vanu agrees to return with you to Ok' Gundu Nakki without argument, but before you can leave a group of Vundu scouts appears nearby. Instead of resorting to violence, Linu Vali decides to scare the Vundu away with her sundrop dance─but first she needs inspiration. /dance for the timid Vanu to awaken the spirit of the warrior within her.","Your dancing rekindles Linu Vali's courage, and she puts on an impressive and terrifying display for the Vundu scouts, sending them running in fear. With your escape route secure, return to Ok' Zundu to introduce Ok' Gundu Nakki's new ally to the Zundu chieftain.","The Zundu chieftain and his attendant are excited to meet yet another of the Gundu's artisans, and Sonu Vanu is eager to see what changes this will bring to the village.
