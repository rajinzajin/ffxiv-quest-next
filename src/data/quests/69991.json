Nevertheless, what little insight you gained may prove to be beneficial, and so the two of you return to rendezvous with the other Scions.","After discussing the collected results of your investigations of the island and its inhabitants, prospects for a path forward appear grim, until Y'shtola posits a theory based on Meteion's assertion that emotions dictate reality in this dominion of dynamis. Following Thancred's example, she suspects you must overcome the powerful emotions that maintain the island's current state. Hearing this, Urianger suggests speaking with Al End, a dragon whose sorrow is perhaps most pronounced among his kin. Countering his despair may serve to alter the island, and create a path by which you may advance.","Estinien steps forward to confront Al End, and as their exchange grows more intense, something stirs within the timeworn dragon. With a terrible cry, he transforms into a small, black bird, and summons a swirling vortex that consumes Estinien. In the blink of an eye, another friend is lost, but in his wake a powerful wind begins to blow, and a path leading away from the island opens.","You and your comrades follow the wind, until you reach a cliff with a localized cyclone at its edge. Alphinaud bids you go on ahead, that he might have a moment to gather his thoughts.","Though Estinien is no more, he is still with you in spirit, as is Thancred. For their sake, and for all those who yet live on Etheirys, you press onward in search of Meteion."],"objectives":["Speak with Alphinaud.","Speak with Al End.","Speak with Alphinaud.","Touch the wind confluence and wait for the others at the designated location."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ELDERDRAGON04454","text":"......"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"They want only to brood in silence. To be left alone with their grief until time itself comes to an end."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"The sole reward for senseless bloodshed. A pain I understand...and wish that I did not."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"What fools we were..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But now isn't the time for such thoughts."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"The others will want to hear what we've learned. Come."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Good to see you made it back in one piece. The more I see of this place, the more bewildering it becomes."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I chanced to gain audience with several dragons ere we returned, though I expect their tales are much the same as those you heard."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"We would hear what the dragons had to share with you. Even if it's no different from what they told Urianger, it would have value."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Did your exploration prove eventful? Converse with any dragons?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"With luck, they'll have learned something to help us devise a plan of action."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Were you able to establish any meaningful contact with the dragons?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I see... They wish to escape what they perceive to be a cycle of conflict."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Estinien."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"As for our part, I believe we are more acutely aware of our confines than before..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We started by traversing the perimeter of the island, to see if there might be a path leading off of it. Sadly, there was nothing to be found."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"There's no small amount of debris floating about. Could there be enough to serve as a bridge to lead us elsewhere?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I considered that, and so I tried throwing a stone onto a potential platform to judge its integrity..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But it never reached its mark. As it crossed an invisible threshold just beyond the boundaries of this island, it vanished, only to reappear above me, and fall at my feet. I would not be too quick to presume that what we see outside this space is as it appears."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Which is why I returned to the <span class=\"emphasis\">Ragnarok</span>, and asked the Loporrits to search for a potential path."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"However, the ship's instruments failed to provide conclusive data on the surrounding area. Until we know more, I think it too risky to attempt flying to another island."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"What Meteion told us before─that emotions dictate reality here─might be the key. But I'm not entirely sure what emotion might manifest a bridge to lead us to safety."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"So what you're saying is, we've no way forward."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"At present, aye. If it is indeed emotion that governs this island, perhaps it is not Meteion's, but the dragons' that holds us here."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"They tire of conflict, and have chosen a path of oblivion to escape it."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Or rather, they have chosen no path at all. Meaning there is no way for the dragons, or anyone here on this island, to advance."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"A sound theory, disheartening though it may be."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If that is the case, what recourse do we have? They are not like to be persuaded to help us."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Their reasoning is built on a history of turmoil and strife. Without irrefutable proof the future is not as bleak as they believe it to be..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Mayhap persuasion is not the answer."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Meteion meant to unmake us then and there on the <span class=\"emphasis\">Ragnarok</span>, and she would have succeeded if not for Thancred's determination."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"She conceded it was strong enough to overpower the despair that otherwise rules Ultima Thule, and reshape it to a degree. Perhaps it can be done again in like manner─by overpowering the prevailing emotions."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"'Twas Ultima Thule's architect, Meteion herself, against whom Thancred did pit himself in a clash of wills. Though I marked no leader among them, as such, I did chance to encounter a dragon possessed of despair far more potent than most. Potent enough, mayhap, to dictate the course for others─and thus, their domain, to follow."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"He spoke but few words, carefully chosen, their tone and timber alone threatening to rend my heart in twain. Challenging his desire to remain may allow us to alter the island upon which we stand."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Alas, I fear my vaunted rhetoric availed me naught against his calcifying heart. But mayhap one of you will fare better...?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Then I shall guide thee. Al End, they call him, in the dragon tongue. Thou wilt find him nearby, eyes fixed upon the water."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, what have we to lose? Let's get going."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"If I had known this place would claim Estinien too, I..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"No... No, it's what had to be done."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"As by the beating of mighty wings doth wind blow, where dragons may ne'er again touch the sky, he and the shade he bore shall soar free..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Must this always be the price paid for safe passage?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"The wind has stayed the fog that covered this island. And the air... It no longer feels quite so stifling."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"A confluence of wind has manifested before you..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Look there! The wind..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"This is Estinien's doing. I'm sure of it. We should ride its flow, and see where it leads."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Forgive me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but could you go on ahead? I... I need a moment. To gather my thoughts..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"A powerful gale has delivered you to another island. The other Scions should arrive before long."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"He...he did it. He found a way forward for us."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The dragons remain trapped within a prison of their own making, lamenting the horrors of war. Yet Estinien knew them better than most."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"He was a man of honor and a dear friend, willing to fight to the very end for what he believed was right..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And he's still fighting, Alphinaud. Just like Thancred."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Their sacrifices are why we can survive here. Why we still have a chance to stop her."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Even in spirit, they're unwilling to give in to despair, and we mustn't either."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Alisaie is right.
