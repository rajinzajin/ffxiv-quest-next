That's why we are strictly warned against going to Phisor Lran."},{"name":"LADKENN","text":"Yet though we know to fear the beaver, we know little and less about it. Whence did it come and to what end does it make us disappear? The creature is shrouded in mystery. What could possibly be its desire...?"},{"name":"LADKENN","text":"It wants milk, you say?
