What's more, it seems that some of our youngbloods are meeting him in secret."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"No doubt you'll want to question them about their trysts, but they are not like to yield the information readily to an outsider. If you tell them I sent you, though, they may well feel obliged to talk."},{"name":"WALDHAR","text":"...A masked man? No idea what yer talkin' about. I ain't done nothin' wrong, so leave me be."},{"name":"ADALIND","text":"G-Gundobald sent you? I, uh─ Listen, I <span class=\"emphasis\">told</span> them it was a bad idea!

I ought to know, for it once burned within me as well."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"Two decades ago, that same anger drove me and my brothers to rise against the despot who ruled Ala Mhigo. Naught would do but to depose him and usher in a revolution. Well, we got our revolution all right...but it cost us our freedom."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"Blinded by our hate, we didn't realize that we had been dancing to the Empire's tune. By the time we did, it was too late. Ala Mhigo had fallen."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"There are times when a man must be patient. Now is such a time, though the young ones know this not.
