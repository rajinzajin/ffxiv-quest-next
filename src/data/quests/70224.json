I have good tidings─the melodies of the musicking station appear to have struck a proverbial chord with a number of our Ways, who have incidentally come to me with a request."},{"name":"MANAGINGWAY","text":"The music awoke something in them─the desire to play an instrument themselves. Naturally, we must nurture these burgeoning embers of passion within their hearts in a timely fashion, lest they be extinguished. I trust I can count on you?"},{"name":"MANAGINGWAY","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! It seems even more of our Ways have developed an interest in playing an instrument.

Wouldn't you know it─after hearing us play our new instruments, a bunch of our fellow Ways are now hoping to join us.
