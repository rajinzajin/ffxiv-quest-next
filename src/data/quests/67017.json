The moogle meant no harm, I'm sure, but this marks the third time this past fortnight I've found myself in possession of a delivery intended for another."},{"name":"KLYNTHOTA","text":"I do not expect all moogles to be well versed in Roegadyn naming conventions. But when they are unsure of the intended recipient, could they at least have the courtesy to <span class=\"emphasis\">ask</span> before dumping it off and flitting away unseen?"},{"name":"KLYNTHOTA","text":"Look closely, here: this missive is clearly marked for my brother, Ryssfloh Skarnfrusk<span class=\"emphasis\">syn</span>. He makes his home in Limsa, and serves on guard duty at the Octant more often than not."},{"name":"KLYNTHOTA","text":"I've a mind to send this letter right back where it came from, but my confidence in those furballs wears thin.

I remember when you were just another wide-eyed whelp fresh off the boat. Reckoned this city would eat you alive, but I'm glad to see you've proven me wrong."},{"name":"RYSSFLOH","text":"If you're lost, you'd best get found─and quickly.

Well, isn't that just bloody brilliant! Perhaps next time those bloody furballs could just forward all of my personal correspondence to the Admiral herself─I daresay the consequences would be less dire."},{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"(-???-)A hundred, a thousand─no, a hundred thousand apologies, my good sir!"},{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"I am most profusely, profoundly sorry for the terrible inconvenience I have caused.

In the flesh!? Well, if this isn't a rare occasion! Har har!"},{"name":"RYSSFLOH","text":"...And Llymlaen take me if you aren't a cute little bugger!

It would appear I owe you my thanks, tall one! But where are my manners? Allow me to introduce myself─I am a delivery moogle."},{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"Oh, I know what you're thinking. “Moogles are supposed to hide in trees and avoid contact with outsiders! Why ever would they agree to carry about letters?”"},{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"\"Why\" indeed! If I had <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> way, I'd be curled up under the canopy of a nice oak dreaming about some beautiful mooglette with a rainbow-colored pom-pom, kupo!"},{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"But <span class=\"emphasis\">no</span>, the moon had to go and drop from the sky, causing all of that terrible commotion! Aetherytes were shattered and linkpearls rendered useless. For moons, the poor, wingless people of Eorzea had no way of communicating with each other.<br>...Beyond screaming at the top of their lungs, that is─which no one really approved of, kupo."},{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"That is, until the little horned ones asked us to assist them by delivering messages.
