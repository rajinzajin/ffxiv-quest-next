Strangely, however, the Illuminati Grand Master seems wholly unconcerned, prompting Biggs and Wedge to wonder aloud if he had reckoned on you succeeding. They recall with a start that Quickthinx was pursuing a mysterious “missing piece,” and that goblin troops might be rushing towards Idyllshire in search of it now.
