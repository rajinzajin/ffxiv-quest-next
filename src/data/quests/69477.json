Having recently reclaimed Utya's Aegis, an outpost on the southern front, Marsak has asked Sjeros to escort you there, that you might assess the situation for yourself.","With little preamble, Sjeros agrees to guide you to Utya's Aegis, where Bajsaljen plans to introduce you to a rather remarkable group of soldiers.","Bajsaljen is proud to present to you the new Gunnhildr's Blades, though the members present do not comprise the guard in its entirety. The remaining members have already taken to the field, laboring to advance the front line toward the castrum. Having thus explained the situation, it occurs to Bajsaljen that you have yet to see the fortress with your own eyes. Seeking to rectify this, he invites you to look out over the battlefield and behold the object of their struggles.","As you look upon the castrum, towering in the distance, Bajsaljen speaks to you of their initiative to reclaim it, Operation Eagle's Nest. Before you join his troops in the field, however, he asks that you speak with Mikoto.","You find Mikoto in the company of Misija, and they have exciting news to share─an analysis of the crystal focus has proven that it can be recharged. The problem, however, is the means to do so requires infiltrating imperial territory. Nevertheless, plans to restore the crystal focus are well underway. Plans that will require your assistance to succeed.","Mikoto appears fearful of the dangers yet to come, but she understands that you both must do what needs be done. She bids you safe travels as you ready to brave the Bozjan southern front."],"objectives":["Speak with Sjeros.","Make for the Bozjan southern front and speak with Bajsaljen.","Speak with Bajsaljen.","Speak with Mikoto."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"It is good to see you, my friend. Though it came at great cost, I am pleased to say Master Gerolt has succeeded in reforging the weapons of Gunnhildr's Blades. Indeed, the queen's illustrious guard has at last been reborn."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"When the deed was done, word quickly spread to every faction of the Bozjan Resistance. As we had hoped, it has reaffirmed their resolve to press on and see our home returned to its former glory."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"In fact, our troops have already reclaimed Utya's Aegis, an outpost in the Bozjan southern front. When you are ready, I would ask you make for the front lines to better assess the situation for yourself.

The fury of his art rivals even the fieriest hells.<br>Isolde, the eagle eye. In brightest day or darkest night, no enemy will escape her sight.<br>Stanik, the unwavering blade of Bozja. The foes dashed against his shield are beyond counting."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Velibor, the baleful blade. His unbridled fury can fell entire cadres with a single stroke.<br>Aggie, the iron fist of Bozja. A young prodigy whose martial skills put even those most seasoned veterans to shame.<br>Blaz, the merciful blade. No foe, however terrible, will dissuade his blade from finding its mark."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Rest assured, this is not the guard in its entirety. A number have already taken to the field and would benefit greatly from your presence, if you are willing."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"With Gunnhildr's Blades and the Warrior of Light leading the charge, it is only a matter of time before Castrum Lacus Litore is ours."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Speaking of which, I believe you have yet to see the castrum. If you'll follow me, I'll show you the object of our struggle here on the southern front."},{"name":"XEVEN","text":"Blade <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. It is an honor and privilege to make your acquaintance. I very much look forward to fighting at your side in the days to come."},{"name":"ISOLDE","text":"Pleased to meet you, Blade <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. When the battle is joined, rest assured Gunnhildr's Blades will be at your back."},{"name":"STANIK","text":"Hahaha, at last we meet, Blade <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. Let us give the imperials a good thrashing, yes?"},{"name":"BLAZ","text":"Blade <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. You honor us with your presence.

Castrum Lacus Litore, to use the Garlean moniker."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Its true name is Alermuc, which means “eagle” in Bozjan, as they too once made their home in these mountains. To our people they are a symbol of strength and good fortune, both of which were sorely needed when the Empire first invaded."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"But we needn't dwell on past failings. Now we have a chance to reclaim what is rightfully ours. To remind the people what it is we stand to gain, I have chosen to call this initiative “Operation Eagle's Nest.”"},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Like the great eagle we must strike hard and swift. And with you at our side, I have no doubt we shall see this through to a glorious end."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"But before you rush into battle, I believe Mikoto wished to discuss the crystal focus with you. Good tidings, perhaps?"},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Mikoto requested you speak with her as soon as possible. Something to do with the crystal focus, I believe."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"I have rather exciting news to share. As you may recall, the energies of the crystal focus were spent on our exploration of Cid's memories."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"After careful analysis, we have concluded that it can, in fact, absorb aether in a similar fashion to the auracite we discovered in Ivalice."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"This assumes, of course, we have a suitable source of energy matching its aetherial frequency."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"And therein lies the problem. Crystals bearing such a specific aetherial signature are quite rare. We could never hope to amass the quantities needed."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Were we to locate an aether current of the correct frequency, however, charging the focus would be a matter of course. Unfortunately, such currents exist only in regions of Bozja rife with imperials."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Mikoto wished to wait until the fighting died down, but as I explained to her before, time is a luxury we can ill afford."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"I'm sure you understand better than anyone that the bloodshed will only cease when a victor is decided, the death toll climbing ever higher on both sides."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"The horrors of this war weigh heavy on the hearts of our people."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"A burden which could be eased were we able to employ the crystal focus, healing wounds not of the flesh, but of the mind."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Plans to locate an aether current are well underway, but I suspect your help would see them expedited. Might we ask for your assistance in this endeavor?"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Pressed for time as we are, Cid has already begun work on a monitoring device to locate a sufficient source of aether."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"I would join him and see to the final preparations. In the meantime, I would ask the two of you to investigate a location I believe to be near an aether current."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Sorry for interrupting, but a few of our soldiers wished to have a quick word before you depart. I expect their intelligence will prove useful when you're in the field."},{"name":"RESISTANCERECORDER","text":"Blade <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. Might I speak with you before you leave for the southern front?
