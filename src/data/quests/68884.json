Might I beg your assistance with a small matter?"},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"A friend of mine has recently joined the guard, you see. I was hoping to put my skills to work in crafting her armor more durable than the standard-issue fare, but she's already been stationed out in Lakeland."},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"I have her measurements, of course, but I find myself unsure of which parts of the garment will need to be reinforced, and which will need to hang a bit loose for mobility's sake. Would you be willing to demonstrate a few common stances for me?"},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"Thank you! In that case, could you begin by showing me your usual <span class=\"highlight\">battle stance</span>?"},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"You needn't be self-conscious─just move how you usually do."},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"Hmm... I may need to add a bit more give around the shoulders. Would you mind throwing a few punches as well? As if you were <span class=\"highlight\">boxing</span>."},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"This perhaps goes without saying, but you needn't actually hit anyone. I only wish to see how you move when you throw a punch."},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"I see─the entire torso needs to be able to twist. And the knuckle portion of the gloves could likely use a bit more padding..."},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"I believe I understand what alterations to make. You've been a great help─thank you."},{"name":"CRAFTSMAN03348","text":"I must say that what you're wearing seems quite finely made, but if ever you do find yourself in need of new equipment, come and find me. I would be happy to offer you a reduced rate on my custom work!"}],"reward":{"gil":679,"items":[{"id":26833}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}],"quests":[68817]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1029884","obj":{"i":1029884,"n":"Astute Artisan","l":2951,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"26833","obj":{"i":26833,"n":"White Oak Bracelet Coffer (IL 385)","l":1,"c":26566,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"68817","obj":{"i":68817,"n":"Travelers of Norvrandt","g":8,"l":"The Crystarium","s":30}}]}
