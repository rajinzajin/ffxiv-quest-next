Mogzin informs you that Tarresson and Ohl Deeh wish to share words with you. Hopefully this time they do not concern matters of work.","Both Ohl Deeh and Tarresson thank you for your help during the long project, and both declare their intent to remain with the Mogmenders for the foreseeable future. They will labor to repair Zenith, and say that your aid─and company─will always be welcome with open arms.","Mogzin expresses his sincerest gratitude for all of your hard work and tutelage. Looking to the future, he says that the Mogmenders will soon begin work on Zenith proper, and hopes that the lessons learned at Bahrr Lehs will aid them in that endeavor. Mogzin reluctantly bids you farewell, and assures you that there will always be an extra set of tools ready should you ever wish join the moogles again."],"objectives":["Speak with Tarresson.","Speak with Ohl Deeh.","Speak with Master Mogzin."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOGZIN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, everyone's been asking for you, kupo! You'd better speak with Ohl Deeh and Master Tarresson to see what they want."},{"name":"MOGZIN","text":"Master Tarresson and Ohl Deeh are eager to speak with you, kupo! I wonder what they want?"},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"There you are, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Do not look so tense, my friend. For once this does not concern our difficulties repairing the plaza."},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"On the contrary, I simply wish to offer you my sincerest gratitude for your help thus far. You have given this old man a meaningful way to spend his days, and thanks to the efforts of all and sundry, I have recaptured a piece of my family's history."},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"Yes, <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> family. For although House Dzemael is now renowned for its skill at stonemasonry, that was not always the case. No, as recently as three centuries ago, we were but humble crafters."},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"It was not until a lord of House Dzemael married the daughter of a minor lord─whose house was known for its deep knowledge of architecture─that the first brick of our renown was laid. That maiden's family name was Faurechort."},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"A name which rings familiar, yes? One of the three original architects of Bahrr Lehs: Marinche de Faurechort. His blood courses through the veins of every son and daughter of House Dzemael, and his teachings have enriched our lives."},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"To think that after more than a thousand years, ancestor and descendant would be joined by the same work of art. Nymeia must surely be smirking at Her own cleverness. Regardless, I am grateful for whatever whims of fate have led me to this moment."},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"Ah, but enough of sentimentality! I have come to a decision. Until the day I draw my last breath, I shall continue on here and guide the Mogmenders. Of course, you are always welcome should you wish to offer a helping hand."},{"name":"TARRESSON","text":"I never did feel entirely comfortable among the stiff nobility of Ishgard, and I doubt I shall be sorely missed. Certainly many will bid good riddance to me, but it does not matter. The feeling shall be mutual!"},{"name":"OHLDEEH","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, greetings! Quite the impressive work, wouldn't you agree?"},{"name":"OHLDEEH","text":"When Mogzin first told me about Bahrr Lehs, I was sure nothing would ever get done. I certainly never dreamed he would go so far as to receive Gullinbursti's praise!"},{"name":"OHLDEEH","text":"If not for you and Tarresson, Mogzin would still be caught up in trying to avoid work. I thank you for keeping by his side through all of this, and I look forward to seeing what works the Mogmenders produce in the future."},{"name":"OHLDEEH","text":"As for me, I have no pressing engagements for the next hundred years, after which I will go into hibernation. Until then, I plan on remaining here to help with the repair of Zenith. If you find yourself back here sometime within the next century, be sure to say hello!"},{"name":"OHLDEEH","text":"After all of our hard work, I've come to understand why Gullinbursti felt so attached to this place. Perhaps in a thousand years, I'll look upon Bahrr Lehs with a similar fondness."},{"name":"MOGZIN","text":"You're back, kupo! Now that you've heard everyone else's thanks, it's my turn! Thank you!"},{"name":"MOGZIN","text":"The Mogmenders still have much work ahead, and soon we'll begin repairing Zenith proper."},{"name":"MOGZIN","text":"No doubt we'll face difficulties that'll make repairing this plaza look as simple as painting a pebble.
