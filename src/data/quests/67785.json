Deeming you a trustworthy courier, Roundrox bids you deliver the item to her friend, who can oft be found gazing at the steel colossus from the remains of a nearby bridge. Seek out Mide and hand over the goblin girl's pride and joy.","You find Mide overlooking the steel colossus, and although she is hesitant to accept the codex fragment at first, she finally concedes it may be for the best. The treasure hunter subsequently reveals that only a select few are able to view the contents of the codex, and that Roundrox is one of them. Determined that the Illuminati should not uncover this truth, Mide plans to draw their attention away from the girl, hoping that they will follow whoever holds the fragment. Just as Mide finishes her explanation, Backrix appears bearing word from Wedge. It would seem he urgently requires your presence at Bigwest Shortstop. Return to the outpost and hear what news the engineer has to share with you.","Wedge hurriedly explains that Y'shtola has detected high volumes of aether being drawn into Alexander from the surrounding land, indicating that the Illuminati have resumed their efforts to awaken the primal. To make matters worse, the goblins are also reported to be amassing explosives and supplies in what appears to be an attempt to create a new weapon. Undaunted, Wedge intends to strike at the Illuminati before they can launch their offensive, and enthusiastically proclaims that you are essential to the success of his stratagem. With that, he scurries off to meet Biggs at their chosen rendezvous point, doubtless expecting you to follow him.","Shortly after you join Biggs, Wedge appears with Cid and Y'shtola in tow. Y'shtola is keen to observe the unusual fluctuations in aetheric energy, while Cid has been enlisted to offer advice on the plan of attack. With the team duly assembled, Wedge unveils a new invention: a device which he plans to use to throw Illuminati communications into disarray, affording you an opportunity to take them unawares. Upon activating the device, however, another of Alexander's giant limbs screeches into life, coming to rest on the opposite bank of the Thaliak. Though all has not gone quite to plan, it seems the hatch to the left arm is momentarily unguarded, and your comrades bid you take advantage of the chaos caused by the colossus's sudden awakening to enter while you still hold the element of surprise. Hurry across the Thaliak and speak with Lightkix Eyesfixed who guards the bank where Alexander's arm chanced to fall.","You find Lightkix Eyesfixed dutifully standing watch over the entrance to the dormant primal. With your allies at your side, venture into the labyrinth of steam and steel and put a stop to the Illuminati's latest scheme.<br><br>※The Fist of the Son can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","After a series of fierce battles against foes both old and new, you succeed in thwarting the Illuminati's nefarious plans. Return to Bigwest Shortstop and share news of your victory.","After congratulating you on your victory, Biggs delivers some disconcerting news. While patrolling the area, he and Wedge chanced to see Mide handing over the codex fragment to the Illuminati. As the three of you ponder the treasure hunter's actions, Quickthinx Allthoughts appears, apparently intent on explaining matters. He declares that Mide was an ally of the Illuminati all along, and makes several cryptic remarks implying that everything is proceeding exactly as it should. Though all present find his claims hard to believe, Backrix reveals that an expedition of Au Ra set forth to investigate the ruins near the Thaliak River some three years before. Furthermore, he says that the author of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Enigma Codex</span> was an Auri Xaela with the same hair color as Mide. Despite these revelations, Roundrox refuses to believe that her friend had any part in the purported treachery, and rushes off to look for her. You can only hope the young goblin does not stray too far, as the Illuminati are certain to return ere long."],"objectives":["Search for Mide and deliver the glowstone to her.","Speak with Wedge.","Speak with Biggs.","Speak with Lightkix Eyesfixed.","Enter the Fist of the Son.","Report to Biggs."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ROUNDROX","text":"Pshkohhh...

"},{"name":"MIDE","text":"And yet...it may be safer in the hands of one more capable of defending it... Safer for all concerned. Gods know the Illuminati will stop at nothing to get it.

Yet it had been handled many times by others, yourself included, without ever betraying a hint of the secret contained within. Did you not find that strange?"},{"name":"MIDE","text":"I myself was surprised─albeit for a different reason. The codex is protected by an arcane mechanism, you see. Only those who share its fundamental principles are able to view its contents. It is rare indeed to find an individual with the qualities required to read it."},{"name":"MIDE","text":"That Roundrox possesses such qualities is an unexpected blessing, to be sure, but if the Illuminati were to learn of her secret, she would be placed in grave danger."},{"name":"MIDE","text":"Even as we speak, they scour the hinterlands in search of their elusive “missing piece,” but as far as I know, they still view our friend as a mere collector of misplaced items."},{"name":"MIDE","text":"For her sake, we must do our utmost to draw their attention away from Bigwest Shortstop, before they take it into their heads to return.

The giant's innards are well-nigh saturated with aether already. Yet I sense something else... An irregular energy coming from within the barrier."},{"name":"CID","text":"Be that as it may, I'm afraid we have more pressing concerns. The Illuminati are up to something, and we mean to hit them before they can put whatever it is they're planning into action."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"To which end─allow me to introduce my newest and perhaps most astounding invention...<br>...The Electrojammer III, first of its kind!"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"Speechless with astonishment, I see.

With the Illuminati hard at work reviving the giant, 'twas only a matter of time before parts of it started springing to life. You just gave this one a little extra nudge. On a brighter note, it would seem you've saved us the trouble of finding another way in."},{"name":"CID","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, old friend─it's time for your customary heroics! The Illuminati are likely still scrambling to work out what just happened.

I'll wager the Illuminati don't know which way up they are in there!

While Wedge and I were out on patrol, we saw something, you see... A meeting...between Mide and the enemy."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"...And then she handed the codex fragment over, just like that! The way she sauntered back into Alexander with the Illuminati, you'd think this was their plan all along!"},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"It certainly looks that way, aye... But we can't rule out the possibility of coercion, considering the parties involved."},{"name":"QUICKTHINXALLTHOUGHTS","text":"Pshhhkohhh... Foolish uplanders!

If the Grand Master of the Illuminati said it, it <span class=\"emphasis\">must</span> be true!"},{"name":"QUICKTHINXALLTHOUGHTS","text":"Pshhhkohhh... Everything is as written. As it must be. If Illuminati are to guide chosen to perfect world, not one piece can be out of place."},{"name":"QUICKTHINXALLTHOUGHTS","text":"With this, another page becomes reality. When Illuminati find missing piece, the prophecy will be fulfilled."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"...Goodness me! That goblin hasn't the faintest idea how uplanders' minds work. I would have been prepared to believe that Mide was a traitor had he not bothered to come here and confirm it. Now I'm inclined to think she isn't!"},{"name":"BACKRIX","text":"Pssshkoh...

That wouldn't be the earthquake that accompanied the failed summoning of that primal, would it? Bugger me... Are you saying it was the treasure hunters doing the summoning? ...And that Mide was one of them?"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"Now hold on a moment. I'm willing to accept that Mide may have been a member of this doomed expedition─she being an Auri treasure hunter and all─but I fail to see what interest such a group would have in the ideals of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Enigma Codex</span>, let alone summoning a primal..."},{"name":"BACKRIX","text":"Pssshkoh...
