Head to Tenkonto and speak with the samurai Gyosei.","You meet with Gyosei, and he explains that he requires a helm for participation in a tournament known as the gozen-jiai. Blanstyr proposes a friendly contest where you both craft a piece, and have the client decide which he likes best. Return to Kokajiya, and discuss the subject of supplies with Unryu.","Before you begin forging, Unryu suggests that you first ask the advice of those with more intimate knowledge of the gozen-jiai. He sends you to speak with the same Sekiseigumi blade you consulted once before, as well as a stallkeeper in the Rakuza District.","After speaking with the blade and the stallkeeper, you learn that a simple somen─a faceplate which protects the head from brow to jaw─is considered the most appropriate headgear for the tournament. Head back to Unryu, and make a request for materials.","Unryu hands over the supplies you need. Deliver your finished work to Fugetsu when the somen is complete.<br><br>※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Unryu.","You deliver your work to Fugetsu, and the master puts it on display next to Blanstyr's piece. Much to Blanstyr's surprise, however, Gyosei chooses your simple somen over your fellow apprentice's elaborate kabuto. Fugetsu chides Blanstyr for prioritizing a selfish desire to express originality over meeting the client's practical requirements, and the veteran artisan admits his fault. Continue your lessons alongside the repentant Blanstyr, and work towards perfecting the arts you have learned in Kokajiya.<br><br>※The next armorer quest will be available from Blanstyr upon reaching level 70."],"objectives":["Speak with Gyosei.","Speak with Unryu.","Speak with the Sekiseigumi blade.","Speak with the sunny stallkeeper.","Speak with Unryu.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize a tournament somen <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"></span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the tournament somen <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Fugetsu</span></span>."],"dialogue":[{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, is it not? How are you finding your apprenticeship here in Kokajiya?"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"From the looks of things, you have developed a solid mastery of the fundamentals. Yes, I think mayhap it is time we honed your skills with a more practical task─I would have you accept a commission from one of our patrons."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"As fortune would have it, one of the samurai families has requested our services. Fulfilling this request shall serve as your next lesson."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"A welcome challenge. So where can we find this client of yers?"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"A meeting has been arranged to take place in Tenkonto. The client is a “Master Gyosei”─listen attentively, and expend every effort to satisfy his wishes."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Consider it done.<br>Come on, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Let's go an' meet with this Master Gyosei."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Master Gyosei will meet you in Tenkonto. I trust that this commission will prove a most enlightening experience."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"This must be the bloke. I've never worked for an honest-to-gods samurai before..."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Ho there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. How's yer craft comin' along, then?"},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"Yes, I am Gyosei. What would you have of me, ijin?"},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"Ah, forgive my brusque manner! I did not expect... Ahem, and just how long have you two been studying with Master Fugetsu?"},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"...But recently arrived from Eorzea, you say!? And just newly apprenticed? How wonderful that your instruction in Hingan methods coincides with my most urgent request..."},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"No matter! I shall place my trust in your skill, as Master Fugetsu has clearly done. As for my request, I need you to craft for me new headgear for the gozen-jiai."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"For the...“goh-zen-jee-eye”?"},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"Yes, the gozen-jiai. It is a tournament of sorts, where samurai display their prowess with a blade before members of the nobility. An exceptional performance can earn one a most lucrative appointment."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Ah, so yer lookin' to impress a future employer. Don't ye worry, sir─ye've put yerself in capable hands."},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"Glad I am to hear such confidence! I expect naught less than perfection from an apprentice of Master Fugetsu!"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"What say we have ourselves a little contest, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? I reckon we both have a go at makin' a piece for our client here, an' see whose work he likes best."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"An' maybe if Master Fugetsu thinks me design is good enough, then I can skip all this basic rubbish an' move on to learnin' how to make me style more distinct."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Let's head back an' pick up some supplies from Unryu."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Master Gyosei, sir, we'll be gettin' to work on yer commission now. If ye don't mind, I'd like ye to stop by Kokajiya once it's finished."},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"Very good! I shall await word of my armor's completion, then!"},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"I am most anxious to behold what two Eorzean armorers might craft at a Hingan forge!"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"This tournament seems like a major event. Gyosei'll want to stand out from the crowd..."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"You spoke with our client? Then I trust that you will forge the piece to his satisfaction."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Blanstyr tells me you are to compete for the client's favor."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"I wonder, however, if you are familiar with the gozen-jiai and what might be considered preferable armor. Before you begin, why not ask the advice of those with the relevant experience?"},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"One such person might be the Sekiseigumi blade who shared with you his ideas on the perfect kote. He will have participated in the tournament in question, and is thus in possession of an invaluable perspective."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Another fine choice would be a stallkeeper in the Rakuza District. Such a merchant will have traded in many types of armor, and could provide you with a broader range of ideas."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Let me know when you have decided on a piece, and I shall plunder our stores for you. ...Master Fugetsu does not like it when I use words such as “plunder.”"},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Speak with the blade and the stallkeeper before you decide what to forge. I shall be waiting to <span class=\"emphasis\">procure</span> you the necessary materials."},{"name":"SAMURAIBUGYO02597","text":"Ah, well if it isn't my fellow kote enthusiast! You were able to forge a fine pair of gauntlets, I trust?"},{"name":"ZOUSENOTOKO02597","text":"I see, and this time you are to craft headgear for a gozen-jiai participant. First and foremost, the tournament takes place before a significant gathering of the nobility. As such, it is best to avoid ostentatious designs or gaudy color combinations."},{"name":"ZOUSENOTOKO02597","text":"When I myself joined the tournament, I also found it advantageous to wear a facemask which allowed a wide field of vision. That is all I can tell you of armor─your client's success will otherwise rely upon his own skill."},{"name":"SHONIN02597","text":"Closer, my friend! Come closer! See anything you like?"},{"name":"SHONIN02597","text":"Eh? Headgear for the gozen-jiai? Well, each combatant has his preferences, but most will choose a facemask of some kind. There's the hatsuburi which protects the brow and cheeks, and the somen─a fuller version which stretches further down and across the jaw."},{"name":"SHONIN02597","text":"I've seen warriors who bind their head with naught but a hachimaki...and I've seen the same warriors carried out with cracked skulls. A strip of cloth affords poor protection, you'll find."},{"name":"ZOUSENOTOKO02597","text":"Remember to avoid gaudy designs and colors─such choices are considered tasteless when courting noble employers. Also keep in mind that a warrior appreciates an unrestricted view of the battlefield."},{"name":"SHONIN02597","text":"You cannot go wrong with a standard facemask. Even in a tournament, a blow to a naked brow can be dangerous..."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Have you decided on the piece you wish to forge?"},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"A somen, is it? Very well. One moment and I'll see what we have..."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Ah, this should do nicely. Here!"},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"As always, I will replace your materials should you happen to slip with your hammer. I am a generous quartermaster. Oh, and I believe you are to present your work to Master Fugetsu when it is ready."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"If you find yourself in need of more materials, simply ask and I will rummage through my magical shelves. Otherwise you can present your finished work directly to Master Fugetsu."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"That is a sturdy-looking somen. Well done. You should probably show it to Master Fugetsu instead of me though."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Blanstyr has explained to me that you plan to have the client choose between his and your work. Do you have your piece ready?"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"I see you have chosen to craft a somen. I am very curious indeed to witness the outcome of this little...contest."},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"Oh! Are both these pieces for my commission!?"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Aye, but I'll not say who made which. Ye just pick the one what catches yer fancy, sir."},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"Hmmm...<br>I have made my decision!"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Right, let's hear it, then."},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"I shall take this somen!"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Now hang on a bloody moment! Yer choosin' the somen over me silver snake kabuto!?"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"But...surely ye can't pass up the helm what protects yer whole head!"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"An' look at that serpent head! It's a symbol o' good fortune over here, ain't it!? Not to mention how such an original design'll catch the eye of yer prospective employers!"},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"The gozen-jiai is a tournament─not a life-or-death battle. While certain precautions must still be taken, it is not needful nor desirable to don the heaviest armors available."},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"And when fighting before the nobility, it is considered tactless to draw attention with aught besides one's skill with the blade. A simple facemask is sufficient to put one's mind in the right frame for battle."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"But ye didn't... Can't ye just─"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Enough, apprentice! The client has decided, and the matter is settled!"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Furthermore, it would seem you are in need of instruction regarding the “original” design of your kabuto."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"You once confided in me that the sight of a Heavensturn helmet drove you to seek originality in your own work."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"I fear, however, that you misunderstand the motive behind the uniqueness of those designs."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"The Heavensturn helmets were crafted to reflect the desire of the bugyo to introduce those animals to Eorzea, and foster a fondness for our sacred symbols."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"They were not, as you seem to believe, created to exhibit my own personal style as an armorer."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Your efforts to learn and incorporate our culture into your work, and the exquisite detail of the kabuto's embellishments are worthy of praise."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"But such grand achievements are meaningless if the resulting piece fails to satisfy the needs and expectations of the client."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"...Yer right, Master Fugetsu. Seems that ever since I saw that helm, I've been obsessed with creatin' summat with the same impact..."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"In me rush to find me own style, I've gone an' forgotten what I learned about tailorin' me work to the client. I've wasted yer time, Master Gyosei, an' I beg yer forgiveness."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Thank ye, Master Fugetsu, for bringin' me to me senses. If ye'll still have me as yer apprentice, it seems I could do with a few more lessons..."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Of course, Blanstyr. I would make a poor teacher indeed were I to turn away a student so willing to make improvements."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Master Gyosei. I, too, offer my apologies for this misunderstanding."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"You must be eager to try on <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s somen. We thank you for your patronage, and pray that your efforts at the gozen-jiai meet with resounding success."},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"Your well-wishes are much appreciated! You should be proud to have such talented apprentices!"},{"name":"GYOSEI","text":"May fortune smile upon your forge!"}],"reward":{"gil":917,"items":[{"num":250,"id":9},{"id":19561},{"id":5703,"one":1},{"id":5708,"one":1},{"id":5713,"one":1}],"xp":2902500},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":11}],"quests":[68132]},"next":[68134]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1019052","obj":{"i":1019052,"n":"Fugetsu","l":2404,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019053","obj":{"i":1019053,"n":"Unryu","l":2404,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021369","obj":{"i":1021369,"n":"Blanstyr","l":2404,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021370","obj":{"i":1021370,"n":"Sunny Stallkeeper","l":2404,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021371","obj":{"i":1021371,"n":"Sekiseigumi Blade","l":2404,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021372","obj":{"i":1021372,"n":"Gyosei","l":2404,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021374","obj":{"i":1021374,"n":"Blanstyr","l":2404,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"19561","obj":{"i":19561,"n":"Doman Steel Pliers","l":260,"c":35262,"t":17,"p":37065}},{"type":"item","id":"5703","obj":{"i":5703,"n":"Craftsman's Competence Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":11,"attr":"Craftsmanship","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"5708","obj":{"i":5708,"n":"Craftsman's Cunning Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"CP","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"5713","obj":{"i":5713,"n":"Craftsman's Command Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":7,"attr":"Control","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"17897","obj":{"i":17897,"n":"Somen Materials","l":285,"c":20801,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"17898","obj":{"i":17898,"n":"Tournament Somen","l":285,"c":25916,"t":63}},{"type":"quest","id":"68132","obj":{"i":68132,"n":"Forging with Scales","g":138,"l":"Kugane","s":650,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68134","obj":{"i":68134,"n":"A Confluence of Style","g":138,"l":"Kugane","s":700,"f":1}}]}
