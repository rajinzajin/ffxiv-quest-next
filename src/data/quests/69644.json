With the city guard's ranks left severely depleted and most of their healers committed to treating the tempered, Raubahn has requested that you assist in efforts to slay the beast.","After arriving in Ala Mhigo, Raubahn explains that a young man was seen transforming into a blasphemy, and that only the swift response of the city guard prevented certain catastrophe. While they succeeded in shepherding the bystanders to safety, they were unable to bring down the creature, which remains at large. With next to no information on the blasphemy's identity or its whereabouts, Raubahn suggests that the two of you investigate reports of a similar incident that occurred just moments ago in Ala Gannha.","On the outskirts of Ala Gannha, you happen upon the aftermath of a battle with several beasts, including two soldiers in need of your ministrations. With no obvious danger in the immediate vicinity, you rush to their aid, while Raubahn scouts the area for any creatures that may have escaped.","The pair of battle-worn soldiers are grateful for your help, but while their physical injuries have been dealt with, even your most potent magicks cannot expunge the memory of the horrific scenes they have witnessed. As agreed, you head to the village to meet with Raubahn.","You find Raubahn in conversation with Raganfrid, the village elder, and Arenvald. As Raganfrid explains, the events surrounding the summoning of Sri Lakshmi and Fordola's intervention had a profound effect on him, and after much soul-searching, he formed the Silver Griffins, of which Arenvald is now a member. Their objective is to oversee the reintegration of returning Ala Mhigan refugees and other groups that remain on the fringes of society, such as those branded as traitors for siding with the Garlean Empire during the occupation. However, the surviving relatives of the Crania Lupi have refused all attempts to assist them, and it is believed that the people who transformed into beasts belonged to this selfsame group. With despair being the driving force behind the metamorphosis, Raganfrid and Arenvald have vowed to address the root causes and thereby avert any further tragedies, and upon hearing this, Raubahn pledges his full support for the Silver Griffins. For the time being, he bids that you return to the city to discuss a plan of action.","Over the course of his troubled life, Raubahn has felt despair time and time again, and memories of the bloody banquet still haunt him to this day. As such, he understands perhaps better than most the importance of the Silver Griffins and their efforts to unite Ala Mhigo. Although there is little that can be done at present to assist them or those tracking the blasphemy and other beasts, he asks that you await further instructions.<br><br>※The next role quest will be available from the blasphemy hunter upon reaching level 86 in any healer class."],"objectives":["Speak with the blasphemy hunter in the Ala Mhigan Quarter.","Speak with Raubahn outside Ala Gannha.","Tend to the soldiers.","Speak with Raubahn.","Speak with Raubahn in the Ala Mhigan Quarter."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALAMHIGOMILITARYATTACHE","text":"If you are ready to lend us your aid, I'll apprise you of the situation."},{"name":"ALAMHIGOMILITARYATTACHE","text":"We've received reports of a creature believed to be a blasphemy stalking the streets of Ala Mhigo.

Aye, your presence alone will be of great comfort to the troops. I'm sure."},{"name":"ALAMHIGOMILITARYATTACHE","text":"As time is of the essence, I ask that you make your way to the Ala Mhigan Quarter and report for duty.

We must find it, and soon, for as long as it remains at large, every man, woman, and child is at risk."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"As was the case in Thavnair, the blasphemy's very existence seems to spur the creation of lesser beasts. The longer it is allowed to roam free, the more tragedy our people will suffer."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Are you certain it's a blasphemy?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Did anyone see the change take place?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Aye, there were several eyewitnesses who gave the same account. A man walking through the Ala Mhigan Quarter fell to his knees all of a sudden, and a moment later transformed into the monstrosity we now pursue."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"But beyond the fact he was a young Highlander, we know next to nothing about him. Even the descriptions of his appearance are too vague to help identify the lad, and we've no clues as to his name or background."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"For all we know he might not have even been born in Ala Mhigo─might've been the son of refugees come to visit. There are other possibilities we're investigating, though..."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"That said, I doubt his circumstances are unique. Blasphemies and beasts are born when men are overcome by despair, and whatever drove him to turn likely could've done the same to another."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Therefore, if we are to prevent future tragedies, it is imperative that we identify and address the underlying cause. Until we do, we'll have no choice but to deal with the afflicted the only way we know how: by granting them a quick death."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"For now, I would have you join the hunt and keep my men from falling prey to these creatures. Are you up to it?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"You have my thanks."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"And as chance would have it, we've just received word that a number of beasts were spotted on the outskirts of Ala Gannha."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"The troops stationed there have already put them down, but were wounded in the process. First and foremost, they need medical attention, and that's where you come in. I'll meet you there."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Although the soldiers were able to lead the beasts away from the village and cull the lot of them, victory did not come easily."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"It's times like these that our lack of healers is most sorely felt. I daresay they've yet to receive any treatment at all.

And yet, here you are."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"For treating the wounds of those soldiers, you have my thanks─and theirs too, no doubt. It seems they were indeed successful in slaying all the beasts, if my search is any indication, but we must remain vigilant."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I've also spoken with several people who witnessed the moment of the transformation, though the ordeal has understandably left them rather shaken."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I hear you've been through a fair few ordeals yourself, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"As for me, I've been kept busy with this and that, like getting the hang of this wheelchair. Obviously, it has its limitations, but it gets me where I need to go."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I've been working with this new organization as well, which is what brought me here. But no sooner had I arrived than those locals turned..."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Raganfrid, I heard you were there when it happened. What can you tell us?"},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"The ones who underwent the change...are the very people we were trying to help."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"Perhaps I should explain from the beginning."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"The meeting Lyse held in the Royal Palace marked a turning point for all of Gyr Abania. It spurred us to open a dialogue with peoples and communities we otherwise would've shunned. But there're still so many problems to be addressed, and countless souls struggling to build new lives for themselves."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"I decided to form a volunteer group─the Silver Griffins. Our main concern is the welfare of Ala Mhigans who sided with the Empire─for whatever reason─and helping them find their place in society. In particular, the surviving families of the Crania Lupi."},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"But I thought you despised the Skulls!"},{"name":"A3","text":"You've changed your tune."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"Make no mistake─I've not forgiven them. I don't have that in me, and I doubt I ever will. But the memory of that day in the palace, of Fordola asking to be locked up again after saving us all...it stayed with me."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"Got me to thinking about why she and the other youths would commit such atrocities. Why they'd swear to serve the Empire. And the answer was simple: because they'd seen what we'd seen and suffered much the same."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"In a hell where all were condemned, they chose to betray one brother to save another. That's how the Garleans win─not by breaking you, but by making you break yourself. By making that choice the <span class=\"emphasis\">right</span> one for a man at the end of his tether."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"Healing only begins with liberation─and some scars never will regardless. Those who've returned from foreign lands may have difficulty carving out a living here, but the ones who'd pledged allegiance to Garlemald..."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"This is not the Ala Mhigo we dreamed of. But after twenty years of misery, I'll not see it all thrown away because we can't come to terms with the past. That's why I formed the Silver Griffins. To see that no one is cast aside."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"It's a cause I support, and it's what brought me here today. I've been acting as a mediator."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"Aye, and in the short time he's been with us, he's proven himself a natural. But despite our early successes, the families of the Skulls continue to refuse our help."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I think I see where this is leading. They're the ones who turned, yes?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"It comes as no surprise. Their kin tormented and murdered fellow Ala Mhigans. Anyone with a conscience would feel shame and guilt, and for some, it might be too much to bear."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Hmm... I think I might know why they're turning us away. It's a sensitive matter, though, so let's go somewhere we won't be overheard."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"It's about one of the men who turned. I saw his memories."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"With the Echo... I'll not pretend I understand it, but tell us what you learned."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I only caught a glimpse, but that was enough..."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"It was during the occupation. A man raising his son. Only the two of them, but they were a family. To keep his boy clothed and fed, he chose to side with the Empire. He knew what others would say, but he did it anyway."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"And so he was branded a traitor. Every day, his son listened to the jeering, the insults, but there was nothing he could do. When he came of age, he joined the Skulls in the hope it would make life easier for his father. He never dared to question his orders, no matter how depraved."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"He died in the revolution, but not before killing his own countrymen. His father wept not for the betrayer and murderer, but for the man he could've been. He blamed it all on himself, right up until the change took him."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I can only pray he and his boy have finally found the peace they were denied in life. Alas, theirs is an all-too-familiar tale. They cannot forgive themselves, nor can they see how anyone else could."},{"name":"RAGANFRID","text":"The sins of their kin weigh heavy on them. They think themselves undeserving of our compassion."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"If they carry on like that, they'll turn into beasts. We've got to help them before it's too late."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Growing up half-Garlean in Ala Mhigo, I know how it feels to be shunned and hated. To hate myself."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"But so long as we give ourselves and others a chance, we can change for the better. And while I might not be as clever or eloquent as someone like Alphinaud, I <span class=\"emphasis\">know</span> I can make a difference."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Aye, I might not be quite the swordsman I used to be, but I'm still a fighter at heart. And I owe it to A'aba and Aulie to make the most of this life so long as I've got it."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"We Silver Griffins will give our all to see that no more beasts or blasphemies ravage Gyr Abania again. So, Commander Aldynn, do we have your approval to continue our work?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Of course. There's no enemy more formidable than despair, and I'd be a fool to refuse your help."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"That even a single one of our people has succumbed to this transformation is proof of our failure to protect them."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Therefore, I pledge the Silver Griffins my unconditional support. Together, we will prevail."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Now that we have <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> on hand to aid the troops, I believe we are ready to face any beasts we encounter."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Though I fear it is only a matter of time before others appear, I ask that you lend the Silver Griffins your assistance in the meantime."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Very good. For now, let's return to the city."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Those who harbor guilt do so not because they are weak of heart, but because they have failed to meet the demands they make of themselves."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"'Twas the same for me when I believed that my failures had led to the sultana's assassination. The despair and self-loathing were...indescribable."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I was fortunate that you and the other Scions came to my rescue. That I had friends who convinced me I was more than the sum of my worst mistakes."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Now we must do the same for the people of Ala Mhigo. We must help them to heal and find the strength to...if not forgive, then come to terms with who we were, so that we can look to who we can be. Who we should aspire to be."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"This is precisely why the work of the Silver Griffins is so vital. Though our problems are not new, the emergence of this deadly phenomenon means we cannot afford to delay addressing them any longer. And we will be better for it, ultimately."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Once we've decided a course of action, you'll be the first to know. Until then, may Rhalgr watch over and keep you."},{"name":"LIVERATIONARMY","text":"With you on our side, those beasts are no match for us!"}],"reward":{"gil":1000},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":85,"id":187}],"quests":[69954]},"next":[69645]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1039411","obj":{"i":1039411,"n":"Ala Mhigan Delegate","l":3707,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1039410","obj":{"i":1039410,"n":"Raubahn","l":2408,"q":5}},{"type":"quest","id":"69954","obj":{"i":69954,"n":"At World's End","g":11,"l":"Radz-at-Han","s":572}},{"type":"quest","id":"69645","obj":{"i":69645,"n":"The Butcher's Blade","g":185,"l":"The Lochs","s":211,"f":1}}]}
