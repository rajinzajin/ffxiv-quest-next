Wawalago can only assume the river has some connection with the shooting stars' disappearance from La Noscean waters, but he is worried for the beastman's safety in distant lands where his kind rarely venture. He implores you to give chase after Govv to ensure that the spirited Sahagin does not get into trouble. Before that, however, the two of you decide to make for Pike Falls to meet one of your angler acquaintances from Coerthas, whose help Wawalago has beseeched in the business of tracking down the disappearing fish.","The capable cooperator enlisted by Wawalago happens to be none other than Reyna, fisher by day and assassin by night. While her investigation has turned up valid insights into the disappearance of the shooting stars, Govv dismisses her findings as a fabrication, on the basis that shorewalkers like you and Reyna possess only a superficial understanding of matters of the sea. Seeking to give Govv a taste of humility, Reyna proposes a contest to demonstrate the full depths of your angling expertise. Reel in three deep Velodyna carp before Govv does to prove that you are as capable a fisher as he.","You easily win your fishing contest against Govv, who─as an ocean-dweller─is not acclimated to freshwater fishing. With the humbled Sahagin now offering a more receptive ear, Reyna elaborates on her findings, that the Sahagins' so-called shooting stars are likely the same schools of migratory fish that can be found further east, although the actual location of their spawning beds remains unknown. As she seeks further information from fishers in the region, she asks you to relay the news in full to Guildmaster Wawalago.","You relay the details of Reyna's investigations to Wawalago, along with the story of your little contest with Govv, which amuses the old guildmaster greatly. After spending a moment to fawn over Reyna's formidable faculty for fishing─along with her many other alluring assets─Wawalago bids you bide your time until she contacts the guild with any further information.<br><br>※The next fisher quest will be available from Wawalago upon reaching level 65."],"objectives":["Meet with the fishing enthusiast at Pike Falls.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Catch three deep Velodyna carp</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the deep Velodyna carp to Reyna at Pike Falls</span></span>.","Report to Wawalago at Fisherman's Bottom."],"dialogue":[{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Thank goodness you're here! Govv's gone off again! This time to Gyr Abania!"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"We had a rendezvous regarding my research into the disappearance of the schools of scarlet fish when a look of realization swept across his scaly face. He dashed away and I could scarcely ask what was the matter before he shouted one word and dove into the deep waters─of the Velodyna, that is."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"As you know, the Velodyna River rushes rapidly through the ravines of Gyr Abania. While I am not privy to the particulars of his epiphany, he appears determined to cross that dangerous divide."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"A single young Sahagin in lands subjugated under the shackles of Garlemald? I fear for our friend's safety─you must find him before he gets entangled with the Empire."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"The region may have been emancipated from the Empire's control, but that doesn't mean that people won't brandish their battle arms against a brash beastman from beyond the border! You must track him down before he gets into trouble!"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Young Govv's got guts, I'll give him that, and it may take more than one angler to reel him in if he gets rowdy. I've contacted our cohorts in Coerthas, and they've consented to send an apt acquaintance to accompany you."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"We've preemptively planned a powwow at Pike Falls. Now fly, friend, and fetch Govv back before he finds himself in a frying pan─figurative or otherwise!"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"I have it on good authority that our angler acquaintance will be arriving in Gyr Abania anon. Pray push on to Pike Falls and pursue Govv before he gets himself tangled up in terrific trouble!"},{"name":"GOVV","text":"You would dare gainsssay the judgment of a Sssahagin in sssuch matters!?"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Well, well! If it isn't <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, angler extraordinaire! How fare you these days? Ansaulme mentioned that you were in need of a deft hand, and as he's tangled up as usual in his struggle for succession, I took it upon myself to accompany you on this little escapade."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Ah, yes─the Sahagin fellow. We just made each other's acquaintance. I saw a large shadow swimming beneath the surface of the Velodyna and when I cast my line, I found him on the other end of it. I was rather surprised to see a beastman so far from home, and what's more one that took the bait. Primal instincts, I suppose."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"'Twould seem he got it in his head that this river is polluted with ceruleum runoff. He's been swimming to and fro for the gods know how long trying to find the source."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Like as not he's right about the pollution─there's no shortage of imperial structures in these parts, after all. But as I've been trying to tell him, I'm all but certain it's entirely unrelated to the disappearance of his beloved shooting stars. For you see─"},{"name":"GOVV","text":"Pshhh! What could the finless know of the riversss and ssseas! There is only one shorewalker I know with the authority to ssspeak of such matters, and his name is Wawalago!"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Stubborn little bugger, isn't he? He won't listen to a word I say! I've tried to explain to him countless times that me and my fellow fishing enthusiasts are every bit Wawalago's equal when it comes to knowledge of the waters, but to no avail."},{"name":"GOVV","text":"Pshhh! The day that a Sahagin heeds the counsssel of a shorewalker on sssuch matters is the day the ssseas dry up!"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Is that so? Then we'll just have to prove here and now that we're worth our salt. To that end, I would propose a contest! As you may know, the deep Velodyna carp inhabit these waters. If we can reel in three before you can spear the same number, you'll agree that our angling acumen is the equal of your own. Do we have a deal?"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"...Well, he certainly took the bait easily enough. All right, I'm counting on you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─go catch us three big ones!"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Hm? You thought <span class=\"emphasis\">I'd</span> be doing the fishing? Perish the thought! Going up against the spearfishing of a Sahagin isn't something I like my chances with. You're far more capable than I."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Don't worry, though. If I'm right, our friend is likely to resort to the same methods he uses in saltwater fishing, as that's all he knows. But <span class=\"emphasis\">we</span> both know that the appropriate angling techniques differ from river to river and sea to sea. Use this to your advantage, and godsspeed!"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"As I expected, Govv is having difficulty adapting to freshwater fishing. Even the water itself seems to be irritating his skin. Still, we mustn't underestimate him─hurry and catch those carp!"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Fine work, as always! You never cease to amaze with how quickly you assess the swimming patterns of your prey, even in unfamiliar waters. Let's call Govv back and settle this once and for all."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Well, would you look at this. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> cast, hooked, and reeled in three carp before you even set your sights on a single one. How does it feel to lose to a land-dweller, Govv?"},{"name":"GOVV","text":"Pshhh... I did not expect fishing in fresh waters to be ssso arduousss. For a shhhorewalker like you to outfish a Sahagin─there are no wordsss to expresss my shame..."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Maybe now you've realized there's some worth to what we have to say. Now, shall we return to the topic of the shooting stars?"},{"name":"GOVV","text":"Pshhh. Capable fishermen you may be, but I have already found my anssswer. The shooting ssstars have disappeared because this river has been sssullied by the ceruleum ssspilling out into its waters."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"And if you would let me finish a sentence for just once, I would tell you this isn't so. Why, your prized fish aren't even native to this river! I've discovered beyond a shadow of a doubt that they hail from further to the east!"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"You see, I came to these parts for business. As <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> knows, my true profession is to ensure that my clients' enemies, ah, sleep with the fish. In my spare time, I took a liking to reeling in those fish. Needless to say, I often have occasion to chat with the locals about their favorite fishing spots."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"So I asked around based upon information relayed to me by Wawalago, pressing anglers from Eastern lands on the whereabouts of fish resembling the shooting stars' description."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"I was able to gather that there are indeed massive schools of bright scarlet fish measuring sixty ilms in length swimming in the waters near the isle of Thavnair in the Near East. And so I─"},{"name":"GOVV","text":"Pshhh! Sssixty ilms!? Those are no shooting ssstars! The fish that my clutch so cherished dwarf even you in sssize, shorewalker!"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Let me finish for once, would you? Furthermore, in East Othard, I found fish of the selfsame appearance as those in Thavnair. Red as blood, but this time a mere <span class=\"emphasis\">twenty</span> ilms in length."},{"name":"GOVV","text":"P...pshhh!? It all makesss sssense now! The shooting ssstars my clutch saw were fully grown! They begin life in the Far East as ssslight hatchlings, gradually growing to gargantuan sssize as they journey to the wessst!"},{"name":"REYNA","text":"That's what I've been trying to tell you from the start! If the numbers that embark on that rite of passage have dwindled to all but nothing, it stands to reason that whatever happened, happened in the vicinity of their spawning beds."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"That said, we still have a lot of ground─and water─to cover before we can fully ascertain just where their nursery is located. While the fishers of the east have seen fish fitting the description of the shooting stars, they were no more knowledgeable about where those fish originate from than we are."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"Thankfully, I've already managed to establish good rapport with the anglers in these parts. Would you be so kind as to return to La Noscea to give Master Wawalago a report at length while I ask about in search for further clues? I will be in touch as soon as I can find a lead to go on."},{"name":"REYNA","text":"And you there! I do hope you've learned your lesson about underestimating the talents of shorewalkers. Try to avoid jumping to conclusions next time we meet, won't you?"},{"name":"GOVV","text":"Pshhh... Loath as I am to admit it, she is right. Forgive me for my arrogance, shhhorewalker. You can assure Massster Wawalago that you will have my ear in the future. I thank you for your aid."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Hoho! It sounds like you and this Reyna bird battered and buried Govv's bravado! I'd expect nothing less from one of the most promising piscators Eorzea has to offer!"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"That Reyna sounds like quite the lass. And nothing gets the heart beating faster than a bonny baitcaster with a basket of bream, eh?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Er...if you say so."},{"name":"A1","text":"If you're keen on women in waders..."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Hoho! A <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> after my own heart! A shame this Reyna doesn't frequent these parts more often─I could provide her with pointers on perfecting her fishing posture. Yes, just like so..."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Ha! You and I both know that all <span class=\"emphasis\">real</span> women wear waders! ...Although I'd not mind if she removed those modest spectacles you speak of so I could see more of her fetching face. Mm-hmm!"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"...Don't give me that grimace! Old Wawalago may be beyond his courting years, but like any La Noscean wine, my appeal is only augmented with age!"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Anyroad, so you say our lovely lady will drop us a line by linkpearl when she has a lead for us? Superb! I'll practice my powers of passionate persuasion in the meantime. Why don't you hone your casting hand at one of your favorite fishing holes in the meanwhile?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In testing new waters as a fisher, you have learned “Mooch II”!"}],"reward":{"gil":2277,"action":268,"items":[{"id":19516},{"num":99,"id":20613},{"id":19627,"one":1},{"id":19628,"one":1},{"id":19629,"one":1},{"id":19630,"one":1},{"num":5,"id":5825,"one":1}],"xp":1725300},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":63,"id":19}],"quests":[68431]},"next":[68433]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000856","obj":{"i":1000856,"n":"Wawalago","l":29,"q":14,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021396","obj":{"i":1021396,"n":"Reyna","l":2406,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021397","obj":{"i":1021397,"n":"Govv","l":2406,"q":1}},{"type":"action","id":"268","obj":{"i":268,"n":"Mooch II","c":1117,"j":18,"t":6,"l":63}},{"type":"item","id":"19516","obj":{"i":19516,"n":"Muudhorn Fishing Rod","l":190,"c":38224,"t":32,"p":27086}},{"type":"item","id":"20613","obj":{"i":20613,"n":"Salmon Roe","l":180,"c":27031,"t":33,"p":59}},{"type":"item","id":"19627","obj":{"i":19627,"n":"Gyuki Leather Hat","l":200,"c":41379,"t":34,"p":15681}},{"type":"item","id":"19628","obj":{"i":19628,"n":"Gyuki Leather Jacket","l":200,"c":42575,"t":35,"p":26136}},{"type":"item","id":"19629","obj":{"i":19629,"n":"Gyuki Leather Gloves of Gathering","l":200,"c":44597,"t":37,"p":15681}},{"type":"item","id":"19630","obj":{"i":19630,"n":"Gyuki Leather Chaps","l":200,"c":47344,"t":36,"p":26136}},{"type":"item","id":"5825","obj":{"i":5825,"n":"Allagan Silver Piece","l":25,"c":26001,"t":61}},{"type":"item","id":"17949","obj":{"i":17949,"n":"Deep Velodyna Carp","l":270,"c":29210,"t":47}},{"type":"quest","id":"68431","obj":{"i":68431,"n":"Whither Wawalago Wanders","g":146,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":601,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68433","obj":{"i":68433,"n":"Search for the Spawning Grounds","g":146,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":650,"f":1}}]}
