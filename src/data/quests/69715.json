You truly <span class=\"emphasis\">are</span> one of a kind!"},{"name":"NORTHOTA","text":"Some would call you “brave,” some “reckless”...but <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> guess is that you simply do what needs to be done."},{"name":"NORTHOTA","text":"In any case, we certainly have a few hunts that call for cavalier heroics, and you're welcome to them. Frankly, I can't believe I didn't think to offer them to you sooner."},{"name":"NORTHOTA","text":"You'll recognize the term “elite marks,” I'm sure. As ever, ours tend toward the bizarre...but don't take my word for it. Ask J'lakshai."},{"name":"NORTHOTA","text":"J'lakshai will fill you in on the rest─won't you, J'lakshai? I know you're listening..."},{"name":"JLAKSHAI","text":"This has become quite the pattern, eh? One would almost think Northota prefers to leave all of the explaining to me...a conversation for another time, perhaps. You want to know more about the elite marks, yes?"},{"name":"CHRYSIELLE","text":"(-???-)You! You are the gleaner extraordinaire who made their way to the very summit of the heavens, are you not!?

Considering the importance of my work and the snail's pace at which you are fulfilling my requests, it should come as no surprise that I have come to personally insist that they are handled with the utmost urgency."},{"name":"CHRYSIELLE","text":"Now, in order to completely validate my theories and protect them from any further impugnations, I have need of your talents. I require more samples to prove that the moon─and indeed, the stars beyond─are teeming with life!"},{"name":"BASILDERE","text":"Wait just a moment! My research in comparative mythology is on the verge of changing our understanding of life as we know it. Indeed, samples of ancient organisms have never been of greater necessity!"},{"name":"LUBDAHRM","text":"What nonsense! Surely the requests made by various departments of the Studium come first! Our pupils are the lifeblood and future of Sharlayan, and we must needs provide them with hands-on instruction in the classification of specimens from both Thavnair and Garlemald."},{"name":"EDITHE","text":"P-Pardon me, but... We researchers are also in great need of your services. We have a mountain of requests relating to Labyrinthos's fiercer specimens in the queue..."},{"name":"CHRYSIELLE","text":"Labyrinthos? Surely you jest! We have a talented individual here capable of exploring environs unlike any known to man, and you would have <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> go to <span class=\"emphasis\">Labyrinthos</span>? I will not stand for it─not when myriad discoveries await in the field of xenobiology!"},{"name":"JLAKSHAI","text":"Enough! Can't you lot see the bind you're putting <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> in!? <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span> will decide for <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">herself</span><span class=\"alternative\">himself</span></span> what to prioritize, thank you very much!"},{"name":"JLAKSHAI","text":"Rest assured that each and every one of your requests have been accounted for. Now off you go─shoo, shoo!"},{"name":"LUBDAHRM","text":"I do apologize for my...colleagues' behavior. Should you be interested in learning more about our requests, pray find us in the aetheryte plaza."},{"name":"NORTHOTA","text":"Heavens. I'm sure they mean well─after a fashion─but I would consider it a personal favor if they learned to be a bit less demanding. Or perhaps more than a <span class=\"emphasis\">bit</span>..."},{"name":"NORTHOTA","text":"Anyroad, they will doubtless find it in themselves to behave if it means they'll get their precious samples. If you are keen to learn more about our elite marks, don't hesitate to make use of them."},{"name":"NORTHOTA","text":"For our part, we're counting on you, so...best of luck out there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You are now permitted to take bills for elite guildship marks from the guildship hunt board."}],"reward":{"gil":785},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":90,"id":34}],"quests":[69714]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1037060","obj":{"i":1037060,"n":"Northota","l":3706,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1037059","obj":{"i":1037059,"n":"J'lakshai","l":3706,"s":3,"q":3,"t":"Guildship Hunt Vendor","r":1,"a":3827,"c":[11.96,13.3]}},{"type":"quest","id":"69714","obj":{"i":69714,"n":"A Hunt for the Ages","g":119,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":30020,"f":1}}]}
