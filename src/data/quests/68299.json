You elect to present the fat to him and explain your current situation.","After you have finished explaining everything to Iturgen, he bids you head to the northeast. You are unsure as to why he would have you travel in said direction, but it seems he is quite keen that you do. Upon finding what seems to be the area he wished for you to visit, you decide to wait and see if anyone, or anything, else appears.","After waiting a short time you see Gascot meeting a group of Gesi that includes Jebei. They demand that Gascot furnish them with bombs which they plan to use to destroy Reunion. When Gascot declares he has no intention of supplying them with any weapons, the atmosphere turns sour and the Gesi move to attack the merchant.","You intervene in the nick of time, just barely saving Gascot from the Gesi assault. After you have dealt with the attackers, you go to see if your merchant friend is unharmed.","Tamachag joins you to put an end to Jebei's scheme once and for all. Cotota then hands you a vellum and infers she would like you to present it to Gascot. You leave in search of him as you realize he left the area while you were otherwise occupied.","When you eventually locate Gascot, he remarks that he has just finished saying his good-byes to the Au Ra that were so transfixed by his Bomb Dance. You hand him the vellum given to you by Cotota which Gascot immediately recognizes as a sign that he has been granted permission to trade in Reunion. Filled with enthusiasm anew, Gascot declares he will return to his office in Kugane and bring back with him wares that will enrich the marketplace. He bids you farewell and says he looks forward to the day when the two of you are reunited once more in Reunion."],"objectives":["Hand the steppe gedan fat to Iturgen.","Stand watch at the designated location.","Slay the group of Gesi hunters.","Speak with Gascot.","Deliver the slip of Qestiri vellum to Gascot."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GASCOT","text":"Ah, pay no heed to me.

They'll listen to anything we ask of them; you'll have permission to trade in no time."},{"name":"JEBEI","text":"All I ask is that you sell your weapons to us first. All of them. I'm especially interested in the bombs you foreigners make."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"B-Bombs!? Well, I have some, although they're used for mining, not war.

However, your efforts have helped us save Reunion from great harm."},{"name":"TAMACHAG","text":"I will make sure the Gesi khan is informed of events. I imagine he will be keen to see Jebei is punished for his crimes."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"How did things come to this?"},{"name":"TAMACHAG","text":"The Gesi may be the most skilled at hunting, but they are ultimately at the mercy of their weapons. There is a limit to what one can obtain on the Azim Steppe."},{"name":"TAMACHAG","text":"No doubt they have long wondered what they could accomplish were they able to get their hands on weapons from faraway lands."},{"name":"TAMACHAG","text":"Jebei is one of the most radical Gesi I have had the misfortune of meeting. He harbors an intense hatred for the larger tribes such as the Adarkim and the Jhungid."},{"name":"TAMACHAG","text":"His plan was to use foreign tools to demonstrate the Gesi's supposed superiority."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"I-I did not ask for any of this!

This is the very vellum required to trade in Reunion!"},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"But why would Cotota see fit to bestow this honor upon me? My near-bungle almost set Reunion ablaze."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Because you acknowledged your mistake."},{"name":"A2","text":"Because you didn't sell any bombs to Jebei."},{"name":"A2","text":"..."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"Ah, yes. I foolishly thought that my wares would enrich their lives, while knowing nothing of their culture and customs."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"But of course! These bombs are for mining, not mass genocide."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"Haha, nicely done, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Words are naught but lies after all. Their kind actions speak louder than words ever could."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"It's obvious to me now just why they place their faith in actions.

I will return as soon as I am ready."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"This region is so different to anywhere I have been and that is precisely what makes it fascinating. However, there are still countless people out there who have no understanding of its cultureâ”€just like me when I first arrived here."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"What's more, if traders such as myself descend upon Reunion in droves, the Qestir will doubtless struggle to keep them under control. That is why I must return, to give back to this land that has taught me so much."},{"name":"GASCOT","text":"I owe a great debt both to the Qestir and to you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.
