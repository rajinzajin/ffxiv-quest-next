She hands you some handwritten invitations of dubious quality, and asks that you distribute them across Gridania to those in obvious need of the festival's affectionate embrace.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","After a quick jaunt around New and Old Gridania, you finish handing out your surprisingly small pile of ceremony invitations. Astrid waits at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to thank you for your service.","Even as Astrid gushes about the growing number of ceremony participants, you bear witness to an ugly argument between two friends who have recently completed the affinity test. Unable to bear the thought of love's flame sputtering out on this most holy of House Valentione occasions, Astrid begs you chase Lisie towards the Whistling Miller. Meanwhile, she will attempt to persuade Taggy to salvage her friendship before she departs for far-off Ul'dah.","You speak with the distraught Lisie, and she takes great comfort in sharing her feelings with you. Mortified by her outburst, Lisie returns to the amphitheatre to apologize to Astrid.","The two friends have been reunited for the moment, but not entirely convinced by Astrid's suggested course of action. They ask that you participate in the ceremony yourself so that they can observe your performance and gain a better idea of where they went wrong.<br><br>When you are ready, the House Valentione servant will escort you to the venue. At the ceremony's conclusion, you will receive a Valentione's Day chocolate, which Astrid bids you bring to her.","Astrid praises your performance in the ceremony, and assures Lisie and Taggy that they are more than capable of the same degree of patience and consideration. After a brief and open discussion, the two friends realize they were approaching their coming separation with different mindsets, which thus affected their affinity results. Astrid is thrilled to see their friendship forged anew, and showers upon you, her champion of love, all the blessings of House Valentione."],"objectives":["Hand out ceremony invitations in Old Gridania.","Hand out ceremony invitations in New Gridania.","Speak with Astrid at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.","Speak with Lisie near the Whistling Miller.","Speak with Astrid.","Complete the Valentione's Ceremony and show the Valentione's Day chocolate to Astrid."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Do you not feel it in the air, adventurer?

Testing our affinity again will likely give us the same result, or worse..."},{"name":"TAGGY","text":"And I only came back because your plaintive tears would be satisfied with nothing less. I did not agree to another run through that trial."},{"name":"TAGGY","text":"But, perhaps... Perhaps if we could see how others completed the ceremony, we might stand a better chance."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Then I should be happy to serve as an example! Allow me to fetch my sibling, Lisette, and we shall display the pinnacle of sisterly affection!"},{"name":"TAGGY","text":"Uh, whilst we appreciate the offer, I wonder if a performance by the very people who run the ceremony might be a little <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> perfect for us to emulate..."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Oh... I hadn't thought of that..."},{"name":"LISIE","text":"What if we have the adventurer here show us how it's done? You already know our situation, so would you mind helping us out a little more?"},{"name":"LISIE","text":"I doubt it matters who you take─I imagine someone of your kind nature could produce a good result with almost anyone."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"What a fabulous idea! I'm certain if you see how effortlessly <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> navigates the twists and turns of affinity, then you'll soon find yourself yearning to take another turn!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Your quest awaits, my champion of love!

There are no class, job, or level requirements for participation."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In the event that you register for the ceremony alone, your partner will be found via the matching system."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"We shall all be watching you with heart-shaped eyes, and waiting for you to return with your victorious piece of Valentione's Day chocolate!"},{"name":"TAGGY","text":"Show us how it's done, adventurer. Have you chosen a partner yet?"},{"name":"LISIE","text":"The affinity test can be so intimidating. I wonder how they will rate you..."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Welcome back! We were all holding our breath in anticipation of your success! You've brought the chocolate, yes...?"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Thank you, adventurer─such an inspiring performance!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"As I am sure you saw, successful completion of the Valentione's Ceremony hinges upon showing your partner a certain degree of patience and consideration."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"But I refuse to believe such fine friends as you are incapable of such a feat. Nay, 'twas simply that you approached the challenge with two slightly different mindsets."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Thus, I implore you...beseech you...beg you...to give your love one more chance..."},{"name":"LISIE","text":"I think you've the right of it, Astrid, thank you."},{"name":"LISIE","text":"It was my fault, Taggy. I was more concerned with the result than simply enjoying the event itself. I wanted so badly to make our last memory together a good one..."},{"name":"TAGGY","text":"Our last memory...? Ah, <span class=\"emphasis\">that's</span> why you were being so anxious about our every move."},{"name":"TAGGY","text":"It was my fault, too, then─I didn't realize how much this meant to you."},{"name":"TAGGY","text":"But I never thought this would be our final farewell. After all, I can always hop on an airship and come back to visit."},{"name":"LISIE","text":"Oh...I suppose that's true. What a silly goose I've been."},{"name":"LISIE","text":"Will you take another turn with me, then? Just for fun this time?"},{"name":"TAGGY","text":"Of course I will."},{"name":"LISIE","text":"Our thanks, Astrid.
