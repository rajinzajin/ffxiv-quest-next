Deliver the tools to Marques at the Church of Saint Adama Landama.","Upon receiving the tools, Marques immediately sets to work and repairs the horologe, as if by instinct─an act that only serves to unnerve the troubled refugee. Apologizing for the inconvenience, he bids you take the device to Sister Eluned, who is currently tending to the body of its owner outside the church.","Sister Eluned has never before seen an intricate device like the horologe, which is reminiscent of the technological marvels Garlemald is said to possess. The brief association causes her to suspect that the deceased owner may have been a Garlean spy, and she considers informing the Immortal Flames stationed in Camp Drybone. However, Marques's ability to repair the horologe appears to be an even more stunning revelation, one which also bears further investigation."],"objectives":["<span class=\"highlight-yellow\">* This quest has been adjusted.

It concerns this broken horologe which was found in the pocket of a man brought here for burial."},{"name":"MARQUEZ","text":"There is something...familiar about it...but just what I cannot say. Perhaps if I tinker with the device, it will come to me."},{"name":"MARQUEZ","text":"However, I lack the proper tools to do so. I would ask that you journey to Ul'dah in my stead to obtain a bull-point chisel and a pair of needle-nose pincers. If you are willing to do this, please note that, as they are uncommon tools, you may need to visit the Goldsmiths' Guild and browse the markets in order to find them."},{"name":"MEMEDESU","text":"A bull-point chisel? Why, yes, we happen to have a surplus of that particular tool. By all means, take one if you so desire. An odd request, if you don't mind me saying─it has a very limited number of applications..."},{"name":"SYNTGOHT","text":"Welcome, <span class=\"emphasis\">welcome</span>! What might a discerning─ My word, did you say needle-nose pincers? You must be a skilled craftsman indeed! Please, take this pair as a gift. By the by, do you have representation here in the exchange? If not, I would be most interested in discussing a partnership..."},{"name":"MARQUEZ","text":"Have you brought the tools I requested?"},{"name":"MARQUEZ","text":"Hmmm...something occurs to me.

Please give the horologe to Sister Eluned. The man who once owned it is currently in her care, and I think it best that it be returned to him."},{"name":"ELUNED","text":"Good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">evening</span><span class=\"alternative\">morrow</span><span class=\"alternative\">day</span></span> to you, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>.
