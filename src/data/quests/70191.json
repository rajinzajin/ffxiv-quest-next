In the hopes of supplanting their schemes before they can take root, he plans to sponsor a costume cortege. To promote the event, he bids you drink a potion provided by the Alchemists' Guild to transform yourself into a frightful creature fit for the occasion and speak with the townspeople.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You imbibe a curious concoction and transform yourself into a delightfully monstrous creature. Thus transfigured, all that remains is to spread word about Gridania of the costume cortege.","Shock and intrigue are the order of the day as your disguise incites interest in the costume cortege. If the event is to be a success as in previous years, however, yet more people must be made aware of the investigator's event. To that end, you return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to select another potion.","You imbibe another curious concoction, transforming again into a festive-yet-frightful creature. Once more you set forth to tell people of the planned costume cortege.","Gridania is abuzz with talk of the costume cortege, meaning your work in disguise is complete. You go to meet with the Adventurers' Guild investigator near the Leatherworkers' Guild, who will surely be glad to hear of your success.","The Adventurers' Guild investigator is overjoyed to hear so many people are eager to attend the costume cortege, but not for the reasons you suspect. He soon reveals the real investigator has been transformed into a hapless monster, and that he is none other than Papa Gruff, the troublemaking clown. His plans to bring about the Night of Devilry seem to be proceeding apace as he takes his leave of you, but the appearance of a mysterious figure offers you a sliver of hope in the form of a plan.","The Wake doctor means to reveal Papa Gruff's true identity by way of questionable cookies designed to dispel his glamour. To do that, she will disguise you as someone Papa Gruff trusts, allowing you the opportunity to offer him said cookies. After giving it some thought, you settle on the appearance of Mama Gruff.","Through the power of alchemy, you are transformed into Mama Gruff. With questionable cookies in hand, you make for the riverbank, hopeful you can lower Papa Gruff's guard and convince him to take the Wake doctor's bait.<br><br>※Should the transfiguration fade, speak with the Wake doctor to change into Mama Gruff again.","With an impressive display of both cunning and charm, you convince the disguised Papa Gruff to eat one of the Wake doctor's cookies. No sooner does he take a bite than his glamour is dispelled, reverting him to his impish form. Papa Gruff is not deterred by this setback, but the arrival of the Wake doctor gives him pause, as he recognizes her as the fabled Great Gourd. Despite Papa Gruff's mischief making, the Wake doctor bids you allow the festival to continue as planned, promising to discipline the imp and prevent any further disruptions. The Night of Devilry thus averted, the Wake doctor bids you report back to the Adventurers' Guild investigator, and assure him that all will be well.","With Papa Gruff's plans foiled, and a surplus of curative potions on hand, the investigator can see no reason to cancel the costume cortege. He thanks you for your assistance, and bids you partake in the festivities you labored so tirelessly to defend."],"objectives":["Transfigure yourself by drinking one of the alchemical concoctions.","Spread word of the costume cortege to the townspeople.","Transfigure yourself by drinking one of the alchemical concoctions.","Continue to spread word of the costume cortege to the townspeople.","Wait at the designated location.","Speak with the Wake doctor.","Speak with the Wake doctor again.","Speak with the Papa Gruff-esque investigator while transfigured as Mama Gruff.","Report to the Adventurers' Guild investigator."],"dialogue":[{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"My, what a wondrous surprise it is to see you here this fine autumn <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">eve</span><span class=\"alternative\">morn</span><span class=\"alternative\">day</span></span>, my adventurer friend!
