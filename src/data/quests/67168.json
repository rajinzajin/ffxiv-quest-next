Yugiri replies that the 3rd Unit Braves have abandoned Revenant's Toll in the wake of Ilberd's defeat, and that only soldiers loyal to the Crystal Brave commander remain. Upon hearing this, Alphinaud declares his intention to thank these stalwart warriors, and disband the company in person. It is time to return to the Rising Stones.","Alphinaud addresses the assembled Crystal Braves, and expresses his gratitude for their service. When he attempts to dissolve the company, however, Riol and the others pledge their undying support to both him and the Scions, claiming their allegiance lies with the ideals upon which the company was founded, not the company itself. Ask Alphinaud for his thoughts on this heartening turn of events.","Alphinaud is moved to tears by the unshakable support of his comrades─support he feels he does not deserve.
