From some distant and exotic land, yes? I require a fresh perspective for the next step in my research, if you have a few moments to spare."},{"name":"PASSEMERRANT","text":"Do not worry, nothing too complex will be required of you. I am planning an introductory class that will educate younglings on the practical applications of aetheric energy, and I seek opinions on the lesson plan."},{"name":"PASSEMERRANT","text":"With any luck, it shall strike a spark which ignites a lifelong love of learning and curiosity. Considering my lofty goals, I welcome honest feedback, even if it isn't entirely positive. Will you help?"},{"name":"PASSEMERRANT","text":"Thank you, my eager student. Together I daresay we are building the future. Pray visit my colleague in Tranquility. A burly Roegadyn fellow, his imposing frame belies a brilliant mind."},{"name":"PASSEMERRANT","text":"My colleague is even now making preparations in Tranquility. Seek him out to begin the class."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Ah, you must be the help Passemerrant sent word about. Are you ready to begin your education?"},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Firstly, observe the object next to me. No mere rock, it is an experimental apparatus designed to simulate the movement of aether through the environment. Through it I intend to demonstrate how crystals are formed."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Now, the next order of the day is to use this explosive to destroy the device. Do not be afraid─your extremities are safe, I assure you."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Go on, use that explosive to destroy the device. Do not worry─they are so weak that even a child should be safe. Should be."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Very good, very good. Did you enjoy yourself, little one? Now you have your very own crystal. Aether flows all around us─an invisible energy that nourishes all things."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"When a physical object so suffuse with aether is destroyed, it releases the energy contained within it into its surroundings. Some returns to the environment, but some remains in the physical realm."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Thus are crystals formed. In simple terms, they are the physical manifestation of aether, frozen in time. Simple enough to understand, yes?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"I've heard those words before, but never in that order."},{"name":"A1","text":"You've opened my eyes. My hunger for knowledge has been piqued."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Ah...is that so? Any Sharlayan youngling could recite those facts from memory. However, I may not always have the luxury of teaching such cultivated minds, as today has demonstrated."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Yes... We must be more thorough with our explanations. So thorough that even the unlearned would have no trouble understanding them. Thank you for your frank opinion─sometimes an outside point of view can illuminate otherwise unseen faults. "},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"Truly? Why, that is encouraging to hear. Truth be told, I was afraid my explanations would be incomprehensible to those not already academically inclined."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"While crystals themselves are a common sight, the exact principles that govern the process of their creation are still a subject of much debate among my peers."},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"After this little display, I intend to open the floor to discussion amongst the participants. I want them to ask the most fundamental question in all research: why?"},{"name":"BIGSTUDENT","text":"You have given us much to consider. As for the matter of compensation, my colleague is in charge of that. Please return to him to receive it."},{"name":"PASSEMERRANT","text":"Ah, there is my bushy-tailed student! Was the experiment to your liking? Children are ever so fond of explosions."},{"name":"PASSEMERRANT","text":"Your payment? Oh, yes, of course. Besides whatever knowledge you gained today─free of charge, mind you─take this. And of course, you are always welcome to join us after I've revised my lesson plan."}],"reward":{"gil":815,"items":[{"id":35685}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69916]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1039510","obj":{"i":1039510,"n":"Passemerrant","l":3706,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"35685","obj":{"i":35685,"n":"Pewter Ring Coffer (IL 525)","l":1,"c":26567,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"69916","obj":{"i":69916,"n":"Sound the Bell, School's In","g":11,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":534}}]}
