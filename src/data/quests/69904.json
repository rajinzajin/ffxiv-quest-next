{"quest":{"name":"For Thavnair Bound","location":"Old Sharlayan","id":69904,"patch":6.0,"sort":522,"icon":101102,"eventIcon":71201,"issuer":1041250,"target":1038597,"genre":11,"journal":["Thancred is eager to set forth for Thavnair.","Another tower has appeared in Thavnair, and the assistance of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn has been requested. In order to spare you, Thancred, Urianger, and Estinien a time-consuming sea voyage to the distant isle, Krile has secured the aid of the researchers of the Confluence, and thither do you make your way to meet with a woman named Kytte.","Welcoming you excitedly as “test subjects,” Kytte informs you that a new kind of aetheryte has been created that does not require attunement, and that the first pair of prototypes have been installed in Old Sharlayan and Yedlihmad, a port town in Thavnair. Once your preparations are in order, you are to join her at the aetheryte plaza for your journey.","With unsettling nonchalance for what could potentially be a one-way trip into the Lifestream, Kytte sends you and your companions on your way to Thavnair─but not before warning you to expect “a teensy-weensy touch of violent aetherial sickness”...","No sooner do you emerge in the balmy heat of Thavnair than you are taken by a debilitating wave of the promised sickness. Only Estinien, who had been to the island prior and teleported the tried and trusted way, emerges unscathed. Seeing the state of you and the others, he goes off alone to procure drinks for his ailing comrades─much to Thancred's dismay. Though your stomach roils fiercely at the slightest provocation, the others appear to be faring worse, and so it falls to you to find Estinien before his aggressive indifference to concepts like “budgets” and “crippling debt” lead to a costly mistake.<br><br>※In the event that you leave the area and wish to return, speak with Kytte in Old Sharlayan.","By sheer force of will, you manage to reach Estinien just as he is about to be fleeced by a merchant. Yet though you are desperate to warn him as such, you soon realize any words of warning you cry out would be accompanied by your last meal. Instead, you resolve to /deny the deal is fair via a gesture.","Your urgent gesticulations manage to do the trick, alerting Estinien to the merchant's dishonesty. Your comrade agrees to a far more reasonable price for three bottles of amra lassi, which he bids you deliver to Urianger and Thancred.","Urianger receives the lassi with thanks and relief, and you next turn to Thancred to hand him a bottle.","The lassi works wonders, and both Urianger and Thancred are soon back on their feet. Alas, though you succeeded in preventing Estinien from one ill-advised purchase, you could not do so a second time, as he returns with his hair bound in an obscenely overpriced length of cord. Though tragic and certain to invoke Tataru's ire, this incident also serves to reveal a trend of opportunistic pricing, which Urianger believes may be due to a dire state of affairs in Radz–at–Han, and it is decided that you will investigate the matter before moving on to seek out Krile's acquaintance."],"objectives":["Speak with Kytte at the Confluence.","Wait at the aetheryte plaza in Old Sharlayan.","Search for Estinien.","/deny to Estinien that the deal is fair.","Deliver a bottle of special amra lassi to Urianger.","Deliver a bottle of special amra lassi to Thancred."],"dialogue":[{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Though I have read much on the subject of Radz–at–Han, this visit shall be my first.

Had I known earlier, I would have considered more suitable attire."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I have Krile's instructions in hand.

I shall go to the Confluence, and I shall face that which hath long been overdue."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"If it's settled, then let us be off. When we arrive, we should look for a researcher named Kytte."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Well now, this is rather a lot of stern faces... Are my library books overdue again?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Not to our knowledge. We're associates of Krile of the Students of Baldesion. We seek passage to Thavnair, and understand that you can assist us."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Ah, the test subjects! Welcome, welcome!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"...“Test subjects”?"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Oh, you hadn't heard? Well then, allow me to explain."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"So, in order to travel to an aetheryte, you ordinarily need to be attuned to it beforehand."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Otherwise you can't use it as a beacon to seek out while you're a mess of aether hurtling along the Lifestream."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"An inconvenient but incontrovertible limitation of aetheryte teleportation."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"But what if I were to tell you that there's a way to travel to an aetheryte <span class=\"emphasis\">without</span> being attuned to it?"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"A way to teleport instantly to places you've never been!?"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"For long years, we've labored to make such travel possible, that people might move about more freely."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"And we've finally done it! We've created a new kind of aetheryte that doesn't require attunement!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Truly!? That changes everything!"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Well, my language may have been a bit misleading. The user need not attune to these aetherytes, but the aetherytes themselves must have been pre-attuned to each other, thereby facilitating travel between the two points."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"But it just so happens that of our first test pair of aetherytes, one has been installed here in Sharlayan, and the other over in Yedlihmad, a port town in Thavnair!"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"As you may know, our nation has long maintained strong ties with Radz–at–Han. And indeed, we owe much of this breakthrough to the contributions of their alchemists."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"So to sum up, we're to “test” these aetherytes. How fortuitous...for you..."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I should mention that an accident has impaired my ability to channel aether. Will this be a problem?"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Not at all! As a matter of fact, you might say these aetherytes were made for people like your good self. The magicks imbued within will whisk you away without any effort on your part."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"A veritable dream come true. And far be it from me to worry about such things, but do we have permission to make use of your shiny new invention?"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"The only permission required is yours, so assuming you're willing, we're all set!"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"It may come as a surprise, but we actually struggle to find test subjects. Most people seem to have an unreasonable fear of their souls gradually disintegrating as they drift helplessly in the Lifestream─in the statistically unlikely event that something goes awry."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"But it's plain that you aren't most people! Heh heh, Mistress Krile truly knows how to pick 'em!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"If I might change the subject... Are Master Wilfsunn and Mistress Bloewyda not present today?"},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Oh, you didn't hear? They've recently resigned their posts. Their expertise was needed elsewhere."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"A large-scale project helmed by the Forum itself, as I understand, but I'm not privy to the details."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I see..."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Any other questions? No? Then let's get going before you change your minds! Please see to your preparations and head outside to the aetheryte plaza. I'll be along shortly."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"In case you were wondering, the aetheryte still functions like a normal one. It's just been upgraded to allow unattuned travel. I'll see you there shortly."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Given my experience with teleportation, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have reservations, but I will trust in Krile."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Though words unsaid yet weigh heavy on my heart, I shall devote mine all to our task in Thavnair."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"I shall teleport the tried and trusted way. Good luck."},{"name":"KYTTE","text":"Oh, you're back? Forgot something, I take it. Just give the word and I'll have you in Thavnair again before you can say “aether sickness”!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"Travel to Thavnair?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You manage to will yourself to your feet, but given your condition, will you be able to reach Estinien in time...?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Heh, no stopping...our champion... Now, quickly... Find Estinien...before he─ Hurrrk!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"You there, I need three drinks.

My special amra lassi, made with only the finest and freshest ingredients, is famed for calming unruly bellies!"},{"name":"MERCHANT04368","text":"By way of a warm welcome to Thavnair, I'm pleased to offer it to you for the low, low price of nineteen thousand and eight hundred gil! For not one, not two, but <span class=\"emphasis\">three</span> bottles! A bargain amongst bargains!"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Hm..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The price is highroad robbery, and you want to say as much to Estinien, but you realize any words of warning you cry out would be accompanied by your last meal..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You must stand before Estinien and, using gestures, <span class=\"highlight\">deny</span> that the deal is fair."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Nineteen thousand and eight hundred gil... That's a reasonable deal...isn't it?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You must stand before Estinien and, using gestures, <span class=\"highlight\">deny</span> that the deal is fair."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Hm... Perhaps it's a bit expensive? Still, if it's special like he says..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You must stand before Estinien and, using gestures, <span class=\"highlight\">deny</span> that the deal is fair."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Hm? I thought you could barely stand. What do you need to tell me that's so urgent?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"...Wait. I <span class=\"emphasis\">shouldn't</span> buy the lassi. This merchant is <span class=\"emphasis\">swindling</span> me."},{"name":"MERCHANT04368","text":"Uwaaah!"},{"name":"MERCHANT04368","text":"S-Sincerest apologies, sir, but I appear to have my prices confused! It's actually one thousand eight hundred and ninety gil for the three bottles of lassi!"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Hmph. That confusion would've been quite costly. For both of us. Very well, then─your coin."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Here, a bottle for each of you. Take them to the others and get some rest."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"I'll be back after I've explored the town."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"“A teensy-weensy touch,” she says... Not even my hardest night's drinking comes close..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Praise...be to the Twelve... My stomach doth loosen its death grip..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"My heartfelt thanks to thee and Estinien─and to the fine fruits of this land."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Ne'er hath teleportation induced such terrible discomfort... 'Twas torturous in its intensity, and I would sooner swim a score malms..."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"You were...in time? Excellent... You've spared us Tataru's wrath..."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Sweet...sweet release... If you haven't already, you should have yours too."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Right, I'm ready to get on with it. That lassi truly worked wonders."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Back on your feet, I see."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Th-Thy hair..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Aye, I've bound it. 'Tis the most I could do against this heat short of shedding my armor."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"...May I ask where you got the cord for it?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"A local vendor. The man said it's a Thavnairian weave─tough and not easily unraveled."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"...And how much did it cost?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Ninety-four hundred gil─a steal, I was told. 'Tis nothing fancy, but I've always valued function over form."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"That's...incredible. I daresay not even Alphinaud could hold a candle to you."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"It's not uncommon for merchants to set their prices high, but doesn't it seem excessive here?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Are all Hannish merchants so unscrupulous?"},{"name":"A2","text":"I expected the Azure Dragoon to put up more of a fight."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I am inclined to agree with thine assessment. It doth seem excessive─unusually so."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"One mustn't be too quick to paint a diverse people with a single brush. If such doth prove to be commonplace, I would presume it symptomatic of societal instability."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"...On that subject, I shall refrain from making comment. Yet I cannot help but observe that the merchants seem overzealous in their pursuit of profit."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Claiming Thavnair as its dominion, the nation of Radz–at–Han hath long thrived as a hub of commerce."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"In the beginning, there were the Arkasodara, a Matanga tribe indigenous to this island."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Over time, they came to be joined by other races, and through their intermingling a culture rich and distinct did emerge."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"From alchemy to textiles, the products of Hannish culture have come to be celebrated and coveted the world over. A development only aided by the nation's prime location as a waypoint betwixt east and west."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"All of this hath combined to make a trading power of Radz-at-Han, yet such a status cannot be taken for granted. Nay, it must needs be maintained through judicious governance and stringent regulation."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Neither of which I see any evidence, given that merchants at a gateway town are free to fleece hapless travelers and tarnish the reputation of the nation at large."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Just so. That opportunistic pricing is rampant doth suggest that oversight is much weakened...or mayhap that the people have fallen upon hard times."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Whatever the truth may be, 'twould be prudent to ascertain the current state of affairs."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Prudent and practical, aye. We've naught to lose by learning more."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"So, ere we seek out Krile's acquaintance, shall we see what information we can gather here in Yedlihmad?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Excellent. We didn't exactly get off to a flying start, but we'll make up for it."}],"reward":{"gil":1375,"items":[{"num":2,"id":36039}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":142}],"quests":[69894]},"next":[69905]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1041250","obj":{"i":1041250,"n":"Thancred","l":3817,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1038597","obj":{"i":1038597,"n":"Thancred","l":3709,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"36039","obj":{"i":36039,"n":"Amra Lassi","l":525,"c":24454,"t":46}},{"type":"quest","id":"69894","obj":{"i":69894,"n":"Old Sharlayan, New to You","g":11,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":512}},{"type":"quest","id":"69905","obj":{"i":69905,"n":"On Low Tide","g":11,"l":"Thavnair","s":523}}]}
