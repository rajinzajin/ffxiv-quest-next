Although seemingly unable to reveal the exact nature of the trial, the familiar explains that you will once more require the cooperation of Dancing Wolf's neophyte summoners. Y'mhitra contacts the flame captain, and he gladly arranges for the mock battle to take place on Seal Rock. Meet Y'mhitra at the airship landing in Ul'dah.","You arrive in Ul'dah only to learn that Dancing Wolf and his soldiers have come under attack on Seal Rock. A greatly concerned Y'mhitra urges you to inform the elite flyer of this development, and make an immediate departure for the island.","You have rescued Captain Wolf and his soldiers from an ambush sprung by a mysterious and powerful summoner. Regroup with your companions at the airship landing in Ul'dah.","Though it seems impossible, you discover that the enemy who attacked your comrades appears to be Sari─an Allagan master summoner who lived several thousand years ago. Speak with Dancing Wolf at the airship landing in Ul'dah, and discuss this unnerving development.","Dancing Wolf and his summoner squad thank you for their rescue, but the identity and abilities of their attacker remain the source of much confusion. Return to Apkallu Falls and join Y'mhitra as she prepares to question Principia.","After considering the facts at hand, you conclude that the Sari you encountered was most likely a clone of Principia's creator. Whatever the truth of the situation, however, the familiar's most precious summoning wisdom has been sealed behind an arcane lock. Y'mhitra vows to scour Allagan records for clues that will allow you to track this “Sari” down and claim the knowledge you have earned...<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Y'mhitra upon reaching level 68."],"objectives":["Join Y'mhitra at the airship landing in Ul'dah.","Speak with the Elite Flyer.","Speak with Dancing Wolf.","Speak with Y'mhitra in Gridania.","Rescue the summoners!","Defeat the unknown summoner!"],"dialogue":[{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"One last challenge remains.

It must be secret─were you aware of the test's purpose, such knowledge would unfairly affect its outcome."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"What I will tell you, however, is that this trial requires conditions that are akin to an actual battlefield."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"As such, I must ask that you call fellow summoners to your side, and arrange a location where you might join hands against a most-realistic primal threat."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Well, this ought to be welcome news for Captain Wolf. I shall see if his acolytes are available..."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Greetings, this is Y'mhitra, I─ Y'mhitra. ...Of the Sons of Saint Coinach? Aye. I have a favor to ask..."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Well, Captain Wolf was more than eager to accept our request. He even offered to arrange exclusive use of a section of Seal Rock."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"It seems there will be an airship waiting in Ul'dah to fly us to the island.

Your decisive action carried the day!"},{"name":"CRISPIN","text":"That was like to a nightmare. What manner of summoner can command so many egi at once...?"},{"name":"DENISE","text":"I felt Thal's hand on my shoulder for a moment there, but Miss Y'mhitra's magicks brushed it away. Thank you for coming to our rescue!"},{"name":"JAJASAMULALASAMU","text":"That bloke called up an army all by himself, an' I'm pretty sure some of 'em weren't egi. I didn't know that kind o' thing was even possible..."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"You arrived in the nick of time, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Thanks to you, my soldiers survived that ambush, and they'll be fit for duty again after a bit of rest."},{"name":"CRISPIN","text":"Aye, you have our gratitude. If you hadn't plunged into the fray like that, we almost certainly would have perished."},{"name":"JAJASAMULALASAMU","text":"Ye said that bastard was “Master Sari,” didn't ye? A summoner of ancient Allag? Did them mages have some way o' comin' back to life?"},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"Alright, Lieutenant, let's not jump to conclusions!"},{"name":"DENISE","text":"Well, he <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span> wielding summoning magicks unlike aught we've ever seen before. Maybe Prin has some idea..."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"...I'll be sure to ask. Come, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Let us return to Gridania."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"What misfortune that such an incident should occur on the cusp of your final challenge..."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"Y'mhitra surprised me once before with her cunning, but I knew in my gut that that ambush was no part of her agenda─it was too sudden; too brutal. Even worse, we're not even sure of who our foe actually was..."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Well, what was meant to be <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s final trial was certainly testing, to say the least. Tell me, Prin: what makes you so sure that that was Master Sari?"},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"Based upon the evidence at hand, there can be no doubt. The vocal and aetherial signatures were identical to those exhibited by my creator."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"The only aspect that gives me pause is his behavior. Master Sari was never one to offer harm to others with such callous indifference."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Ah, I would say there is a larger inconsistency to consider here, Prin: your creator supposedly died several thousand years ago."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"There <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> one other possibility. The greatest minds of Allag unlocked a science known as “cloning,” by which they could artificially create a replicant of a living being."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"Seal Rock is, after all, a construction of the Allagan Empire. Assuming the individual you battled was indeed a clone of Master Sari, then my senses would recognize no appreciable difference."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"An exact copy of the original person...<br>'Twould explain much, but the very thought of it is horrifying."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"...Oh, and did he not tamper with your enchantments!? Are you truly unharmed?"},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"My faculties are undimmed, but the wisdom I was to impart to <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> has been sealed behind an arcane lock. I can do nothing─only my creator holds the key."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Then your secrets are lost to us! If only <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> had been able to attempt that third challenge!"},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"Attempt? <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> has already passed it."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"Allow me to explain: the third challenge is a test of the summoner's nature. Thus does the trial require the presence of companions and a realistic threat. Master Sari's ambush did, of course, bring an unexpected dimension to proceedings."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"Yet <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> leapt to the aid of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> fellow summoners without hesitation, and braved considerable danger to see that they were safely rescued─selfless acts that more than qualify <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> as a worthy successor."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"I had wondered why power and skill were not sufficient... Sari wished to see his teachings passed on to summoners of noble heart."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"Correct. He could not countenance the idea that such knowledge might be put to evil ends. Now you understand why his display of violence so confused me..."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Aye, and all the more reason to suspect an impostor. But whatever this man's identity may be, we will track him down and make him remove that seal. Your purpose is too important."},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"And I will assist you in any way I can. The Master Sari that made me would not stand to see his memory profaned with such wickedness."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Well said, Prin. For an enchanted stack of ink and parchment, you have an impressively developed moral compass!"},{"name":"PRINCIPIA","text":"I possess neither morals nor a compass─I merely follow my enspelled directions to guide worthy summoners. If I give the impression of such characteristics, then mayhap I am overstepping my bounds as a familiar?"},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"No, no, you're fine, Prin! Forget I mentioned it."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"I will see if I can unearth more detailed records of Master Sari. Mayhap the story of his later life will aid us in unraveling this present mystery..."}],"reward":{"gil":2577,"xp":207900},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":65,"id":28}],"quests":[68162]},"next":[68164]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006756","obj":{"i":1006756,"n":"Y'mhitra","l":53,"q":22}},{"type":"npc","id":"1014038","obj":{"i":1014038,"n":"Elite Flyer","l":40,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1014039","obj":{"i":1014039,"n":"Y'mhitra","l":40,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1014040","obj":{"i":1014040,"n":"Dancing Wolf","l":40,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022776","obj":{"i":1022776,"n":"Crispin","l":40,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022777","obj":{"i":1022777,"n":"Denise","l":40,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022778","obj":{"i":1022778,"n":"Jajasamu","l":40,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023459","obj":{"i":1023459,"n":"Principia","l":53,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023489","obj":{"i":1023489,"n":"Principia","l":40,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023490","obj":{"i":1023490,"n":"Y'mhitra","l":40,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68162","obj":{"i":68162,"n":"Performing for Prin","g":155,"l":"Gridania","s":630,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68164","obj":{"i":68164,"n":"Off the Record","g":155,"l":"Gridania","s":680,"f":1}}]}
