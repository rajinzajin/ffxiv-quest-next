I never thought I'd have the honor to meet a hero of your pedigree, let alone beg for your aid."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"You see, I've got a shipment of supplies to send down to Tapper's Den, and having someone who knows the lay of the land by my side would go a long way to ensure its safe delivery."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"I'd defend it myself, but I have to carry the bloody thing! If you'd be so kind as to escort me, I assure you I'll make it worth your while."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"Well then, I'll be waiting outside the gates of the camp. Come meet me when you're ready, but don't take too long─monsters abound in these parts."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"There you are─I knew you'd have the heart to help a soul in need."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The commissary officer is now accompanying you.

It stretches north as far as the eye can see, unhospitable to even the hardiest of explorers."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"It's a wonder that the Garleans survived at all, let alone went on to form the Empire. Seeing the Magna Glacies with my own eyes, however, I've gained some understanding of their disposition."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"This is only hearsay, but I've been told those masses are formed when ceruleum bursts forth from the earth and comes into contact with the surrounding water, freezing instantly and capturing that moment of violence forevermore."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"The water mixed in it prevents the ceruleum from being set aflame, so we can't use it as fuel without refinement. The amount of ceruleum you get after all that work is barely worth the trouble."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"Pure ceruleum is wrested straight from the earth. That's what those rigs you see off in the distance are doing, or so I've heard."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"Oh, my friends aren't going to believe who's protecting me!

I trust you've finished your heroics? Shall we set forth for Tapper's Den?"},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"Here we are, safe and sound. I couldn't have done it without you, friend!"},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"Now all that's left is to deliver the goods. Let's enter those caves and get some shelter from these freezing winds, eh?"},{"name":"JARECK","text":"That trek couldn't have been an easy one, what with the monsters and the cold and everything else besides. It ain't worth much, but you have my thanks."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"Well, the goods have been safely delivered, but... I'm afraid I have one more task to beg of you."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"Of course, I'd do it myself if I could, but I'm afraid this calls for someone with skills that I lack."},{"name":"BLONDESUPPLYMEMBER04216","text":"You're not obligated to help me again, but seeing as how you're already here, maybe you won't mind hearing me out."}],"reward":{"gil":815,"aetherCurrent":1},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69929]},"next":[69753]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1040898","obj":{"i":1040898,"n":"Commissary Officer","l":3710,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1041122","obj":{"i":1041122,"n":"Commissary Officer","l":3710,"q":2}},{"type":"quest","id":"69929","obj":{"i":69929,"n":"Strange Bedfellows","g":11,"l":"Garlemald","s":547}},{"type":"quest","id":"69753","obj":{"i":69753,"n":"Armored Up","g":123,"l":"Garlemald","s":1530}}]}
