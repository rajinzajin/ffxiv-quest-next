All I did was lend him a little aether, and he hopped up and dashed off down the street. Mama and Papa bought him for me as a special gift─now I've gone and lost him!"},{"name":"TINYMIQOTE","text":"They'll be furious with me for losing the toy I kept asking for, so please...you have to help me find him!"},{"name":"TINYMIQOTE","text":"Okay!

That's why I wanted one for myself!"},{"name":"TINYMIQOTE","text":"I have to learn how to move him around better, though, so that when Moony comes back she can see how hard I've been practicing my magicks!"},{"name":"TINYMIQOTE","text":"This is for you.
