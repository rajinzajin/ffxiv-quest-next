It is for her to think on our master's words and recognize the futility of her course."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Those, at least, are my thoughts upon the matter. Yours may be different. Should you wish to give chase, I will not bar your path."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"...We each have but one life, and it is not to be spent recklessly in pursuit of our goals. I pray she realizes this soon..."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Zenos will fall, but not to a desperate knife in the dark. We will need to plan and prepare, and she has done neither."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"...Did Gosetsu send you to stop me?"},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Then you came of your own free will? I should be surprised if you agreed with my chosen course. No one else did."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"But it is not as fanciful as they would have you believe.

I know what he is capable of, and that in an open confrontation, I will likely die."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"But if I do not─if I succeed, then countless lives will be saved. Doma, Ala Mhigo─everything will change! One life for that world is a price I would pay a thousand times over!"},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"...What? What is it?
