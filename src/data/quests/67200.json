We can coordinate the search for the archbishop from here."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I have no objections. Now that we stand upon Azys Lla, I am struck by the vastness of the isle. We must needs be methodical if we are to find our quarry."},{"name":"CID","text":"Good. Now, unless I'm mistaken, this used to be an airship landing, and a major one at that. From what I know of Allagan design, there should be a terminal nearby that's linked to the isle's operational heart."},{"name":"CID","text":"If we can find such a terminal, we should be able to learn something of the archbishop's whereabouts. Let's split up and look for it."},{"name":"CID","text":"This terminal has long since ceased to function. Search for another."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"It's still active─all of it..."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"Crikey... This place is like something out of my dreams..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Cid is right. We owe it to Ysayle to see the mission through."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"I sense an ominous presence..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Heavy though our hearts may be, we must forge on─in the name of those we have lost."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I daresay this landing could accommodate even a Ragnarok-class vessel... Remarkable."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"What ungodly vessels must the Allagans have built to warrant so vast a landing?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"To think that such a massive structure has been floating above our heads for all these millennia... It beggars belief..."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"The Empire borrowed most of its technology from Allagan relics. If we can find the terminal, I reckon we can operate it."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"This place is an engineer's playground. If I had the time, I'd be going over it with a bleedin' magnifying glass."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Machines are beyond my ken─I shall leave it to the others to find this “terminal.” Of more concern to me are the dragons that I sense nearby."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"This ominous presence... To whom does it belong?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Alas, I have found naught of use."},{"name":"CID","text":"...Nothing? Damn it. There's just this terminal, then, but it doesn't respond to anything I do. Any bright ideas, Wedge?"},{"name":"CID","text":"...Wedge? He was here just a moment ago. Oh, don't tell me he's wandered off..."},{"name":"CID","text":"I'm sorry, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but could you help me search for him? Absent-minded as he is, I worry that he's strayed beyond the landing area, and made friends with the local sentinels."},{"name":"CID","text":"I need you to help me search for Wedge.

Are you all right!?"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"I-I'm fine, Chief. I just tripped, that's all."},{"name":"CID","text":"Fool of a Lalafell! What were you thinking, coming here on your own!? Death by overwork is one thing─death by <span class=\"emphasis\">stupidity</span> quite another!"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"I'm sorry, Chief... B-But I think I've found something!"},{"name":"CID","text":"What is this? The wreck of a sentinel?"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"This is no wreck, Chief!

You have to do what the chief says!"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"Yes, that's it! Good girl!"},{"name":"CID","text":"Ah, here we are... Hmmm, not much of note. It appears someone recently reactivated “Helix,” which is this area."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Reactivated, you say?"},{"name":"CID","text":"By the archbishop, I'd wager. I daresay he woke the place up when he used the Vanu's key."},{"name":"CID","text":"Are there any other people in the facility? If so, where?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Let's see here... On the “Flagship”─that's the central isle─I'm seeing positive readings within the Aetherochemical Research Facility and the Fractal Continuum..."},{"name":"CID","text":"And what have we here? Intruders detected in the Gamma Quadrant, defense system engaged."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Our imperial friends, I suspect. I hope they enjoy the defense system. But what of the archbishop and his cronies?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Hmmm, what might offer an indication? ...Ah! How about this: which area is currently consuming the most energy?"},{"name":"CID","text":"...Somewhere called “Triad Control,” inside the research facility."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And what manner of place is that?"},{"name":"CID","text":"It is, and I quote, “a regulation facility for the 'Warring Triad' test subjects.” And that's all it says. The rest of the information is only accessible to users with consular privileges."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I mislike the sound of this...which leads me to believe that it is indeed the place."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I am inclined to agree with Y'shtola. Whatever it is that the archbishop seeks, it is like to be there."},{"name":"CID","text":"That settles it, then.
