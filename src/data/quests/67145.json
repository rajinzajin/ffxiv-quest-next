Shall we make our way into Dravania, then?"},{"name":"ICEHEART","text":"The chill of the western highlands is unrelenting, and I would sooner be under the sheltering canopy of the Chocobo Forest."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We journey to the homeland of dragons, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

The path to Sohm Al will take us far to the west, beyond the embrace of the forest's branches."},{"name":"ICEHEART","text":"It will be a long and demanding journey. Might I suggest that we take our rest at the village up ahead, and see that we are properly provisioned?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"There is a village here? But I thought these lands the sole domain of dragonkind. Why would anyone choose to live in so perilous a place?"},{"name":"ICEHEART","text":"The wild chocobos. Tailfeather was built by hunters who make their living capturing and selling the beasts. Their leader, Marcechamp, is an acquaintance of mine."},{"name":"ICEHEART","text":"Being a gregarious sort, he will no doubt welcome our arrival. And he will also possess more recent knowledge of the road we seek to travel. I trust there are no objections?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Only to this ceaseless chatter.

Might we stay in Tailfeather awhile, and prepare for the next leg of our journey?"},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"Of course, of course, stay as long as you like! In fact, I wouldn't suggest leavin' the forest at all.

Thank you for the explanation."},{"name":"MARCECHAMP","text":"You're welcome. Now, I know it won't stop Ysayle here, but dragons ain't the only things you'll need to keep an eye out for.
