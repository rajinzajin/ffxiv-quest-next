He hands you a folded letter, and asks that you present it to Szem Djenmai, the Master of Beasts at Temenos Rookery.","After perusing your letter of introduction, Szem Djenmai not only agrees to provide you with an amaro, but also insists upon accompanying you on the first leg of your trip. He bids you gather your gear and head to the Amaro Launch, where one of the younger tamers will attend to you while Szem is saddling the mounts.","Despite obvious doubts as to your skill as a rider, the young tamer nevertheless trusts in Master Djenmai's decision to grant you the use of his amaro. Your journey to Kholusia has begun.","After a blissfully uneventful flight, you alight upon the island. Szem waits patiently nearby as you find your land legs.","According to your guide, it is not the wildlife of Kholusia that should concern you, but its people. Once satisfied that you have heeded his warning regarding the Eulmorans, the Zun promises to tell you something that will aid you in your search for Alphinaud..."],"objectives":["Present the letter of introduction to Szem Djenmai at Temenos Rookery.","Speak with the aspiring amaro tamer.","Speak with Szem Djenmai."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"You will visit Alphinaud in Kholusia, then? Excellent."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"As I mentioned, your destination is an island off the west coast, so you will need a mount capable of making the journey."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Here is a letter of introduction.

Mounts like my grey friend over there are a common sight in these parts."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"But I gather you hail from further afield. More accustomed to chocobos, perchance? I hear there are a few places where they ride little else."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"A chocobo? Do you hail from one of Norvrandt's more isolated settlements, perchance? I hear there are a few places where they ride little else."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"But here in the Crystarium, mounts like that grey fellow there are far more commonly used."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"...Hm. Seeing as you are plainly unaccustomed to riding amaro, I think it best I accompany you on this flight myself."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"Any Zun worthy of the name could do it, of course, but the Exarch sent you to me.

The Crystarium is one among many who resist their heavy-handed authority, and while we are not at war, our relationship with Eulmore is strained at best."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"It may be wise to conceal your ties with the Exarch during your stay here, especially in the vicinity of the city."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"I am glad we understand each other.<br>Now, the Exarch has instructed me to divulge a secret that should make finding your friend a good deal easier.
