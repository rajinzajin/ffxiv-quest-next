He should be waiting near the base of the cliff to the north of the Convictory. Find him and find out what is wrong.","Saintrelmaux assures you that there is nothing wrong with him. The trap, however, does not seem to be working. The more powerful members of the Dravanian Horde seem to be much more cunning and wise. Perhaps there is something about the corpse that gives it away as a trap. Examine it and make sure there is nothing amiss.","The aevis corpse seems fine to you. Tell Saintrelmaux that you could not find anything wrong with it.","With no visible problems with the trap, the only option is to wait patiently for a Dravanian to take the bait.","You have slain the wyvern that was attracted by the dead aevis. Report back to Saintrelmaux.","Inform Dominiac that the plan has succeeded. Saintrelmaux will handle getting the slain beast back to the Convictory.","Dominiac thanks you for all your hard work. He asks you to check and make sure that Saintrelmaux has made it back to the camp safely.","Saintrelmaux has finished hauling the downed dragons back to the Convictory and is about to start examining the wyvern's body for abnormalities. Lend a hand!","Upon checking the wyvern's claws, you discover scales from both a tulihand and a wadjet─no doubt from the creatures you previously slew. Return them to Saintrelmaux.","Upon seeing the tulihand and wadjet scales, Saintrelmaux starts to realize the level of camaraderie among the Horde. Not to be outdone by the Dravanians, he pledges his life to the protection of those he knows and cares about─his friends and the people of Ishgard. Report to Dominiac that all is well.","Dominiac is pleased with the progress of the plan and with Saintrelmaux's newfound purpose. The young soldier's example could serve as a beacon to other lost youths and rally them to Ser Aymeric's cause."],"objectives":["Speak with Saintrelmaux.","Examine the slain aevis.","Speak with Saintrelmaux.","Lie in wait.","Speak with Saintrelmaux.","Speak with Dominiac.","Speak with Saintrelmaux.","Examine the wyvern leg.","Speak with Saintrelmaux.","Report to Dominiac."],"dialogue":[{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"Ah, it is good to see you! The corpse of the aevis you slew is being put into position right now to attract a great dragon for us to slay."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"However, I'm concerned about Saintrelmaux. He seems even more morose than his normal grim self. I want to help him but─perhaps because I'm his commanding officer─he <span class=\"emphasis\">really</span> doesn't want to talk to me about it."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"Do you think you might be able to talk to him for me? The two of you have been through quite a few battles together now. He might be more inclined to share his troubles with you."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"He's to the north of the camp. Preparations for the next step of the plan should all be finished by now, so he'll just be waiting for you there."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"Saintrelmaux will be waiting for you just a short ways to the north of here."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"Well met, friend. As you can see, the aevis's body has been laid out in plain sight, but none of the Horde have shown any interest in the thing."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"Me? Something I want to talk about? No, not really. Though, spending all day keeping vigil over Dravanian corpses leads one to thinking about these creatures more than one might expect."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"All things considered, this aevis was quite a high-ranking creature of the Horde. I've no doubt that whatever comes to collect its body will be quite a mighty dragon indeed. They're wise and intelligent creatures, and they won't be tricked easily."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"I've taken a great deal of care with the preparations. But still no dragon comes. Do you think you might take a look at the aevis for me? Just make sure there's nothing out of the ordinary─something I might have missed."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"Would you take a look at the aevis for me? Just make sure there's nothing wrong with it that I might have missed."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"Hm. Nothing out of the ordinary? Well, if it looks good to you, then I'm satisfied."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"It must just be a matter of time. If it's all the same to you, would you mind waiting with us for the dragon to show itself?"},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"There's nothing left to do now but wait..."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"A wyvern... I'd only ever heard stories about them."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"An ancient creature that once soared effortlessly through the clouds. Most go their whole lives without ever seeing one of these legendary beasts... I should take a minute to check its body before we take it back to camp."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"You go back to the Convictory and report to Dominiac. We'll handle getting the dragons' bodies back to the camp."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"Head back to the Convictory and report to Dominiac. We'll deal with the dragons' bodies."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"That certainly took longer than I expected. Did the plan work? Tell me everything that happened!"},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"A wyvern!? You slew a wyvern!? I have no words to express my gratitude. Thank you for your help!"},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"Saintrelmaux should be back by now. Could you do me one more favor and make sure he's made it here safely?"},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"Saintrelmaux should be back by now. Could you make sure he's made it back to camp safely?"},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"Ah, you've reported back to Dominiac already? We got back just moments ago."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"We were just about to start examining this beast. Would you be so kind as to lend a hand? You may as well start with the leg. It's as good a place as any."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"Could you lend a hand with the examination?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You find a tulihand scale and a wadjet scale in the wyvern's claws."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"You've finished already? Did you find anything interesting?"},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"A scale from the tulihand? And one from the wadjet? Both in the claws of the wyvern?"},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"This mighty creature carried away their bodies, and kept mementos in memory of its fallen comrades?"},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"These creatures know each other? Recognize each other? Mourn for each other? That even <span class=\"emphasis\">Dravanians</span> would show such concern for each other..."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"I grew up depending on my status and nobility. I led such an easy life that, when my house fell─when I was betrayed by those I trusted─I blamed everyone around me."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"In retrospect, I should have blamed myself. It's my own fault that I was abandoned by both those I served and those who served me."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"(-Saintrelmaux's Retainer-)Saintrelmaux, why do you think I am still here, serving you?"},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"(-Saintrelmaux's Retainer-)Your house may well have been disgraced, but I serve you─not your house. I fully intend to remain your loyal servant to the end."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"I think, if anything, you are <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> loyal. But I still greatly appreciate it."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"I came here looking for a place to die. Perhaps now is a good time to let the old, bitter me die─to let go of all that hatred."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"From now on, I want to live, not for social status or nobility, but to protect those close to me. To protect my friends. To protect the people of Ishgard!"},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"I shall travel to my family's graves, and swear an oath to protect those I care about. I've not yet been to their graves. I've been too ashamed to show my face. But if even the Dravanians can mourn their dead properly, then I think I should find it within myself to do the same."},{"name":"SAINTRELMAUX","text":"I owe you an immense debt of gratitude. I can only hope that next time we meet, I will have grown as a man such that I might inspire you, as you have inspired me."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"You seem pleased with yourself. Did something happen with Saintrelmaux?"},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"I see. Thank you. I, too, owe you my thanks."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"Thank you, not just for the inspiration you provided Saintrelmaux, but for the invaluable assistance you provided in helping my plan come to fruition. If things continue to progress this well, we may catch ourselves a dragon yet greater still than this wyvern."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"A great accomplishment like that would serve Ser Aymeric's cause well. And that's not all."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"Young though he may be, Saintrelmaux has achieved truly courageous feats of combat and has opened a world of opportunity for himself. When other young men hear of his exploits, they'll be eager to rally to Aymeric's cause and fight under his banner."},{"name":"DOMINIAC","text":"If anything, I'd like nothing more than to recruit <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>. But somehow I get the feeling that you're not the kind to settle down in one place─much less somewhere as remote and isolated as the Convictory. Still, I hope that you'll continue to lend us your strength from time to time."}],"reward":{"gil":610,"xp":25200},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":51,"id":34}],"questsType":"all","quests":[67142,67302]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1013710","obj":{"i":1013710,"n":"Dominiac","l":2200,"q":6}},{"type":"npc","id":"1014142","obj":{"i":1014142,"n":"Saintrelmaux","l":2200,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1014144","obj":{"i":1014144,"n":"Saintrelmaux","l":2200,"q":2}},{"type":"quest","id":"67142","obj":{"i":67142,"n":"Sounding Out the Amphitheatre","g":3,"l":"Coerthas Western Highlands","s":27}},{"type":"quest","id":"67302","obj":{"i":67302,"n":"Advanced Dragonslaying","g":94,"l":"Coerthas Western Highlands","s":5113}}]}
