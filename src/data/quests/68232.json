He was unable to identify his assailant, but many suspect it might be the doing of a coralshell. Around this time they begin laying eggs and can be very aggressive."},{"name":"UROKUZU","text":"I, however, believe it to be something far more sinister than that. The individual I speak of is Tamamizu's most gifted fighter. A mere coralshell would not be able to catch him unawares."},{"name":"UROKUZU","text":"The incident took place on the northern shores of the Isle of Bekko. Please, might you go there and investigate what could have been behind this?"},{"name":"UROKUZU","text":"Do be careful.

While we are by no means on friendly terms, they have never attempted to murder one of our own until now."},{"name":"UROKUZU","text":"...Then again, perhaps they were not aiming to take his life but were simply looking to steal the ancient rod he was using at the time. It is, after all, one of our most valuable treasures."},{"name":"UROKUZU","text":"I must warn the others to take extra precautions when leaving the village with anything that can be considered to be of great worth.
