I would appreciate your help, should you have the time."},{"name":"FANATIC02790","text":"However, I would prefer to discuss it somewhere free from prying eyes. Meet me in front of the Dusk Throne."},{"name":"FANATIC02790","text":"Thank you for coming. I wish to go to meet with Nhaama. But the road to her is fraught with peril. As such, I need someone to protect me."},{"name":"FANATIC02790","text":"It was only a few weeks ago that both my mother and father were taken from me by the heartless Oronir."},{"name":"FANATIC02790","text":"Their deaths made me realize that I must commune with the Dusk Mother. I shall pray that she strike down those who pretend they are the children of Azim, and that she continue to nurture the Dotharl."},{"name":"FANATIC02790","text":"Nhaama resides in the House of the Crooked Coin to the north.

But, why?"},{"name":"MARAL","text":"So she has gone to be one with the Dusk Mother. I have no doubt it is what she wanted, but that knowledge does naught to alleviate the pain in my heart."},{"name":"MARAL","text":"The House contains a crystalâ”€a sliver of Nhaama's essence. Those who wish to rejoin with the Dusk Mother throw themselves down into the cavern there. This breaks the cycle of reincarnation."},{"name":"MARAL","text":"The Dusk Mother has always been at the center of my friend's life. The same was true of her previous incarnations."},{"name":"MARAL","text":"To think, if she had been killed together with her family, her spirit could have moved into the child my sister is about to birth..."},{"name":"MARAL","text":"Forget what I just said. I did not mean it. We should take solace in the knowledge that she is finally at peace."},{"name":"MARAL","text":"The envelope her letter came in also contained what seems to be your compensation for helping her.
