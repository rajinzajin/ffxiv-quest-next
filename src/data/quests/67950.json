Make your way to the Conjurers' Guild in Gridania, and present yourself to Brother E–Sumi–Yan.","The guildmaster is enthusiastic to receive your proffered aid, and soon explains why: the elementals' disquiet appears to stem from East End, the war-torn region lying on the border between Gridania and Gyr Abania, and he deems a journey into this unstable area best attempted with you at his side. Make your preparations, and meet Brother E–Sumi–Yan at Nine Ivies in the East Shroud.","Upon arriving in Nine Ivies, E–Sumi–Yan confirms that the source of the disturbance is indeed originating from the direction of East End. His questing senses also reveal a guilty-looking Sylphie, who claims to be unable to ignore the keening plight of the forest spirits. The guildmaster reluctantly allows her to join your party, and the three of you make for Castrum Oriens to continue the investigation...<br><br>※The serpent officer stationed at Amarissaix's Spire in the East Shroud will grant you passage to Castrum Oriens.","You rejoin Brother E–Sumi–Yan, and he suggests splitting up to search for the exact location of the disturbance. Head towards the southwest, and survey the area for anything unusual.","You peer about for a sign of what might be upsetting the elementals, and are surprised to spot a child and her protective mother in the supposedly treacherous lands of East End. Aside from this unexpected encounter, however, you are unable to pinpoint the origin of the disturbance. Return to Castrum Oriens and aid the guildmaster in learning more about the area's inhabitants.","Though the matter is far from resolved, Brother E–Sumi–Yan feels he has already been absent too long from Stillglade Fane. Sylphie then offers to remain in Castrum Oriens, and take up the investigation in his place. The guildmaster acquiesces...on the condition that you agree to supervise her efforts. The future promises to be full of challenges, and you will need to continue your studies if you are to be sure of meeting them.<br><br>※The next white mage quest will be available from Sylphie upon reaching level 63."],"objectives":["Speak with E-Sumi-Yan at the Conjurers' Guild.","Speak with E-Sumi-Yan at Camp Nine Ivies.","Speak with E-Sumi-Yan at Castrum Oriens.","Survey the area to the southwest.","Speak with E-Sumi-Yan at Castrum Oriens."],"dialogue":[{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"I thought you might come, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> of the white.

Glad I am that she did."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"As I am sure you have felt yourself, the elementals are in an uproar. And whilst I would soon depart on my investigation, the forest's disquiet appears to stem from lands that cannot be approached in blind haste."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"I speak of East End, at the very edge of the Twelveswood. Long has this border betwixt Gyr Abania and our nation been held by the forces of the Garlean Empire."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"The Alliance did recently take control of Baelsar's Wall, and thus commands the fortifications in East End, but the stability of the region is yet tenuous at best."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"'Twould be a far more certain venture were I to have you at my side. Are you willing to make the journey?"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Then we need delay no longer. Let us make our preparations, and begin our trek from Camp Nine Ivies."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Pray make ready, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I shall await your arrival at Camp Nine Ivies."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Thank you again for coming, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I arrived some moments earlier and bent my ear to the forest's whispering─although here it might be better described as a “keening.” There is no doubt that we are nearer to the source."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"...And I am also certain that we are not alone."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Come out! You cannot hide your presence from me."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Oh, Sylphie..."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"I should've known you would sense me..."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Your early failures to attend lessons gave me ample practice at finding those who did not wish to be found. Now, am I to assume that you, too, have been brought here by the plight of the elementals?"},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"Yes, Guildmaster. I'm sorry for leaving without permission, but I just <span class=\"emphasis\">had</span> to know what was causing all this commotion!"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"You will return to Stillglade Fane, and leave this investigation to <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and me. Such is the danger inherent in this task that even I felt compelled to request assistance."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"Please, Guildmaster, let me help! Never have I heard the voices of the elementals so clearly before...<br>They want to tell me something, I just know it!"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"And it is that very “something” that I, as guildmaster, am charged to discover. You, as an acolyte, are neglecting your duties back at the guild."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"But how can I ignore their pleas? I feel their unease like...like chains tightening around my chest! Isn't it my duty as a conjurer to protect the forest!?"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"...Their unease? You truly sensed this emotion from the river of their susurrations? And you truly wish to return the forest to tranquility?"},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"I swear by the Matron Herself. I only want to put into practice the lessons you have taught me."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"A noble purpose. But if I were to permit this, you must promise to weigh the consequences of your actions <span class=\"emphasis\">before</span> you commit to them. I would not see a repeat of previous incidents..."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"Then...I can come!?"},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"I promise I'll be careful! And I'll be sure to ask for <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s help the moment I need it!"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"See that you do. Now, it is past time we braved the borderlands of Gyr Abania. We can travel as far as Amarissaix's Spire, then a serpent officer will guide us through the ruins of the castrum from there."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In order to continue this quest, you must first undertake the main scenario quest “Beyond the Great Wall.”"},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"Ugh...it's getting worse. &lt;shiver&gt; This is not unease anymore, this is fear..."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"The closer we are to East End, the more certain I am we are moving in the right direction."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"The precise location of the disturbance yet eludes me, however..."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Even from the elementals themselves, I sense only confusion. I fear there is naught for it but to conduct a more conventional search."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"I will head southeast. Sylphie, see what might be found directly south. Southwest is yours, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"I would prefer we stay together, but time is of the essence.

Come here, this instant!"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! What befalls!? I felt a surge of panic coming from this direction."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"Whatever it was, I feel nothing now. Did you see anything?"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"...A child? Out here? By your description the mother may be a hunter, but I am curious as to her choice of hunting ground..."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"...Could it be <span class=\"emphasis\">their</span> fear which has the elementals so upset? In any case, it seems the answer to that has run off into the brush."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"Let us return to Castrum Oriens for the present, and learn more of East End's inhabitants."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"I didn't think anyone even lived in East End..."},{"name":"OFFICER02414","text":"I'm with the unit occupying Castrum Oriens. You've caught me just as I was delivering our interim report."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"This gentleman is an officer stationed at the castrum. Mayhap he will know more of the mother and child you spotted."},{"name":"OFFICER02414","text":"And you believe these folk were living in the forest? I was under the impression that the East End settlement was empty..."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"We suspect a connection to whatever is disturbing the harmony of the Twelveswood. Might you spare us some few soldiers to investigate the possibility?"},{"name":"OFFICER02414","text":"Ordinarily I would be overjoyed to aid in your investigation, but I fear our duties on the border demand our full attention.<br>...My most sincere apologies, Master Padjal."},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"How inconvenient. This matter is far from resolved, yet I have already been overlong in returning to Stillglade Fane."},{"name":"SYLPHIE","text":"Let me handle it, Guildmaster!"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"You would have me entrust this task to an acolyte?

I had only intended to involve you in this initial foray, but might I ask that you see the matter through to its conclusion?"},{"name":"ESUMIYAN","text":"My thanks. I foresee hardships ahead, but also an opportunity for new discoveries.
