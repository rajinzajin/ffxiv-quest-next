Only then do you learn that your quarry is in fact the king and ruler of the faeries, Titania, who defeated a Lightwarden that had threatened Il Mheg, only to be corrupted by the aether that was subsequently released. Though the pixies are convinced that you will perish in the attempt, they readily agree to cooperate─if for no other reason than that it would prove interesting to watch. They duly bestow upon you a white dress, one of four relics required to lift the seal over the castle. If you are to obtain the first of the three remaining items, you will need to set forth for the Untouchable Gate by the lake to request an audience with the slippery Fuath.","Standing before the Untouchable Gate, you call out to the Fuath, but there is no reply. While the party considers other ways to reach out to the creatures, the watery voice of a Fuath rings out. It agrees to give you the shell crown relic, but in exchange you must brave the dangers of their domain, Dohn Mheg, in a show of “thrilling sport.” With no other recourse, you make ready to sally forth into unknown waters.<br><br>※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players.","You fight your way through the Fuath's domain, providing them the sport they desired and earning the shell crown for your trouble.","Before you can depart with your prize, the Fuath live up to their reputation by attempting to claim you for their own, and you are swallowed up by a mighty wave, everything turning black. Fortunately, your ability to breathe underwater saves you, and you awaken in the depths of the lake with Ardbert yelling in your ear. At his urging, you set out to rejoin the others back on dry land.","Your comrades are relieved to see you none the worse for your soaking, and Alisaie presents you with the shell crown by way of reward for your doggedness. At that moment, Sul Uin flutters in with word that armed men are drawing close to Il Mheg─the Eulmoran Army in all likelihood. While the twins return to Lydha Lran with the pixie to assess the situation, you and the others agree to continue your quest to collect the remaining relics."],"objectives":["Investigate the Untouchable Gate.","Enter Dohn Mheg.","Search for Urianger."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"You couldn't have returned at a better time. The pixies had just decided that it would be amusing to have Alisaie and I exchange outfits..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Ahaha, thank the gods you arrived when you did! Any later, and I don't think I would've been able to live it down!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"When you have a moment, be sure to show your appreciation to the twins. They've endured a great deal on our behalf..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I dare not ask what happened in our absence..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Full glad am I to see that our gifts were gratefully accepted. Confident though I was in our choice, there is no accounting for mood."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"So, what is it that you desire? Rusty old coins like you mortals are wont to collect, perhaps?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"We are resolved to vanquish the Lightwarden of this land. To that end, we desire entry to Lyhe Ghiah."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"What a strange thing to wish for! You might as well ask for your death!"},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"But if that is what you want, who are we to argue? Very well, I shall speak with the others."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"You've clearly been busy, Urianger. Would you be so kind as to tell us what we've missed?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...So that was the purpose of the gifts."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Is there anything you can tell us about this Lightwarden?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Aye, my lady. By circumstances most tragic, the Lightwarden of this land..."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"...Is our king and ruler, Titania."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"It was not always so, of course. Our king fought the first Lightwarden that threatened our home, you see. Fought it, and won."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"But all the horrible light that came out went and corrupted them, turning them into a new Lightwarden."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"Now, they're king only in name. Naught remains of the wise and just ruler that used to be. We had no choice but to seal them in the castle."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"The magick for breaking the seal, we divided into four, and wove each into a different relic, to be kept apart until the time was right..."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"And this dress is one of them. It's been in our safekeeping for years and years, but we've decided to entrust it to you."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Are you sure?"},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"Of course. Custom demands it."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"Though you're most certainly going to your deaths, we thought we should at least let you try. That way, we get to watch what happens!"},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"Of course, you can't break the seal unless you have the other relics too."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"The shell crown is with the Fuath, the stone scepter is with the Nu Mou, and the crystal shoes are with the amaro."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"Good luck finding them all!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"The facts thus disclosed confirm mine own understanding. Our quest lieth now before us."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"First, let us hie to the lake, there to claim the shell crown from the Fuath."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"If we call to them before the Untouchable Gate, they will answer."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"What a lot of leafmen..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I was about to say the Fuath couldn't be any more unreasonable than the pixies, but that's just asking for trouble."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"During our sojourns in Il Mheg, we avoided the lake at all costs. Let that suffice to warn you of its dangers."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I was taught never to talk to the Fuath under any circumstances... Are you sure this is a good idea...?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Through the gate lieth the domain of the Fuath."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Hearken to me, O spirits of the water. We are come with an entreaty."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Not in a talkative mood, apparently."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I'm not exactly sure how the gate works..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But if the Fuath are water spirits, perhaps we should take our search into the lake."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"O-Oh? I...I suppose a brief dip wouldn't hurt..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We all know Thancred swims like an eel, but what about you, Minfilia?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I can swim well enough. Thancred taught me."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Excellent."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"What about you, Urianger? I'm not sure I've ever asked."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"...Rather than swim, mayhap it would be more...expeditious to walk upon the surface by means of magic."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"You too, Urianger!? That you should be a kindred spirit!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Worry not, my friend. I know some helpful tricks, and I should be more than happy to share them with you. Together, we shall conquer the waves!"},{"name":"BOSSOFFUATH","text":"(-Watery Voice-)Well, well, aren't we a lively lot! And you have an entreaty for us, you say? An entreaty from mortals─what a treat!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Aye.

Is that all? Of course, of course! You may have it! You shall have it!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Just like that? What do you want from us?"},{"name":"BOSSOFFUATH","text":"(-Watery Voice-)Ohoho, no need to be so suspicious! The crown simply doesn't mean much to us, is all."},{"name":"BOSSOFFUATH","text":"(-Watery Voice-)As a matter of fact, nothing means much to us. For we Fuath, it's over before it's begun, and we couldn't care less what becomes of the faerie king, nor the world for that matter.

In your tongue, it means “forbidden realm.” Sounds forbidding, yes?"},{"name":"BOSSOFFUATH","text":"(-Watery Voice-)And so it should, for we are one with the water, our home wrought of ripples and waves and currents.

It seems safe to say we must proceed fully prepared."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I'll take sport over pixie chores. Let's give the Fuath what they want."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"When we sally forth, allow me to lead the van. Bearing the brunt is my specialty these days."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"While I was in imperial territory, I learned how to wield the gunblade, but I subsequently let my skills go to rust for want of the ability to replenish my own ammunition."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"When I decided to rescue Minfilia, however, I knew I needed a more defensively minded style, so I placed a special order at the Crystalline Mean, and the rest is history."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I can fight too. I promise I won't be a burden."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"'Twas never like to be simple. Hard though it may seem to believe, the Fuath's love of games surpasseth even that of the pixies."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"And in the name of their games, full many men have drowned.

To wash up on the shore, only to find you weren't with us!?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Oh, but I'm forgetting─here's your crown, Your Majesty! The Fuath kept that part of the bargain, at least!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"While there were certain twists and turns, our work here is done, with everyone none the worse for wetness."},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"Oh! Thank goodness you're still here!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Sul Uin! Is something amiss?"},{"name":"SULUIN","text":"A great big mob of mortals is marching to Il Mheg.

Just remember, we're not your playmates this time."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I'm afraid we must leave the rest of the relic hunt in your hands."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Don't worry. I've done this sort of thing before."},{"name":"A2","text":"It's fine. Defeating the Lightwarden would always have fallen to me."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Indeed you have! Very well, then. See you afterwards, my friend!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Perhaps. But I would feel better if we were there to assist you. &lt;sigh&gt; Back to cheering you on from afar.
