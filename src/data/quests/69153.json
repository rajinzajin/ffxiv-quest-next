Come with me."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I hope you waited for the sundrops to wear off. They work wonders in the dark, but in the light of day they'll only bring you pain."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Every time I step out of those mines the sky seems to get brighter. I'd never leave them if the air weren't so stale..."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"But you're not come to hear my grievances. You're after leonine."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"First, I have to askâ”€you ever heard of rockworms?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Rockworms? I know them by another name, though I'm fairly certain the locals call them knockers."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"Aye, that they do. Whatever you want to call them, those little bastards may be the answer to your troubles."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"They can fit through cracks and crevices down where we could never hope to reach."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"And, on occasion, they come back with something valuable."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"They dig up leonine in the mines?"},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"It's a rare occurrence, but yes. That said, it usually amounts to no more than a few flakes."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Well our only other option sounds tantamount to suicide. So how can we draw out these rockworms?"},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"Over by that shack you'll find a bag full of smoke bombs. Set off a few in the mines and you'll flush them out in no time."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"Once they're out in the open, knock 'em senseless and check their backs."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"I should warn you this method of <span class=\"emphasis\">mining</span>, if you can even call it that, is used as a last resort on account of what little they're like to bring back. You'll want to cover as much ground as you can if you hope to find anything of value."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"Assuming you do find something, bring it here and I'll have a look."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"We should split up if we're to cover more ground as he suggests. If you can cover these three areas on your map, I'll see to the parts between them."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"The smoke bombs are on top of the crates next to the shack just over yonder. You can't miss them."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"I see you've got the smoke bombs, but they'll do you no good out here."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"Light them in the mines and the rockworms will come scampering out before long."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The air in the mines grows thick with smoke. Nearby you hear the soft rumbling of stones."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You sense a hostile presence beneath the rubble!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I found my fair share of rocks. Hopefully there's leonine among them."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"There you are. Find anything promising?"},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"Between the two of you I'd say you've got quite the haul."},{"name":"GUTHJON","text":"Best get comfortable, friends.
