While such a request would usually offend your sense of propriety, so earnest is he that you decide to speak with him again after equipping your gatherer's or crafter's primary tool (item level 50 and higher).","Guiding Star beheld your tool with all the decorum and delicacy called for by the occasion. Judging you to be both sufficiently adept and inadequately equipped, he introduces you to the toolsmith Talan. Deal with this surly smith and surely you will profit by it, in equipage and ability both."],"objectives":["Show your primary tool to Guiding Star."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GUIDINGSTAR","text":"The name's Guiding Star, and you have the look of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">an [Job]</span><span class=\"alternative\">a [Job]</span></span>. My goal is no less than attaining complete mastery of all things crafting and gathering, and to this end I roam the world."},{"name":"GUIDINGSTAR","text":"But I must say that Revenant's Toll offers a sore temptation─the temptation to stay. I'd heard tell that the Adventurers' Guild had thrown its weight behind this place, but I'd no idea of the kind of talent pouring into the camp."},{"name":"GUIDINGSTAR","text":"I could tell just from your hands that you're an adept yourself.

You need go no further than Talan here. He can be a mite testy, but he's one of the finest toolsmiths the realm over, and his selection is impressive."},{"name":"GUIDINGSTAR","text":"Now, he won't simply hand them over. You might need to furnish the man with a bauble or three in exchange. But for an adventurer of your skill, such errands should pose little challenge."},{"name":"GUIDINGSTAR","text":"And if you would walk the lonely road to mastery, why not petition Talan for one of his tomes, too?"},{"name":"GUIDINGSTAR","text":"He calls them “me cookbooks,” for they hold some of the most complex recipes you'll ever see.
