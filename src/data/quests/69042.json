Not these days, though. Most of them left to seek easier, more lucrative prey elsewhere."},{"name":"DALRIC","text":"Still, there's money to be made here, if you're brave enough. How about it? Fancy earning a bit of coin?"},{"name":"DALRIC","text":"I'm sure you have seen the phorusrhacos around here. Big, ugly, highly aggressive. What I want is not their meat, but their eggs."},{"name":"DALRIC","text":"They are a job to carry though, so you'll want to avoid any trouble on your way back from the nest. There's no use bringing a smashed one."},{"name":"DALRIC","text":"If you and the egg both make it back in one piece, bring it here, and the bloke in charge of the warehouse'll take it off your hands. There's gil in it for the both us."},{"name":"DALRIC","text":"The warehouse custodian pays good coin for any meat or eggs, what with them being so hard to come by.

I'll know if you try to cheat me, so don't even think about it!"},{"name":"DALRIC","text":"It'll be easier if you bring the egg straight to the pub."},{"name":"MINER03506","text":"Oh yes, lovely! You don't see many like this! Well, that's Dalric's part of the bargain taken care of. He's got your share, so if you want payin', ask him."},{"name":"DALRIC","text":"Seems to me you've got a talent for this kind of work.
