Very good."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"A botanist's hatchet is his livelihood. Never forget this. If you fail to keep its blade clean and keen, your efforts will yield you naught but sweat and splinters."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"But let us see about your first task... Ah, yes. To help you grasp the basics of botany, I would like you to gather ten pots' worth of latex."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"The forest yields to us many and more resources. It is the botanist's job to know what can be found, and where."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"If it is latex you require, you would do well to search just outside the Blue Badger Gate or the Yellow Serpent Gate."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Seek out the mature trees that stand in those areas, and then put your hatchet to use.

As such, collecting the stuff is an ideal task for young botanists who are learning their way around a hatchet."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Yet know that being able to swing said tool does not make you a botanist. You must also possess the knowledge to locate the resources you seek."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"That will be all from me for the present. I urge you to keep honing your senses and skills as a botanist. Gather near and far, and learn from your experiences."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"I look forward to seeing you again when you have become better acquainted with our trade.
