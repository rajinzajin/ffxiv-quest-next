{"quest":{"name":"For Vengeance","location":"Azys Lla","id":69597,"patch":5.5,"sort":460,"icon":101057,"eventIcon":71201,"issuer":1036953,"target":1036352,"genre":10,"journal":["The restrainment node stands poised to lend a hand...figuratively speaking.","Due to some manner of internal incompatibility between the various systems controlling Tiamat's restraints, it seems you have no choice but to seek out the Flagship's central control terminal. Thankfully, the restrainment node is only too happy to guide you to the sector in which it is located.","After overcoming certain technical hurdles, you are finally in a position to release Tiamat's shackles, though Alphinaud will be required to stay on the Flagship in order to operate the terminal. All that remains is for you to rejoin the rest of the party and begin the great wyrm's treatment.","Alisaie calls forth her porxie and sets to work on Tiamat. While she is thus engaged, G'raha Tia suggests that you ask the great wyrm to recount tales of her life prior to Bahamut's summoning, hopeful that it might help her to recall her true self. This you duly do, and─whether because of your attempts at conversation or in spite of them─the first round of treatment appears to go well.","Drawing deeply upon both your and G'raha Tia's reserves of aether, Alisaie succeeds at last in freeing Tiamat from Bahamut's malign influence. No sooner has she done so, however, than you receive a linkpearl communication from Urianger, who informs you that <span class=\"emphasis\">Lunar</span> Bahamut has been sighted leading a host─including dragons─in the direction of Paglth'an. Determined to atone for past sins, Tiamat immediately takes to the sky with Estinien on her back, leaving the rest of you to formulate a plan of your own.","Sensing your eagerness to rush to the aid of the Amalj'aa, G'raha Tia counsels you to wait for your fellow Scions to assemble before going into battle. And given the might of the enemy you face, that would seem like good advice."],"objectives":["Access the Flagship terminal.","Speak with Alisaie.","Speak with Alisaie again.","Speak with G'raha Tia."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It's possible the restraints may have mitigated the effects of her tempering, but Tiamat has been in thrall to Bahamut for <span class=\"emphasis\">thousands</span> of years. To have clung on to her reason through it all says a lot for her strength of will. More than a lot."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Alisaie and I shall remain here and attend to necessary preparations. In the event that the spirit vessel fails to work as expected, you know where to find me. Good luck."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Cid and his colleagues always make operating these Allagan devices seem so easy..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"I don't know what possessed the Allagans to surround themselves with these chattering orbs, but the fact that they remain while their creators do not speaks volumes..."},{"name":"SECURITYSYSTEM","text":"&lt;bloop&gt; Guiding user to terminal. This way, please."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"This terminal appears to be similar to the one we encountered when we first set foot here. Let us hope it will be equally helpful."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Don't look at me. This is a task for you and Alphinaud."},{"name":"SECURITYSYSTEM","text":"&lt;bloop&gt; Access granted to user <span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span>, and <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> adolescent Elezen companion. Master <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>'s other companion is deemed a potential risk to safe operation and has been denied access privileges until further notice."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Let's see... According to the terminal, the central control system is presently employing...“Software Version 56.135.” Dare I ask which version <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> are employing?"},{"name":"SECURITYSYSTEM","text":"Why, Software Version 42.002, of course.<br>&lt;blip&gt; &lt;bloop&gt; Warning: Errors detected in the data management system. Estimated time required for update: 5 years, 1 day."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"That is...rather longer than we were hoping. Aren't there any other options? For instance, using this terminal to operate Tiamat's restraints instead?"},{"name":"SECURITYSYSTEM","text":"&lt;bloop&gt; The proposed method is indeed an option. Please be warned, however, that the procedure may have changed as a result of the system update, and my instructions may no longer be accurate."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well, I can't imagine it will have changed all that much. As long as we pay due attention to any discrepancies, I daresay we shall be able to muddle our way through."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Don't bother trying to explain. Just tell me if we've made any progress."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I would say so, yes. It does, however, require that I remain here to operate the terminal. I shall inform you via linkpearl once I am ready to release the shackles."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It might be best if you left the spirit vessel with me. I may yet have use for it. Rest assured, I will be certain to return it to G'raha Tia once this is over."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"...Just a little more work and Tiamat will be free."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But before we go any further, there is something I would know."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"When Tiamat and her kin fought against the Allagan Empire, both sides were but dancing to the tune of the Ascians."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"And it was the same in Ishgard, where they stoked the fires of conflict between man and dragon from the shadows."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"All that the Ascians touch turns to ash, and thus have you made it your mission to fight them."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But there have been times when you tried to reach out to them instead. To find common ground."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"And so I must ask: what do you intend to do with Fandaniel? Will you try and reach out to him too?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Enemy or no, I want to understand him."},{"name":"A2","text":"I will try, yes. And if that fails, I'll remember him."},{"name":"A3","text":"Certainly. After I've wiped the smile off his face."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But did he not tell you that he was beyond reason? If he wishes to die, I say we oblige him."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Hmph. I see little point in reasoning with the wretch. Or remembering him for that matter."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Hmph. I'd rather put my lance through his heart and be done with it."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But perhaps that's the difference between you and me. You see the good in people─even if it be but the faintest glimmer. I only hope you do not come to rue your benevolence."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"You think us unwise for viewing the world thus?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Far from it. That has ever been your way, as I learned when we journeyed together with Iceheart."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Yet the fact remains that there are some who view compassion as a weakness to be exploited. And there may come a time when you extend the hand of friendship only to wish that you had dealt the killing blow."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"So...save your mercy for those who deserve it."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"...Well, we should be getting back to our task. If Alphinaud has things in hand here, I suggest we rejoin the others."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I cannot deny the logic in Estinien's argument. Given all that is at stake, even the slightest lapse in judgment could be the undoing of us all."},{"name":"SECURITYSYSTEM","text":"&lt;blip&gt; &lt;bloop&gt; Warning! Releasing dragon restraints may result in specimen loss, damage to facilities, and incineration of staff."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"If this Fandaniel truly is without reason or creed, he is no better than a rabid dog. Treat with him if you must, but be ready to do what is necessary."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"So the spirit vessel proved useful after all? Excellent!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Estinien told me all is well, but nothing more. Honestly, it's like getting blood out of a stone with him. I take it from Alphinaud's absence that he's needed elsewhere?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, that all sounds rather frustrating, but you got there in the end. While you were off talking to nodes, G'raha and I were learning as much as we could about Tiamat's condition."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Our readings confirm that her aetherial balance leans strongly towards the umbral, as was the case with the kobolds. Therefore, all other things being equal, the treatment should work."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"The difficulty lies in the sheer quantity of aether with which we must contend. Multiple applications of the treatment will inevitably be required if we are to reverse the effects of the tempering completely."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Meaning I'll need all the aether I can get. Thank you in advance."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Although this endeavor will ask much of us, we do have one reason to be optimistic."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Namely that Tiamat shows no signs of fanatical devotion, suggesting a milder case of tempering than that suffered by the kobolds."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Hmm... Tiamat saw Bahamut as an equal rather than a god. Might that have made a difference?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Now that you mention it, it very well might. She would not have believed it necessary to defer to his will."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But enough talk─it's time to put our theories to the proof. Tell Alphinaud to disengage the restraints' aetherial dampers!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I'm counting on you, Angelo!"},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)Ahhh, such warmth... The frost that shroudeth my soul doth begin to thaw.<br>But what are these? Visions of days long forgotten...of war with the men of Allag. Wherefore do such baleful memories return to me now?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Could it be that the process of restoring her soul to its pre-tempered state is awakening ancient memories? Or might the opposite be true? If so, by helping her to recall the past, we may be able to speed her recovery!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─she trusts you. Speak to her! Ask her to tell you of times past!"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Tell me of Bahamut and the Ascians."},{"name":"A2","text":"Tell me of your war with the men of Allag."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)Ah, Bahamut...my beloved... Would that the peace we found in Meracydia could have lasted for eternity. But alas, it was not to be... The Ascians saw to that. In all creation, I know of none more wicked. It was at their behest that the men of Allag first came unto Meracydia. Unto our home."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)Wicked, bloodthirsty creatures... Not content with their own lands, they brought fire and death to Meracydia. Our home."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)The tale began when Bahamut and I left our father's side. We took wing in search of a place to make our aery."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)Beyond the southern ocean, we discovered a lush and fertile land. It would come to be known as Meracydia by the children of men, though many years were to pass before they crossed the seas."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)Upon our arrival, we were welcomed by the peaceful people of the forest, kin to the trees. Surrounded by nature's bounty, Bahamut and I had found a place to raise our young."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Fascinating! This correlates with the writings of the Sharlayan scholar Rurusha."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"She posits that man first settled on the southern continent towards the end of the Second Astral Era─correctly, it would appear. If only she were with us to hear the tale from Tiamat herself."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Again, Angelo!"},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)When first the children of man arrived on our shores, no foot did they set in those places over which we held dominion, such was their fear of dragonkind. And as they kept their distance, so did we let them be."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)Yet as the days went by, ship after ship appeared upon the horizon, bearing ever more of their brethren, who divided the vast land amongst themselves."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)For a time, they knew peace and prosperity. But as their numbers grew, the smaller their share came to seem, and soon they began to covet the territory of their fellows. Ere long, man fought man, blood was answered with blood, and none could see an end to the strife. Until, one day, they came to us."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)Recognizing our wisdom, they entreated us to intercede in their conflicts. Bahamut agreed, and with him presiding over the affairs of men, the land knew peace once more."},{"name":"TIAMAT","text":"(-Tiamat-)Alas, those golden days of harmony, too, were fated to end. For the men of Allag slew my beloved, and I, in my rage and sorrow, heeded the envenomed words of the Ascians... The rest, thou knowest only too well."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But your tale doesn't have to end there. When you are free, we'll rid the world of the Ascians together. And you and your beloved will have justice."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Fine sentiments─but you're almost spent. I'll keep watch from above. If the treatment fails...run."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Ugh... Thanks for the vote of confidence!<br>I swear, when this is over..."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Keep going, Alisaie! The magick is working!"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"The girl is as stubborn as her brother. By now, her aether must be all but spent, yet she will not give up."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Slowly but surely, the magick is working, aided no doubt by the memories you bade her share."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"&lt;huff&gt; While I knew this wasn't going to be easy...no patient could have prepared me for treating a great wyrm..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But we're close. I can feel it. And while I've only got a few more drops of aether left to give, with yours and G'raha's, this <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> work."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Then I believe I speak for both of us when I say that you may take as much as you require!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Careful, I might hold you to that...<br>All right, here I go!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Paglth'an... What a curious coincidence."},{"name":"SECURITYSYSTEM","text":"&lt;bloop&gt; Dragon restraints successfully disengaged. Unable to confirm presence of specimen “Tiamat.” Please seek shelter immediately."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"&lt;pant&gt; I'll be fine... Plenty of time to...&lt;pant&gt;...recover on the airship."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"While I'm sure you're desperate to join Estinien and Tiamat in battle, 'twould be wiser to gather the full strength of the Scions first.
