There is news I've been waiting to share with you."},{"name":"ESTRILD","text":"It's that damnable Wlveva. She had the gall to chastise me for inviting passersby to join Clan Centurio. All I ever sought was to bring the thrill of the Hunt to all who cared to know it."},{"name":"ESTRILD","text":"I grant you, no soul save you that I've recruited has ever reported back from their outings. We assume them all fallen. But such is the nature of the Hunt."},{"name":"ESTRILD","text":"I've neither time nor patience for the weak. Let the Hunt cull them from our ranks, I say. If a hundred must die for Clan Centurio to find one such as you, so be it. Aye, I knew you to be of great ability. But never did I suspect you would climb so high."},{"name":"ESTRILD","text":"You've done good by me, and made me proud to call you <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sister</span><span class=\"alternative\">brother</span></span>.

There is nary a soul in the Clan who doubts your ability."},{"name":"WLVEVA","text":"Be welcome to our highest rank, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sister</span><span class=\"alternative\">brother</span></span>. We wish you good fortune on your future hunts. And you will need it, for now you hunt the fiercest prey the Far East has to offer."},{"name":"WLVEVA","text":"On these hunts, we grade our quarry according to its strength. The higher the grade, the greater the bounty. But, of course, so too the greater the danger."},{"name":"WLVEVA","text":"Never has Estrild thought so highly of one of her recruits. You have come far. So far, any further words of warning may be meaningless, but I will give them all the same. Now more than ever, do not overestimate yourself.
