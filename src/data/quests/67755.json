You are to form a party of two with one other adventurer whose compatibility in wealth, adventure, and love you wish to have known. One of you must wear the platinum paramour's earrings, and the other must wear the paramour's earrings before having your fortunes told.

In the waters of Thanalan, fish swim to and fro, hungry for their next meal. It is there you should go if you wish for a chance at a profitable endeavor."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Fill your stomachs with fish caught by your own hands, and contentment at a job well done shall be your reward. Your luck may not be the best, but if you cast your lures wearing <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">coeurl yellow</span><span class=\"alternative\">marsh green</span><span class=\"alternative\">russet brown</span></span>, then your fortunes may improve."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Hmmm... It seems the path to riches may be rather more taxing than you might have hoped. In the dense forests of La Noscea, stout trees await those with the patience to saw through their broad trunks."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Now may be the time to replace your dull wooden furnishings and tools with brand new ones, and take pleasure in the satisfaction hard work brings. What small luck you have in your endeavors may be augmented by an outfit of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">marsh green</span><span class=\"alternative\">russet brown</span><span class=\"alternative\">coeurl yellow</span></span>."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Hmmm... It seems wealth shall only come to you after grueling work. Go deep within the Black Shroud, to where rocks burst with valuable minerals, waiting for a pair of pickaxes to pry them from the earth."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Bedeck yourself in precious metals and gemstones plucked from the soil with your own hands. And what's this? The earth may be more generous with its gifts if you mined wearing an outfit colored <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">russet brown</span><span class=\"alternative\">coeurl yellow</span><span class=\"alternative\">marsh green</span></span>."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Hmmm... You may not be swimming in gold, but neither shall you want for wealth. It may be in your best interests to take a direct approach to riches. With a treasure map to guide you, hunt for wealth long forgotten."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Although after many long and fruitless hours your hope may wane, if you persevere, fortune will see fit to reward you. And what's more, your luck will be much improved if you set out wearing attire colored <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">apple green</span><span class=\"alternative\">bone white</span><span class=\"alternative\">moss green</span></span>."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Oh my. This is not good, not good at all. To be blunt, your luck has run out. Bring your fishing poles to the Black Shroud and wait out this spell of bad luck. Whether you catch fish or not is irrelevant; it is most crucial that you avoid any risky endeavors."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"But beware as well the fish that bite at your lure. Not all taste the same, and an unappetizing catch may make an already bad day worse. Still, there are some measures you can take to mitigate your misfortune. An outfit of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">cream yellow</span><span class=\"alternative\">bark brown</span><span class=\"alternative\">salmon pink</span></span> may serve to keep the worst of it at bay."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Oh dear. It seems fortune has forsaken you. It might be best to indulge in a hobby and wait for this unlucky period to end. Logging, perhaps? Yes... Thanalan would be the perfect place. Lose yourself in the gentle whispers of the desert breeze, until fortune sees fit to smile upon you once more."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"However, I would give a wide berth to anything wrought from wood in the meantime, lest a broken chair result in flushed cheeks and a sore arse. Luckily, you need not live in abject fear of misfortune. Keep yourselves dutifully wrapped in clothes of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">bark brown</span><span class=\"alternative\">salmon pink</span><span class=\"alternative\">cream yellow</span></span>, and you may be spared fate's worst barbs."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Ah... I would not count on fortune to be your ally for the time being. In fact, it may be best to take refuge in the routine, until this run of bad luck comes to an end. The mining in La Noscea is said to be grand this time of year. Yes, busy hands will keep you from inviting hazard."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"But take special care of any precious stones you may own. In a moment, a gem may be slip loose from its setting, never to be seen again. However, it may be possible for you to mitigate fate's cruelty. Clothe yourselves in finery of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">cream yellow</span><span class=\"alternative\">bark brown</span><span class=\"alternative\">salmon pink</span></span>, and perhaps the most unhappy circumstances will pass you by."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Oh no... It seems lean times are ahead of you. Even a treasure map, no matter how detailed, would bring you little more than dirt and a sore back. It's best to give up on any dreams of easy riches for now. You have to be realistic about these things, you know."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Guildleves, however, are just the thing for those who do not─or cannot─rely on luck. Honest pay for honest work. I suggest keeping your pockets filled with those until this unfortunate spell passes. And just to be safe, make sure you conduct the guildleves in attire colored <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lime green</span><span class=\"alternative\">hunter green</span><span class=\"alternative\">olive green</span></span>, or else even those might end in failure."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Ah... Misfortune shall follow at your heels for some time. At all costs, stay away from the gaudy lights of the Gold Saucer! If you step foot into that playground of chance, then all of your hard-earned coin will vanish in a flash, leaving you with scant enough to take the airship back in shame."},{"name":"TREASURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"No, no, that will not do. However, if the allure of the Gold Saucer is too much to bear, at least be content to gaze at it from a distance, your coinpurse far from its grasp. Perhaps if you were wrapped in clothes the color of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">hunter green</span><span class=\"alternative\">olive green</span><span class=\"alternative\">lime green</span></span>, it might afford you some strength to resist your impulses."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"So a pair of adventurers wishes to know if they are destined for song and celebration? It is this very question that my cards will answer, if you so desire."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"A lone adventurer lives a life bereft of companionship. What interest is there in knowing that? Return to me once you've found another."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Ah, such eagerness! Well then, let us begin! Hmmm...<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">a</span><span class=\"alternative\">an</span></span> <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Hyuran</span><span class=\"alternative\">Elezen</span><span class=\"alternative\">Lalafellin</span><span class=\"alternative\">Miqo'te</span><span class=\"alternative\">Roegadyn</span><span class=\"alternative\">Auri</span><span class=\"alternative\">Hrothgar</span><span class=\"alternative\">Viera</span></span> [Job], are you?"},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"And your partner? Yes...your fate is materializing before me. Are you destined for greatness, or will your names be lost to history? Look, and we shall see!"},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Oh my, you are a pair destined for glory indeed! Remain steadfast at each other's side, and they will tell tales of your deeds at the tables of admirals, Seedseers, and sultanas alike! The blessings of Llymlaen shall guide you to riches and renown."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"The Navigator bids you set sail for the far-off islands called the Cieldalaes. There, you shall begin the first of many adventures that shall be remembered far and wide!"},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Ah, one of the Twelve looks favorably upon this pairing! Nald'thal beams down from the heavens. All misfortune you have suffered will be eclipsed by the magnitude of the glory that lies ahead of you."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Nald'thal's smile beckons you beneath the earth. Seek out an ancient wisdom buried in the cavernous deeps, and your search shall lead you to adventures most grand!"},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Ah, one of the Twelve has taken a liking to this pairing! None other than the venerable Halone has granted you Her fury. Any obstacles obstructing your journeys shall crumble before Her might."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"With a reliable airship to carry you, venture to the furthest edges of the Sea of Clouds. Among the verdant isles lies a chance at glory and honor!"},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Ah, you have won the favor of one of the Twelve! The wise Thaliak shall bring harmony to your endeavors together. Even your most difficult tribulations shall serve only to build an unshakable bond between you. "},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Avail yourself of Thaliak's blessing and journey to the ruins of Sharlayan, where behind each crumbling parapet lies the potential for unforgettable adventure. And, what's more, it seems that there may be an unexpected reunion in store."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"One of the Twelve smiles down upon you two! You are fortunate enough to have won the goodwill of Nymeia Herself! Nary a beast can withstand the combined might of this partnership with Her blessing safeguarding you."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"After you have weathered countless trials, your path shall lead you to a weapon of unsurpassed power. With it, you shall fight your way into the annals of Eorzean legend!"},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"While not the most heartening outlook, there is no cause for despair. The solitary islands of the Sea of Clouds hold much promise for grand adventure. But beware, for if you drop your guard for even an instant, you may risk losing everything you have worked for. "},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"It may be best to beseech the Twelve for protection. Go to the mark of the Navigator in Limsa Lominsa, and entreat Llymlaen for Her guidance. To ensure Her blessing's efficacy, carry a fish─alive or dead─with you at all times during your journey."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Hmmm...Azeyma's scales remain level, showing neither favor nor disdain. The omens point to a great adventure slumbering deep beneath the earth. Alas, you cannot hope to succeed in this endeavor without each other's full trust."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Before you depart, journey to the mark of the Dusk Trader in Ul'dah, and beseech Nald'thal to tip the scales ever so slightly to your advantage. During your trials, always carry a precious gem on your selves, as a symbol of His blessing."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Byregot Himself works to build a solid foundation for your partnership. In the Sea of Clouds opportunity for glory lies, but the road to obtain it is fraught with peril. Weather the storm, however, and the suffering will pale in comparison to the ecstasy of triumph."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Before you set off, beseech Halone for aid at the mark of the Fury in the Coerthas central highlands. Make sure always to carry a spear in your hands during your journey, and Her blessing is assured."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"You have the reassurance of Nophica that the storms of hardship you are facing will only serve to nourish your future renown. I sense within the ruins of Sharlayan lie the seeds of adventure most thrilling, but only through concerted effort shall they bear any fruit."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"The gods can offer you further aid, if you but ask. Go to the mark of the Scholar in Mor Dhona, and beseech Thaliak to grant you the wisdom to choose the most favorable path. Keep a shellfish close at hand during your journeys, and the Twelve will not forsake you."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"To see a pair so loyal to each other makes Menphina Herself smile. Set out on a journey to forge a weapon worthy of song, and as the moon waxes, so too shall your work come to fruition."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Surely a journey of creation is worthy of the Builder's blessing as well. Wielding a golden hammer to please the gods, visit the mark of the Builder deep within the Black Shroud and beseech Byregot to lend His steady hand to your work."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"This result is...unfortunate. It seems Llymlaen has turned Her eyes from you. Embark to the seas and you shall be met with only languid winds and clouded skies."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"It would not be wise to journey across the waters, but you may seek the blessing of another of the Twelve. Journey to La Noscea and pray before the mark of the Wanderer, so that at the very least you shall have Oschon's blessing on the land."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Azeyma's scales are weighted against you, and She judges you harshly. Nald'thal has forsaken you, and to venture underground would mean facing the myriad dangers of the earth. "},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Your only chance to reverse this misfortune is to go to Thanalan and entreat the Twelve for mercy before the mark of the Warden. Only then may Azeyma's scales shift in your favor. In the meantime, it is best to stay above ground, safe under the protection of the sun and sky."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Oh my... Through affronts known only to Him, you have earned Rhalgr's wrath. Halone is unwilling to protect you from Her father's ire. Beware any adventures in the Sea of Clouds, for you will surely meet with tragedy."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Your only recourse is to request the blessing of another. Journey to Coerthas and pray before the mark of the Lover, and perhaps Menphina's tenderness will assuage Rhalgr's anger. For the present, make safety and security a priority, and do not take reckless risks."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Ah, it seems you two have become pawns in one of Althyk's inscrutable plots. Thaliak is loath to entangle Himself in such a precarious situation, and any endeavors you have planned in Sharlayan will be steeped in danger."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"The only hope to wrest free from Althyk's machinations is to rely on the aid of another. Go to La Noscea and make your devotions before the mark of the Spinner, so that Nymeia's blessing may improve your fate. For the time being, however, it would be best to ensure each other's safety, avoiding dangerous battles at all costs."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Halone has chosen to test you two, and Byregot dares not interfere with His sister's plans. If you had hoped to build, or craft, be prepared to toil for longer than is reasonable."},{"name":"ADVENTURELUCKTELLER2219","text":"Only one path remains to you if you wish to improve your standing in the eyes of the Twelve. Go to the mark of the Destroyer in Thanalan, and beseech Rhalgr to put a stop to His children's games. Until that time, proceed with caution, and do not let your impatience get the best of you."},{"name":"COMPATIBILITYLUCKTELLER2219","text":"Another couple comes wishing to know if love can bloom between them. Well, 'tis why I am here! But be forewarned: I am but a servant of fate, and my words may not be what you hope to hear. Knowing that, do you still wish for me to divine your affinity for ardor and affection?"},{"name":"COMPATIBILITYLUCKTELLER2219","text":"I don't see a partner with you. Do you expect me to tell you if you love yourself? No, no, that is entirely too dull. Come again with another, and I shall tell you what blossoms between you, be it love or...something else."},{"name":"COMPATIBILITYLUCKTELLER2219","text":"You answer without hesitation!
