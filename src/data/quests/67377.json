The dutiful moogle bids you steal an egg from this nest, but does not say for what purpose. Go to the plaza in front of Zenith and take the egg from under the dragon's snout.","Understandably, the dragon attacks you when you attempt to steal the egg, but you manage to subdue it. Grab an egg from the nest before the dragon recovers.","The egg is warm to the touch, and you can feel the heat of the soon-to-be-born dragon within. Bring the egg back to Mogmont to finally find out what he plans to do with it.","After handing the dragon egg over to Mogmont, he reveals the final step in his master plan: he will return it. However, not before giving the thoughtless dragon an earful and lecturing him on the importance of keeping such a holy place as Zenith clean and tidy."],"objectives":["Obtain a dragon egg.","Deliver the egg to Mogmont."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOGMONT","text":"This aggression will not stand, kupo!
