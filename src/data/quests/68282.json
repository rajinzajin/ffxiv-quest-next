Yes, yes, I believe it is. The adventurer they speak of. I am told you offered your aid to some of my fellow Namazu in their time of need. I wonder if you will see fit to offer it to me in mine."},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"I am in the midst of training some disciples, and could use a bit of help in the doing. I find I tend to go too easy on them. It would be nice to have someone...less biased than myself."},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"If you care to help, come and see me over there. I will have my disciples gathered and waiting."},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"I am glad you have come. Let us begin, then. First, look upon my fine barbels. Within these whiskers lies unbound potential. Limitless, infinite."},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"One among them houses the gift of heightened Namazu detection. It is an ancient art among our kind, and these disciples are undergoing the rigorous training needed to become keepers of its proud tradition. Now, they are three, but for the next phase of their training I desire a fourth."},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"That is why I would like to borrow your strength.

With your combined efforts, it can be done!"},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"Let us four be as one, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sister</span><span class=\"alternative\">brother</span></span>.

That is where my disciples will undergo their next trial. Please, go to them. Speak with the first disciple, and he will tell you all you need be told. Yes, yes."},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"We must combine our strength to complete this trial. Four must act as one. Still, I...I cannot help but feel that something is missing."},{"name":"NAMAZUOSISTERDISCIPLE02746","text":"Leave it to Master to dream up such a trial. To search for something so small in a wilderness so vast... I would never succeed alone."},{"name":"NAMAZUOBROTHERDISCIPLE02746","text":"My barbels... See how they hang? Very limp, very lifeless. This is not their finest hour."},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"There you are, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sister</span><span class=\"alternative\">brother</span></span>. Let us begin. Come, I will tell you of this trial."},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"Somewhere in this wilderness, Master has buried his Namazu bell. We must use our barbels and the ancient art of Namazu detection to find it. We will search with all our focus. You need only ask us in what direction it lies, and we will tell you."},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"The three of us mean to cover as wide an area as possible. You will find us spread out across this swath of land. Come to us to learn what our barbels have found."},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"Follow the directional hints given by the Namazu disciples and /lookout for the location where the Namazu Master's bell is buried."},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"Namazu detection, come to my barbels! Guide me as you guided my forebears!"},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"My Namazu sense is tingling! Master's bell lies this way, I'm sure of it. But...I feel as though it might be some distance yet."},{"name":"NAMAZUOSISTERDISCIPLE02746","text":"Within our barbels lies infinite possibility! Let the search begin!"},{"name":"NAMAZUOSISTERDISCIPLE02746","text":"My Namazu sense is tingling! Master's bell lies this way, I'm sure of it. And it is close. So very close!"},{"name":"NAMAZUOBROTHERDISCIPLE02746","text":"I still have so much to learn. But for now, let us combine our strength to see this thing done."},{"name":"NAMAZUOBROTHERDISCIPLE02746","text":"My Namazu sense is...tingling. I believe Master's bell lies in the other direction. It may be close... Or far... I...I cannot say for certain."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You find the Namazu Master's bell buried in the ground at your feet."},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"I hope we are able to find Master's bell."},{"name":"NAMAZUOSISTERDISCIPLE02746","text":"If you find Master's bell, please give it to the first disciple.

Well done!"},{"name":"NAMAZUOFIRSTDISCIPLE02746","text":"We will head back at once and report to Master. But you, too, should go and see him. He will wish to hear of this from you, as well."},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"My disciples tell me that the four of you were able to find my bell. This trial is done, then. You still have a long path before you, but your journey is underway. That is what truly matters. Someday, greatness such as mine may even be yours."},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"The history of the art of Namazu detection is a long and storied one. Our ancestors used their talents in service of the King of Doma and his prefects to find all manner of thingsâ”€water beneath the soil, veins of mineral wealth, buried treasure."},{"name":"NAMAZUOMASTER02746","text":"With such a proud past, I am not content with the present. My disciples and I will restore the art of Namazu detection to its former glory. We will realize the full potential of these barbels, as the Big One did before us!"}],"reward":{"gil":881,"xp":99900},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":64,"id":34}],"questsType":"all","quests":[68035,68270]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1022467","obj":{"i":1022467,"n":"Old Namazu Master","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022468","obj":{"i":1022468,"n":"Old Namazu Master","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022469","obj":{"i":1022469,"n":"First Namazu Disciple","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022470","obj":{"i":1022470,"n":"Second Namazu Disciple","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022471","obj":{"i":1022471,"n":"Third Namazu Disciple","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022472","obj":{"i":1022472,"n":"First Namazu Disciple","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022473","obj":{"i":1022473,"n":"Second Namazu Disciple","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022474","obj":{"i":1022474,"n":"Third Namazu Disciple","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68035","obj":{"i":68035,"n":"All the Little Angels","g":6,"l":"Yanxia","s":560}},{"type":"quest","id":"68270","obj":{"i":68270,"n":"Perchance to Hanami","g":109,"l":"Yanxia","s":4160,"f":1}}]}
