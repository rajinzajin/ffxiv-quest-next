She bids you and Mathye farewell before taking her leave to return to the cathedral.","Upon approaching the scholasticate, the lector standing at the doors recognizes you, mentioning that Gaetelle was hopeful you would come and visit. Pass through and seek her out.","You enter the humble seminary and speak with Gaetelle about meeting with the headmistress, only to find that she is absent. Instead, Bruvagnon introduces himself as the deputy headmaster, before you are interrupted by none other than Consulting Inspector Briardien, his nephew. The good inspector has been summoned to investigate the theft of the new head of the statue of Saint Valeroyant. For old times' sake, Briardien asks Bruvagnon if you can accompany him as his associate in the case. Bruvagnon seems reluctant for you to be “associated” with the scholasticate, but eventually acquiesces. Join Briardien in his search for the student responsible for supervising the statue work.","The student overseeing the statue's restoration happens to be Theomocent, the student whom you rescued in the Brume. After being questioned by Briardien, he grows skittish and abruptly takes his leave to search for the missing piece on his own. Judging his conduct to be odd, Briardien concludes that the boy is hiding something. While he conducts his own investigation in the Brume, he asks that you search Saint Valeroyant's Forum in Foundation for anyone suspicious, as he believes the thief may be drawn to the broken statue.","In the forum, you find Theomocent pleading with Ben to return the crate containing the head of the statue. In response, Ben angrily accuses Theomocent of accepting the lies of the Holy See in order to have a better life. Leigh soon appears and realizing he is outnumbered, Ben yields the crate and escapes. However, Theomocent seems distraught as he ponders the words of his childhood friend. But he is soon inspired by your courage, and resolves to do his part to redeem the teachings of Halone. The two boys take their leave to return to the scholasticate with the crate.","You return to the scholasticate and see Theomocent and Leigh, who have already returned the statue piece and explained what happened, leaving out the details of who had stolen it. Briardien asks after the culprit, but before you can reply, one of the highborn students, Archombadin, interrupts, claiming to have witnessed Theomocent and Leigh conspiring with another lowborn friend to steal the statue piece and return it to curry favor. Leigh denies the accusation, asserting that you were there and can vouch for their innocence, but Bruvagnon dismisses the students, putting an end to the discussion.","Bruvagnon commends your assistance in resolving the incident and allows you to further accompany Briardien in his work in the scholasticate. However, pointing out the basic level of investigative skill that was necessary to resolve the incident, the inspector remarks that the theft was merely a way to present a more serious problem. He asks his uncle to explain the real reason why his services were requested."],"objectives":["Speak with the scholasticate lector.","Speak with Gaetelle.","Seek out the student in charge of the statue's restoration.","Search for suspects in Saint Valeroyant's Forum.","Report to Bruvagnon.","Speak with Bruvagnon."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GAETELLE","text":"I must take my leave and return to the cathedral.

Forgive me, but I must ask you to meet with her another day..."},{"name":"BRUVAGNON","text":"It truly is a pity, as I too was looking forward to her audience with you. Allow me to formally introduce myself─I am Father Bruvagnon. I have heard much about you from Sister Gaetelle."},{"name":"BRUVAGNON","text":"In the headmistress's absence, I have been charged with tending to myriad administrative matters. While that would ordinarily constitute as simply waxing the seal to a pile of parchments, I have been forced to take a more hands-on approach."},{"name":"GAETELLE","text":"The deputy headmaster and I were just discussing a rather troubling event which occurred soon after our students' encounter in the Brume, and we fear it may be connected."},{"name":"GAETELLE","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>, you are familiar with the statue of Saint Valeroyant?

I made sure to lock the workshop door, so I don't understand how it could have been taken. But worry not! I take full responsibility and will personally see it returned."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"That won't be necessary. Inspector Briardien, at your service. I am told you were recently harassed by several ruffians in the Brume, and I suspect they may be responsible for this theft. What can you tell me about these men?"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"N-Nothing, Inspector! I had never seen them before in my life! A-And besides, why would they want to steal the statue piece? It makes no sense! In any event, as I said, the responsibility is mine and mine alone. N-Now, if you would excuse me."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"Hmph. Admirable sense of responsibility notwithstanding, he's clearly hiding something."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I think we may find our answers in Foundation.

I know you are helping the inspector, but I beg you, let me try to reason with Ben first."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Ben, please return the statue piece and all shall be forgiven. You do understand the consequences of what you are doing? Defiling a saint's monument is a serious crime!"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"When Father Choisseau read us stories at the orphanage, you loved the ones about Saint Valeroyant.

Believe them if you want─you're just as bad as the rest!"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"He...he is right to be angry. I dreamt of teaching our people to walk in Halone's grace. But when the scripture itself has been called into question, how am I to find my own way?"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Whatever should I do...?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Forge your own path."},{"name":"A1","text":"..."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"My own path? You mean...interpret the scripture on my own? A different approach to our faith, to be sure...but mayhap you have the right of it."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"I suppose there is no simple answer. Yet when I look at you, I see one who has walked <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> own path, no matter how perilous. I envy that courage..."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Mayhap the answer to my question is writ not in ink nor carved in stone, but in the strength of mine own conviction."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Forgive me, Ben, but I have come too far to give up now. If Halone's teachings have been distorted by man's hand, then by man's hand must they be redeemed."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"That's all well and good, but we won't change Ishgard by standing around in the snow. At least Ben left us the statue piece. We'd best return it before that prized peacock starts squawking to the deputy headmaster."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"Will you come too, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? I'm sure he will appreciate your help in retrieving it."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"I see you found the boy and the missing statue piece.

We recovered the statue piece, and that's what matters.)"},{"name":"BRUVAGNON","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>, I see you've returned as well.

I thank you for your help in resolving this matter swiftly."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"But there appears to be something missing. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, pray tell...what became of the suspect? Surely these two wish to seek justice for the theft."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"(-???-)Those two will tell you naught, Inspector. For they are the culprits whom you seek."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"Allow me to shed some light on this troubling situation. As a son of House Dzemael, it <span class=\"emphasis\">pained</span> me to learn that our artisans' precious work had been spirited away. So I saw fit to conduct mine own investigation. I followed Leigh at a distance, only to find him and his friend consorting with the culprit!"},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"Camaraderie among orphans of the Brume is to be expected. But to steal a saint's head so that they may “retrieve” it to prove their merit!"},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"(-Composed Student-)And such desperation that they would desecrate a tome in this manner! You would expect a seminarian to treat any holy text with the utmost care─even if they are but children's stories."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"Piss off, you priggish whoreson! <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> was there! <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span>'ll tell you you're wrong!"},{"name":"BRUVAGNON","text":"Enough! You will <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> conduct yourselves with decorum as befits seminarians! Leigh, we will discuss penance for your foul language anon."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"Father Bruvagnon, if I may. The next time the scholasticate apportions work with the sacred monuments, pray entrust the task to me. I am certain the artisans of my house would be at ease knowing their work was in <span class=\"emphasis\">cleaner</span>, more dependable hands."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"And as for my ignoble peers, if the comprehension of advanced scripture is still beyond you such that you require a tattered tome of children's lessons, then allow me to procure for you a new copy with mine own coin. You need not thank me─House Dzemael prides itself on its charity to the deprived."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"M-My tome, if you would! Oof!"},{"name":"JANCHETTE","text":"(-???-)Just how long are you planning to lie there?"},{"name":"JANCHETTE","text":"You're completely hopeless."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Th-Thank you, Blaisie."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"Gah! This is what happens when you let him walk all over you! It'll be a miracle if we're not branded heretics by the end of this term!"},{"name":"BRUVAGNON","text":"Leigh, Theomocent, consider this a warning; you were saved this time solely by <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>'s integrity and the grace of the Fury. But I will not turn a blind eye if you continue to fraternize with questionable company."},{"name":"QUIQUETIN","text":"(-???-)Ah, the insurmountable wall between the highborn and lowborn. I wonder, did our ancestors build it, brick by brick? Or was it fate which drove us apart? And where shall we go from here..."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"Excellent work, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I had no doubts that you would rise to the challenge."},{"name":"BRUVAGNON","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>, I must apologize for the behavior of my students.

Well done."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"If I may be so bold, Uncle. Though I have but arrived, and this is the only case you have had me investigate thus far, I must say that I found it rather a waste of my talents."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"While theft is indeed a serious matter, I cannot help but wonder if this was merely some pretense.
