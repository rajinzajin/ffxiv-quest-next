He supposes that an ink distilled from the regal blood of four beings can contain the power of the materia you propose. The scholar bids you first slay “the king disfigured” in the Wanderer's Palace, and gather the blood it sheds.<br><br>※The Wanderer's Palace can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","You have procured a vial of tonberry king blood. Now present it to Adkin at the Bonfire.","Adkin accepts the vial with untoward glee. Next, he asks you to obtain the blood of “the king imprisoned” in Copperbell Mines.<br><br>※Copperbell Mines (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","The leader of the hecatoncheires is no more, and the vial of royal gigant blood is in your hands. Return now to the Bonfire and offer it to Adkin.","Your latest prize now delivered to Adkin for distillation, the scholar now entreats you to drain the lifeblood of “the king unchained” on Hullbreaker Isle.<br><br>※Hullbreaker Isle can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","You have released the kraken soul from its body and kept its blood as your prize. Adkin no doubt eagerly awaits its delivery at the Bonfire.","You give the vial of kraken blood to an excited Adkin. All that is left is to obtain the life force of “the king forgotten,” found within the Sunken Temple of Qarn where it is said to animate the very stone statues therein.<br><br>※The Sunken Temple of Qarn (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","You have obtained a vial of vicegerent blood. Return with it to Adkin at the Bonfire.","After taking the last vial of blood, Adkin confidently promises he can concoct an ink of unparalleled aetherial conductivity for your sphere scroll. However, he lacks for a proper paper and the means to keep the ink adhered to it. Thus, he bids you procure and deliver a high-quality page of perfect vellum and a pinch of perfect pounce.<br><br>※Certain ingredients required to craft these items can be obtained by desynthesizing aged goods sold at the Silver Bazaar.","Delivery of the requested goods seems to agitate Adkin, and he reveals his ink is lacking in the proper consistency and color. However, he also claims that it is complete but for a Bombard core to purify the blood, sacred spring water to suspend the distillation within, and furite sand found near Ishgardian castles to increase aetherial conductivity. Find and deliver all three.","With every ingredient for both scroll and ink in hand, Adkin triumphantly fashions a Zodiac scroll. He gives it to you with a few words of encouragement on your quest to recreate a legendary arm, all the while crowing that his achievement will bring him all the closer to becoming Master Mutamix's favorite disciple.<br><br>※If you have obtained all four items requested by Gerolt, you may return to Hyrstmill to have your Zodiac Weapon forged."],"objectives":["Obtain a vial of tonberry king blood from the Wanderer's Palace.","Deliver the vial of tonberry king blood to Adkin.","Obtain a vial of royal gigant blood from Copperbell Mines (Hard).","Deliver the royal gigant blood to Adkin.","Obtain a vial of kraken blood from Hullbreaker Isle.","Deliver the vial of kraken blood to Adkin.","Obtain a vial of vicegerent blood from the Sunken Temple of Qarn (Hard).","Deliver the vial of vicegerent blood to Adkin.","Deliver a page of perfect vellum <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> and a pinch of perfect pounce <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Adkin.","Deliver a Bombard core, a bottle of sacred spring water, and a handful of furite sand to Adkin."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ADKIN","text":"You! You are the one who's trafficked with Hubairtin in sphere scrolls, yes? Then stop moving towards him. <span class=\"emphasis\">I said stop moving</span>!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Perhaps you do not yet know me, but you will. Soon, <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> will know Adkin, Master Mutamix's right hand! Now what is it you want?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"A sphere scroll─I <span class=\"emphasis\">knew</span> it! You came to sup of Hubairtin's “knowledge” without paying me any heed. Tut-tut, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"No more, I say! Hubairtin has milked your dealings enough. Today, <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> shall fashion the scroll you seek, and gain Master Mutamix's respect in so doing!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Now hush─I must think. Channeling materia of power beyond compare into an empty host... Tricky."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Only an ink with an unholy level of aetherial conductivity would suffice. Hah, Hubairtin's beloved superior enchanted ink would combust, transferring such energy into a sphere scroll."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"What was it Hubairtin's notes said? Something along the lines of “kill the four kings: disfigured, imprisoned, unchained, and forgotten.” But why? Ah, that's right─for their blood!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"The answer, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, is an ink distilled from blood! Yesss, the blood of these so-called kings, which <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> will be harvesting! Now, your first target is the king disfigured. I believe it can be found in the Wanderer's Palace."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"I am unsure what it actually is, so I say slay anything that moves. Yes, yes, the palace was once sacred ground, but neither the long dead of Nym nor myself care. Now go to your grisly task, and do not return without the blood!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Ah, my friend the slayer. What do you want now? <span class=\"emphasis\">Another</span>!? Well, helping you last time did seem to improve my standing in Master Mutamix's eyes..."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Fine. I will fashion another Zodiac scroll. I will not sully my hands getting the blood for the ink, though, so I hope you remember the method. Yes? Good. I will be waiting."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"...Why are you still here? Must I think of everything!? Go and slay the king disfigured in the Wanderer's Palace, and do not return without its blood!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Is the deed done, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>? Have you a vial of the king disfigured's blood?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Yes, yesss, how disgusting! See how it oozes, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>? This viscosity means untold power!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Ahhh, it seems powerful as ever─though I cannot say I've missed the feeling of bile rising in my gullet."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"I shall begin to distill the essence from this blood─and you will not trouble me with lackwit questions while I am at it!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"...By which I mean, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, that our cause will be better served if you make way to Copperbell Mines. It is home to Ouranos, the king imprisoned; we seek its blood. Now leave me to my experiments, and I'll leave you to the slaying─good-bye!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Ouranos's might is quite legendary─are you certain you can handle the leader of the hecatoncheires?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Yes, yesss! Spending three centuries beneath the ground has imbued the hecatoncheires with unnatural vitality born of malice. I am astounded that you survived, in truth."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"You are something, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>─back at the Bonfire with royal gigant blood in hand. Yesss, your will is frightfully strong."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"We draw nearer and nearer to our goal. You have no qualms with drawing blood again, yes?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Good. Then cross the Doxy's Pull to Hullbreaker Isle, and kill the king unchained!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"What is that awful scent? Oh, it's you...and the stench of the Doxy's Pull, I suppose."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"...Have I lost my mind, or is this blood blue!? &lt;sniff&gt; Blech! And what a foul stench!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Only one azure liquid in the realm smells more rank than a midden─kraken blood. Blech, utterly nauseating!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Still, it ill suits an alchemist of my status to bemoan the odorous. And Master Mutamix will no doubt look on me with respect if I can transform this gunk into ink."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Of course, all this rests upon you obtaining <span class=\"emphasis\">four</span> kinds of blood. You must still slay the king forgotten, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. The Sunken Temple of Qarn is where you are like to find it."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Nothing is known of the blood's owner, but the substance itself is said to be full of magicks. Why, I have even heard it can animate stone! Perhaps a walking statue <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> the king forgotten?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Huuubairtiiin, oh, Huuubairtiiin! I <span class=\"emphasis\">am</span> worthier than you, and when you have fallen from Master Mutamix's good graces, I shall laugh and laugh and laugh!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Huuubairtiiin, oh, Huuubairtiiin! How shall I humiliate you next? Perhaps another Zodiac scroll─how would you like that!? Ahahaha, yes, yesss!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"So this is the blood of the king forgotten! Yesss, you have done alchemy a great service by finding this, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Ahahaha, well done, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>! Gods above, have you no qualms killing for another vial of vicegerent blood!?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Well, can we not now distill four kings' blood into an ink most conductive of aether?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"No. Not yet. This ink is my alchemical masterpiece, and I shall not see its power lessened by something so <span class=\"emphasis\">base</span> as parchment."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"So while I finish mixing the elements of the ink, you may busy yourself with finding a page of perfect vellum to write upon, and a pinch of perfect pounce to ensure the ink's adhesion."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"It matters not to me whether you pilfer or purchase them. Make them by reusing pieces of aged goods from the Silver Bazaar for all I care. One way or the other, kindly go away now─a genius is working!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Blast! ...By which I mean, oh, happy, happy day, you are returned, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>! And no doubt with the vellum and pounce, yes?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Yes, yes, exquisite, really. I owe you a debt of gratitude...or something. But really, must you always be so damned quick!?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"...My apologies, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. I simply need more <span class=\"emphasis\">time</span>, confound it! The ink is proving trickier than I anticipated. My best attempts are...are failures, and I do not like it!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"I...I do sincerely apologize, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. Despite my past success, I am stumbling where I did before. It is...frustrating, to say the least."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"But you will help just one last time, yes? What am I saying─of course you will!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Now, I need a Bombard core to heat the blood and sacred spring water in which to suspend the distillation."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Ah, and furite sand should bring the aetherial conductivity of the ink to new heights. No doubt you can find the pulverized alloy somewhere in the north. After all, those Ishgardians use it in the building of their castles."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Yes, yes, yesss─victory shall be mine! Soon, so soon, I will complete my long labors and take my rightful place beside Master Mutamix."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">Sir</span></span>, you have what I desire, yes?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Oh, how wonderful a friend, how true an ally! I will dip my quill into our ink, and with trembling fingers draw symbols of power upon the vellum. The completion of your scroll is now at hand!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Yes, yesss! I need but a few moments─alone! You may have the scroll, but not the secrets of my craft. They are mine, I tell you! <span class=\"emphasis\">Mine</span>!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Done... It is done! Ahaha, this contrivance will surely make me Master Mutamix's strong right hand. Hah! Hubairtin's day is done, and mine is newly dawned!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Yet...well, I <span class=\"emphasis\">suppose</span> it was Hubairtin who taught me the theory of sphere scrolls. And the adventurer did work long and hard in service of this. Perhaps I should offer my thanks to the pair?"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Ahaha, I do so amuse myself. The very notion that my genius is less than anyone else's is ludicrous! But their contributions shall not be forgotten when I become Master Mutamix's right hand."},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Well, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, here it is: Eorzea's first Zodiac scroll! Take it, with my wish that it serves in your pursuit of the perfect weapon! Ahahaha!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"I am triumphant once again! Twice, twice I have done the impossible. No one can deny my genius now. Why, in a few bells Master Mutamix himself shall invite me to be his right hand, yes, yesss!"},{"name":"ADKIN","text":"Ahaha, take this Zodiac scroll, my friend, take it with my thanks! May it serve to imbue your weapon with the power of materia!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have obtained all the necessary items to recreate a Zodiac Weapon.
