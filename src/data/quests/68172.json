Hmm... Seeing as how I'm in no position to leave the stewpot unattended, could you go and ask Tebbe for a variety of herbs? Six sprigs or so of whatever he's got on hand should suffice."},{"name":"AHELISSA","text":"It's not as haphazard as it may seem. Depending on the recipe, it doesn't really matter what sort you add, so long as you add something. I'll be here when you get back."},{"name":"AHELISSA","text":"If you'd rather not, it's just as well. I can assure you that the folks around here will eat it regardless."},{"name":"TEBBE","text":"Herbs, is it? Six sprigs of whatever's on hand? 'Fraid I can't spare that much. You'll take two, and be glad of it."},{"name":"TEBBE","text":"The remainder you'll have to gather yourself.

Never enough food or supplies to go around."},{"name":"AHELISSA","text":"All the more reason to be grateful when our countrymen can spare some for the cause. Though that comes at a cost, too. Too many villages, too many children more deserving than us..."},{"name":"AHELISSA","text":"But a man can't fight on an empty stomach, can he? So we partake, as we must.
