Introduce yourself to her with a /bow.","Your adroitly executed greeting elicited a response of sorts. Ask Nicoliaux what you should do next.","Nicoliaux suggests that you express the /joy of living, reasoning that it must be something adventurers feel at all times. Show Aunillie the /joy in your heart and see how she reacts.","Your latest efforts have yielded two whole words from Aunillie─<span class=\"emphasis\">double</span> your previous attempt─but she still refuses to laugh. Ask Nicoliaux for further advice.","Nicoliaux suggests you swallow your pride, throw common sense to the wind, and /dance for Aunillie.","The scant vestiges of pride and respectability to which you may once have clung are now gone. However, Aunillie got a good laugh out of it. See what Nicoliaux has to say.","When her father died during the Calamity, Aunillie became quiet and withdrawn. Even now, more than five years later, she rarely laughs, which continues to trouble Nicoliaux. Though he would deny it vehemently, it seems the boy is maturing into one of the adults he delighted in tormenting not so very long ago."],"objectives":["Greet Aunillie with a /bow.","Speak with Nicoliaux.","Express your /joy to Aunillie.","Speak with Nicoliaux.","/dance for Aunillie.","Speak with Nicoliaux."],"dialogue":[{"name":"TALK","text":"I know all about adventurers!
