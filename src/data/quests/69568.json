Cid has been called in to determine whether this was caused by the synthetic auracite system, but is not yet ready to deliver his findings. While you wait, Severa suggests speaking with Avilina, who apparently has something she wishes to discuss.","Avilina's monument has finally been completed, and it stands as a lasting reminder of Terncliff's fallen. She then absorbs herself in prayer, which serves as your cue to return to Severa and ask if she has any news on Allie's condition.","Back in the town square, Severa informs you that Gaius is due to return to Terncliff soon. You take a moment to savor the refreshing sea breeze and picturesque scenery while you wait for him to arrive.","You are eventually joined by Gaius, who wastes no time inquiring after Allie. Cid brings her out from the infirmary and all present are taken aback to see that she is but a shell of her former self, utterly unresponsive and incapable of even the most basic communication. According to Cid, the trauma from which she is suffering is not the result of the synthetic auracite system, but more likely caused by learning of the terrible fate that befell her brother Alfonse. Gaius reaffirms his desire to fulfill his promise to Alfonse by overseeing the restoration of Werlyt as an independent state. Cid decides to let bygones be bygones with Gaius, and bids the group farewell.","Severa reveals that her encounters with Gaius's foster children have given her the determination to find a place for herself in the world. She plans to accompany Gaius to Werlyt, her former home, and win over those who once shunned her.","The time that Valdeaulin has spent alongside Gaius has dulled his desire for revenge, and he has come to see he made the right decision in sparing Gaius's life all those moons ago. His doubts regarding the former Black Wolf's sincerity now assuaged, he decides to cast aside his hatred and work towards the revival of Werlyt.","A member of the Werlyt Revolutionaries arrives with a group of small boys, who were until recently wards of Valens van Varro. Gaius introduces himself to them, and though they are initially petrified, they listen intently to his tale. He tells the story of the five orphans and their fight to win the freedom of Werlyt, and ends by asking the boys for their support in the days to come. Gaius then turns to you and speaks of his realization that true strength is not the power to impose one's will on others, but instead comes from within. Before parting, he asks that you give a verbal account of recent events to the Resistance officer stationed in Porta Praetoria.","You receive a warm welcome upon returning to Porta Praetoria and congratulations for finally ending the threat posed by the Weapon project. Though your part in the struggle may be over, Gaius, Severa, and Valdeaulin will endeavor to see the wishes of Alfonse and his siblings fulfilled by helping to rebuild Werlyt as a bastion of liberty and equality."],"objectives":["Speak with Avilina.","Speak with Severa.","Wait at the specified location.","Speak with Severa.","Speak with Valdeaulin.","Speak with Gaius.","Speak with the Resistance officer."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SEVERA","text":"The recent events in Werlyt have had a profound impact on the lives of many, many people, but none more so than Allie. She's been in a state of shock ever since she returned. We've even called in Cid to see if he can ascertain what the problem might be."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"You see, there's a strong possibility that the Diamond Weapon itself is what's caused Allie to close herself off like this. But for the time being, all we can do is wait."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"Ah, there was one other thing. Avilina came by looking for you earlier, so perhaps you could go and see her?"},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"I can see how heavily the burden weighs on him, just as it does on me. In truth, it never gets any lighter. We can only hope to grow strong enough to bear it."},{"name":"CONVEYOR03783","text":"If you're making your way to Terncliff, allow me to escort you."},{"name":"Q10","text":"Travel to Terncliff?"},{"name":"AVILINA","text":"Thank you for coming to meet me.

Now would be a good time to return to Severa."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"When I last saw Avilina, she was headed towards the new monument. Is it true that she oversaw its construction?"},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"I hope all is well with Avilina. Actually, while you were speaking with her, I received word that Gaius will be here soon."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Avilina is absorbed in prayer.

Her mind has been scarred, perhaps irrevocably."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"...She boarded the Diamond Weapon with the intention of saving her brother."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Little did she know that Valens had used the synthetic auracite system to transform Alfonse into a living component of the machine."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Then, when she boarded the Diamond Weapon..."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"...she finally learned the horrible truth."},{"name":"CID","text":"I've never heard of anything so cruel..."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"Just a moment. In each of the previous cases, pilots became fused with the Weapon's core. So how was Allie able to escape a similar fate?"},{"name":"CID","text":"That's one of the many things we're still looking into."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"There is no need. I already know the answer: it was Alfonse who kept her safe."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"In the end, I was unable to save your brother. My son."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"All they wanted was a place to call home, where they could live in peace. But after all the pain and hardship they endured, <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span> is their reward?"},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"No. This is not the end of their story."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"I taught them the strong must lead the weak. But absolute power corrupts absolutely, and those who have suffered at the hands of the corrupt are beyond counting."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Alfonse dreamed of a land without oppressors and the oppressed, where all may live as equals. Thanks to his sacrifice, and that of his siblings, the cornerstones of such a nation have been laid."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Milisandia, Ricon, Rex, Alfonse, and Allie. They risked everything to win the freedom of Werlyt."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"And now, it has come to pass."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"I will see that their ideals are upheld. This I swear. As their father."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"The long and arduous process of rebuilding Werlyt has begun. In the days to follow, I shall be working alongside the new government to create a place that people like Allie and Severa would be proud to call home."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"For so long, all that kept me alive...was hate. But the time has come to cast it aside."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"I'm going with you."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"I'll only regret it if I don't. And while nothing I do can bring back the ones I've lost, I owe it to them to make the most of the life I've been given."},{"name":"CID","text":"Times change. People change. And it's just as well─we inventors would soon find ourselves out of work if everything stayed the same. If you've a need for my creations, just say the word."},{"name":"CID","text":"You know, Gaius, I could fill a book with all the things I've been meaning to say to you over the years. But what would be the point? What's done is done.<br>...There is one thing, though."},{"name":"CID","text":"If anyone can get through to Allie, it's you. She looks up to you the same way I did as a boy. Don't give up on her."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"Perhaps in time, Allie will return to some semblance of her former self."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"For all my life, I've been searching for my place in the world. Everywhere I went, I was always on the outside looking in."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"But I've realized if we can't find one, we just have to make it ourselves."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"That's what I learned from Gaius's children. Despite everything, they never gave up, and neither will I."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"For now at least, my place is at Gaius's side. I'll follow him and see where this journey leads."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"And before I leave, I want to tell you how grateful I am that you chose to stand by us until the end. I hope we'll meet again one day."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"I would not have made it this far without my constant companions, Valdeaulin and Severa. In fact, I believe she has a few words to share with you."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"It's taken me a long time─too long─but I've finally found a reason to live for the present. For the future."},{"name":"ALLIE","text":"..."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"All this time, I'd been trying to convince myself that Gaius was every bit the villain I'd imagined him to be. The ruthless subjugator of nations. Evil made flesh."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"And while many who fight under the banner of Garlemald are all that and worse, I realize now that Gaius was driven by his own notions of right and wrong, misguided as they were."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"Since then, he has turned his back on the Empire and its hateful doctrine. His guilt and anguish only strengthen his resolve."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"The day I spared his life, he was given a second chance. To set right the wrongs he had committed. To become the man his children believed him to be."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"I was a father once. A husband. In many ways, I still am. And even though they're no longer with me, I want to be someone they would be proud of. Now, I too have been given a chance to make a difference. In a land far from home."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"I'll never forget my past, but neither will I be beholden to it. When I meet the people of Werlyt, I'll be sure to tell the tale of your bravery and compassion. May it grant them the strength to face the struggles ahead.<br>Pray, go in peace, my friend."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"I must admit, the thought of returning to Werlyt fills me with apprehension. As a half-Garlean and former imperial soldier, it won't be easy to gain acceptance. But if they're willing to turn to Gaius Baelsar of all people for help, anything's possible!"},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"I understand that Valdeaulin wishes to speak with you."},{"name":"AVILINA","text":"Now that the Weapon project has come to an end, I'm searching for a way I can use my engineering skills to help others. I'm sure the same technology used to build warmachina can be used for more peaceful ends."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Though we were brought together under strange circumstances, Valdeaulin, Severa, and I will continue to work together, at least for the foreseeable future."},{"name":"HIGHOFFICIAL3783","text":"Well, here they are."},{"name":"SEVERA","text":"And who might these charming young men be?"},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"They were found in the VIIth Legion's headquarters, in one of the few areas that escaped unscathed following the Diamond Weapon's rampage. Perhaps that was Alfonse's intention..."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Do not be afraid. We mean you no harm."},{"name":"ELEZENBOY03980","text":"(-Elezen Boy-)That th-thing...on your forehead..."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"My name is Gaius Baelsar. And like Valens van Varro, I was once a legatus of the Garlean Empire."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Though I believed I was fighting for a just cause, my conquests came at a terrible cost."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Pray, forgive me. I do not mean to scare you. If you would lend me your ears, I have a story to tell."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"A group of courageous young men and women, not so different from yourselves, stood up to protect their people from the tyranny of the Empire. They fought with everything they had, and finally, victory was theirs. But it came at a terrible price..."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"As their father, I still struggle to come to terms with their sacrifice. And yet, they have entrusted the future to me, and I will stop at nothing to see their dream fulfilled."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Even so, there is only so much one old soldier can achieve by himself. I would be honored to have your support in the days to come."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"At ease, lads. He's not as scary as he looks."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"And if he steps out of line, he'll have me to answer to."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Though they were fortunate enough to escape the destruction of the castrum, they may have been injured while fleeing. Have the chirurgeons look them over and find a place for them to stay."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"It seems the time has come for us to go our separate ways once more."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"I myself can scarcely believe that we were once bitter adversaries. But my encounters with you have led me to question the very ideals I swore to uphold."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"What is strength? What is weakness?"},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"If those who grasp the reins of power are said to be the strong, then those who lack such power must therefore be the weak. For better or worse, however, we are far more complex creatures than that."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"I see now that true strength is not granted by others, but resides within us. Strength of character, of spirit, of resolve."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Therein lies the power to cast off the shackles of oppression, to overcome any adversity, to stand firm in the face of impossible odds."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"That is the strength you possess. May it never leave you."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"It seems I will have to summon all the resolve I can muster if I am to keep my promise to Alfonse. The process of establishing the independent governance of Werlyt is underway, and I will do all in my power to see it become everything my children dreamed of and more."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"For the immediate future, we shall continue to work closely with the Ala Mhigan Resistance, whose role in the revolution cannot be understated. That reminds me, if you are passing by Porta Praetoria, the soldiers stationed there wish to hear your version of events."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"Please give them my regards."},{"name":"SHADOWHUNTER","text":"I hope that when our paths cross again, I will have glad tidings to share with you. Until next we meet."},{"name":"VALDEAULIN","text":"While I may no longer have a place to call home, I now have the opportunity to help the people of Werlyt rebuild theirs. And who knows? Perhaps I will choose to settle down there one day."},{"name":"RESISTANCEOFFICER","text":"Welcome back, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Congratulations on another hard-earned victory!"},{"name":"RESISTANCEOFFICER","text":"Ever since we first heard the news, I've been dying to hear exactly how it all unfolded. So, what can you tell me of this Diamond Weapon?"},{"name":"RESISTANCEOFFICER","text":"By Rhalgr's beard... Even for the Empire, that must be a new low. Those poor orphans..."},{"name":"RESISTANCEOFFICER","text":"I can only pray that the citizens of Werlyt are able to enjoy the freedom that Gaius's wards gave their lives for."},{"name":"RESISTANCEOFFICER","text":"At the very least, we need no longer live in fear of the monstrous creations birthed by the Weapon project. I shall add your account to our official report."},{"name":"RESISTANCEOFFICER","text":"Finally, on behalf of the Ala Mhigan Resistance─and the whole of Eorzea, for that matter─allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude!
