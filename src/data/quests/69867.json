Have you heard of the winged familiars known as the skatene? They've a marked talent for seeing in the dark, which has established them as the chosen watchbirds for some of the world's most important facilities."},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"As it so happens, we in Labyrinthos avail ourselves of their astonishing eyesight, too. Day and night, our skatenes keep close watch for any blackguards or nasty goings-on."},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"However, such keenness of eyesight requires─for lack of a better term─upkeep, which comes in the form of special eye drops. After all, what creature can sit unblinking and wide-eyed for days on end without help? So, might I ask you to dole out said medication?"},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"How good of you to be so obliging. The skatenes are perceptive creatures in both sight and mind, and will take to you instantly once they know you've experience in caring for even one of their kind."},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"That is why I recommend all those who deal with things of a confidential nature to try their hand at treating the beady eyes of our vigilant familiars at least once."},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"Near the northmost entrance you'll find the skatenes' caretaker. She'll be only too glad to introduce you to our faithful watchowls."},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"The skatenes are keen of both vision and mind, and will warm to you once they know you can be trusted. If they mistake you for some common criminal, however, the consequences would be dire indeed. If you're lucky, though, they'll just peck out your eyes."},{"name":"SUPERVISOR04331","text":"..."},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"You're the one who's come about the eye drops, then? Heard all about today's little exercise from A'naidjaa─called me via linkpearl, you see."},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"I told this ol' bird what's about to transpire, but she still seems a bit on her guard. Might be best to calm her down yourself. If you <span class=\"highlight\">pet</span> her gently, that ought to unruffle her feathers, figuratively and literally."},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"How is it all panning out? Well, I hope?"},{"name":"SUPERVISOR04331","text":"..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The skatene on guard duty eyes you warily. Perhaps you should <span class=\"highlight\">pet</span> her before she gets...peckish."},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"These creatures do love to be <span class=\"highlight\">petted</span>. Surprising, I know, given the look of them."},{"name":"SUPERVISOR04331","text":"..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The vigilant skatene continues her unwavering stare, but there is now a great deal less anxiety in her eyes than before."},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"Think our friend here has realized you're no threat at all. Go on, then. She's ready for the eye drops whenever you are."},{"name":"SUPERVISOR04331","text":"..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The skatene watches you closely. Now is your chance to administer the eye drops."},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"There's nothing to worry about. Our skatene here'll be amenable to a few drops of that medicine you brought along."},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"Why, she looks about ready to snuggle up to you, I'd say. Skatenes have a mind like a steel trap and don't forget a face easily, so it's no problem if you were to walk past in completely different clothes. Takes more than a costume change to fool them, after all!"},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"If you don't mind my asking, you're friends with a dragoon, right? Surly looking Elezen fellow, as I remember. I'm afraid the skatenes didn't take kindly to him─damn near pecked his eyes out. This poor bird almost got a lance in her gullet for it."},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"Lucky your companion stopped himself when he did, but that doesn't mean the skatene is going to let bygones be bygones any time soon, let me tell you. Bit of advice: he ought to watch himself if he's walking through these parts."},{"name":"MAGUS04331","text":"In any case, your work is done here. This skatene's had her treatment, so go and tell A'naidjaa as much. Good luck out there. Oh, and should you happen to see another skatene while you're about, give them a wave, all right?"},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"You've returned. Very good. Judging by the lack of scratch marks, you were successful in completing your task. No doubt the skatenes now know to treat you as a friend rather than foe."},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"The skatenes do not stay long in any given location, but rather fly through Labyrinthos, moving from perch to perch. Should you happen to see one, count yourself fortunate. They can be a rare sight."},{"name":"ANAIDJAA","text":"Though you may think them difficult to spot, trust that they are among us. They are watching always, ensuring that the knowledge we've acquired is kept from falling into the hands of those who would use it for nefarious ends."}],"reward":{"gil":735},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69982]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1037560","obj":{"i":1037560,"n":"A'naidjaa","l":3708,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69982","obj":{"i":69982,"n":"Hither and Yarns","g":11,"l":"Labyrinthos","s":600}}]}
