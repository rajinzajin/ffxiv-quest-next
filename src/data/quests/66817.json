Moxia entrusts to you two phials of morbol gall, an acidic substance derived from morbol bile, and urges you to speak with the mysterious sylph at the entrance to the Sylphlands before embarking on your mission.","The mysterious sylph works her magic to render you transparent. Seek out the milkmist makers and destroy them using Moxia's morbol gall.<br><br>※You must complete the task before the enchantment expires. The fragrant blooms you encounter on your path will extend the duration of the spell.","With the milkmist makers dissolved by the power of morbol bile, the forest air begins to clear. Report your success to Moxia.","Moxia thanks you for your efforts, making sure to reiterate that her odd behavior before was solely due to milkmist exposure. That said, she will doubtless have occasion to call upon your aid again."],"objectives":["Speak with the mysterious sylph by the entrance to the Sylphlands.","Use morbol gall on milkmist makers.","Report to Moxia."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOXIA","text":"Brave one is back to see this one, yes?
