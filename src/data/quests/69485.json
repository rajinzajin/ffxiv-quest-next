Its extraction will prove to be a delicate process, which is why Mikoto insists that they accompany you to the site.","You reach the extraction site only to find your two companions being assailed by Garlean soldiers. Weapon in hand, you rush in and give the imperials a terrible thrashing, forcing them to make a hasty retreat. The danger passed, you check to see if Mikoto and Misija are injured.","With the extraction device ready, Mikoto sets the crystal focus in place, patiently waiting for its reserves of aether to be restored. After a few moments, Misija removes the focus from the device, confusing Mikoto. Her confusion quickly turns to panic, however, when Misija draws a gun on her, ordering you to lower your weapon. Unwilling to risk Mikoto coming to harm, you do as you are told. In a flash, Misija and Mikoto are gone, along with the crystal focus.","You return to camp, alone and empty-handed, much to the dismay of Bajsaljen and the others. For lack of soldiers to pursue Misija and rescue Mikoto, Bajsaljen believes their best course of action is to proceed as planned and storm Castrum Lacus Litore.","Resistance scouts have yet to find any sign of Mikoto, but it is no reason to give up hope. When the castrum falls, Bajsaljen is hopeful Mikoto's rescue will follow shortly after."],"objectives":["Rendezvous with Mikoto.","Rescue Mikoto.","Speak with Bajsaljen."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"A Resistance rank of [#1] is required to proceed with this quest."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"It worked, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

My head..."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"My apologies, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Our preoccupation with the extraction device left us all but oblivious to their approach.

It's definitely the place."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Then let us begin."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"How much longer until its energies are fully restored?"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"An excellent question, but unfortunately a rather difficult one to answer with certainty."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Considering the high concentrations of aether it has absorbed thus far, I would imagine it has sufficient stores to suit our purposes. We must be mindful, however, that the naturally occurring aether of this location will take time to restore itself should we need to charge the focus again.  "},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Again? No... I don't think that will be necessary."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Pardon?"},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"One false move and she dies!"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Misija? What...

And you say she stole the crystal focus as well?"},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"I fear we have little time to determine the how and why of her betrayal. Mikoto's rescue must be made a priority."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Be that as it may, Misija may not have been working alone. I need you to bring me a list of any close acquaintances she had within the Resistance. I have questions for them..."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Yes, sir!"},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"If I am to be completely honest with you, we haven't the troops to spare for Mikoto's rescue.

You have my word."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Meanwhile, at Castrum Lacus Litore..."},{"name":"RIAN","text":"...And I'm tired of sitting about with our thumbs up our arses!"},{"name":"RIAN","text":"Why wait for reinforcements when we could wipe the Bozjan Resistance off the board in one fell swoop? Even with just the troops stationed here at the castrum, they wouldn't stand a chance!"},{"name":"ALBIREO","text":"You have already demonstrated gross insubordination by leading charges into the field against orders. Soldiers have been court-martialed for far less, and such behavior ill befits one of your station."},{"name":"ALBIREO","text":"I need not remind you that our true objective is the subjugation of Dalmasca and the seizure of its resources, not to engage in petty skirmishes with these Bozjan curs."},{"name":"ALBIREO","text":"They will be dealt with in due course, but only once the Dalmascan resistance has been annihilated."},{"name":"RIAN","text":"Who do you think you're talking to, boy? I know full well that we need to bring Dalmasca to heel, and I've said from the beginning that invading Bozja was a waste of time. The sooner we get this over with, the better."},{"name":"MENENIUS","text":"A waste of time... Yet who was it front and center during the invasion? I hope you have not forgotten the soldiers you sacrificed for the sake of this “waste of time.”"},{"name":"ALBIREO","text":"Retaining our foothold here is essential to our plans.

But so long as I have a hand to play, am I wrong to keep it?"},{"name":"RIAN","text":"That's the way of it, eh? Fine, stay here and hatch your schemes.
