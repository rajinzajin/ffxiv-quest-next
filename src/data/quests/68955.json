Accidentally consumed a poisonous plant, it would seem."},{"name":"EOAN","text":"A Nu Mou named Iala Oul makes a medicine that can purge the poison. I would take myself to Pla Enni for it, but I dare not leave my friend's side. If you could go in my stead, I would be in your debt."},{"name":"EOAN","text":"It's the Nu Mou named Iala Oul that makes the medicine. If you could go to Pla Enni and obtain it for me, I would be in your debt."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"An amaro is unwell, you say? But of course I would be happy to help. Nu Mou or no, I would not forsake those in need."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"That being said, as per our custom, I must ask for a fitting payment. Let's see... Yes, four sprigs of Voeburtwort should suffice."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"The herb grows in abundance outside the cave in Voeburtenburg. Bring them to me, and I will see that the ailing amaro has his medicine."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"Voeburtwort grows in abundance around Voeburtenburg. Bring it to me, and I will see that the ailing amaro has his medicine."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"Ah, you're back. Do you have the Voeburtwort?"},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"Ah, four sprigs, precisely as requested. This will replace the amount I used to make the medicine, which I should mention has already been delivered to Wolekdorf. It wouldn't do to make the sick and ailing wait, after all."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"But I must say─and perhaps I'm simply imagining it─even though the amaro I met with was appreciative, there was an aloofness about him at the same time. At any rate, the honorable task is done, and to great satisfaction for all."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"If you require anything else, do not hesitate to let me know."},{"name":"EOAN","text":"Yes, Iala Oul indeed came earlier with the medicine. I gave it to my friend at once, and already he is feeling better. Thank you so much for procuring the herbs."},{"name":"EOAN","text":"Now, forgive me if this seems like prying...but how do you find dealing with Iala Oul?"},{"name":"EOAN","text":"Truly? You are a far more patient soul than I am."},{"name":"EOAN","text":"Every time I meet Iala Oul, or indeed most other Nu Mou, they never fail to ask if something ails me. Even when I say no, they press me, again and again."},{"name":"EOAN","text":"I realize it is simply the way with them, but it becomes overbearing very quickly. And <span class=\"emphasis\">that</span> ails me. Thus do I make a point of keeping my distance with them."},{"name":"EOAN","text":"You should keep your distance as well, lest you be drawn deep into their endless web of tasks."}],"reward":{"gil":1344},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}],"quests":[68854]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1027692","obj":{"i":1027692,"n":"Eo An","l":2956,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68854","obj":{"i":68854,"n":"A Resounding Roar","g":8,"l":"Il Mheg","s":400}}]}
