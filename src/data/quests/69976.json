For some time, I was...not myself."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"Lucia and the others told me what happened that night...and about the events that took place while I was receiving treatment."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"It was only then that I realized the lengths you and yours go to... I know I might never be able to repay you, but I'll be damned if I don't try."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"And most of all... I want to thank you. All of you. For everything you've done and continue to do for the sake of my people."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I daresay Master Fourchenault was as nonplussed as we to learn the identity of Hydaelyn's lunar custodians. As he will soon discover, they have much and more to offer the Forum."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Might I suggest we return to the annex forthwith?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"We may yet have time to discuss thy recent adventures ere we are summoned to the Rostra."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Not that I'm complaining, Urianger, but I wasn't expecting to see you <span class=\"emphasis\">quite</span> so soon."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Nor I thee. In extolling the virtues of Etheirys, I did inadvertently awaken in the Loporrits a desire to avert our beloved star's demise."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Krile tells us you have obtained new knowledge that may aid us in our ongoing efforts."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I've news to share regarding our study of the aetherial sea, but your findings are certain to be of greater interest, and so I would rather hear them first."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"To what revelations did Hydaelyn's Elpis flower lead?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Then this “dynamis” is what drives the Final Days..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If it and akasa are one and the same, this all but proves Nidhana's theory."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Were an entity, through sheer force of emotion, to channel this vast, dormant reservoir into a raging river...its power might surpass even that of aether."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But if our star is so replete with aether, said entity would need to be outside its influence to effectively manipulate the dynamis of the great expanse."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Meteion..."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Or rather, the sorrow and suffering of fallen civilizations that she has been hoarding for millennia..."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Untold anguish and fear and hatred, drawn from every corner of the universe... All for a single purpose: the destruction of Etheirys."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Then our foe is no longer some unknowable calamity."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"We have but one aim─to defeat Meteion."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"You make it sound so simple...but you're not wrong."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Vanquish Meteion and we deliver the world from the Final Days. But to even attempt it, there are two conditions."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"First, we must determine her location."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Before Meteion escaped, an enchantment was placed upon her by Venat. The woman who would become Hydaelyn."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"The implications of temporal magicks are not entirely understood, and so we cannot assume that our Hydaelyn and the Venat you met in Elpis are one and the same. Nevertheless, due to Her intrinsic qualities as an all-powerful being, I'd wager that Hydaelyn possesses the knowledge we seek."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Whether She would share that knowledge with us, however, remains to be seen."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"After all, She intends for us to flee Etheirys, not to stay."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Do you suppose She has abandoned Her pursuit of Meteion?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"The Venat I know would never give up."},{"name":"A1","text":"No, but Meteion is still out there."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"That's my impression, too. Otherwise, She wouldn't have used me as a conduit for Her will, or provided clues such as the Elpis flower."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Aye, though not for lack of trying on Hydaelyn's part. Surely, that's why She used me as a conduit for Her will, and provided clues such as the Elpis flower."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"I believe She has been waiting..."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"...For mankind's answer to Hermes's question."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"So, what's the second condition?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"We must find a means to reach Meteion."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Naturally, our chosen method will depend entirely upon wheresoever she has made her nest."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Then communing with Hydaelyn must by necessity come first."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Did you and Master Matoya have any luck with your investigation into the aetherial sea?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Sadly not. Though we enlisted the help of Arenvald and other Echo-blessed allies, we couldn't detect so much as a whisper from Hydaelyn, even from within the Antitower."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Master Matoya is of the opinion that in the years since abandoning it, the Forum has found some other method of receiving instructions from Hydaelyn."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"If so, it would most likely be some form of apparatus for observing the aetherial sea, built closer to home."},{"name":"OJIKATSUNJIKA","text":"(-Ojika Tsunjika-)Sorry to interrupt, we've just received word from the Forum."},{"name":"OJIKATSUNJIKA","text":"(-Ojika Tsunjika-)Your presence is required in the Rostra, where they intend to discuss the great exodus."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Then Father was able to persuade them!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"They're finally taking us seriously. Let's hear what they have to say."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Father has granted us the opportunity we've been waiting for."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Though we know not what information─if any─they intend to reveal, there's only one way to find out. To the Rostra!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, that was a much quicker response than I was expecting. Nice to know our efforts on the Magna Glacies didn't go unnoticed."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"After sending G'raha and Estinien back to Garlemald, I stayed in Locus Amoenus for a time. Being an imperial province, it was already in turmoil before the onset of the Final Days."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"You wouldn't believe the difficulties we had overseeing the evacuation of the villages we visited. I have faith the detachment we left behind will continue our work and shepherd the people to safety. To what safety can be found in a world coming to an end."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"'Twas Hydaelyn's commandment that in the event Zodiark should perish, the Loporrits were to deliver the people of Etheirys from harm."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Though that be the limit of their duties, they possess knowledge unparalleled of the great expanse and the means of its traversal."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Should they be persuaded to assist in our efforts to reach Meteion, we would do well to heed their counsel."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Master Matoya has suspected for some time that the Forum has been constructing a new facility for the purpose of surveying the aetherial sea."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Of course, as the custodian of the Antitower, which would presumably be rendered obsolete as a result, she has a few things to say about that. Nothing that should be repeated in polite company, you understand."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"To think the Crystal Tower of the First is capable of such feats as sending one's soul into the distant past..."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"The events you witnessed─and helped shape─may yet hold the key to forestalling the Final Days."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I'm reminded of dear friends in a future I unmade. Whose selfless efforts saw the Eighth Umbral Calamity averted...in this timeline, at least. Too much has been sacrificed for us to abandon Etheirys now."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"At first, I wasn't sure what to make of Hermes and his motives."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But it's like we discussed at the Great Work. When faced with the harsh realities of life, some seek the release of death. Others grow defiant. They fight."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Either way, it is our right to choose."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"After you left for Garlemald, I went to Labyrinthos and tried to reach Hydaelyn using the Elpis flowers."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Alas, my attempts were in vain. I can only assume that She spent a vast amount of Her power in the confrontation with Fandaniel and is presently unable to communicate."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Indeed, as Her presence left my body, I could feel how faint it had grown..."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"I hope you don't mind me staying behind while you attend your big meeting."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"The Rostra reminds me a bit too much of the Supremely Scary Tribunal in Ishgard. You'll forgive me if I keep my distance..."},{"name":"THEROSTRAGUIDE04440","text":"The Forum is in session, and as such, the Rostra is closed to visitors."},{"name":"THEROSTRAGUIDE04440","text":"A Scion of the Seventh Dawn? Very well, you may wait in the corridor."},{"name":"THEROSTRAGUIDE04440","text":"Of course, entry will only be permitted on the condition you leave your armaments at the door. Lest you forget, this sacred institution holds rational discourse in the highest; the implements of war are expressly forbidden."},{"name":"THEROSTRAGUIDE04440","text":"I suggest you make your way inside. The Forum takes a rather dim view of lateness."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"While I very much take issue with the Forum's approach to selecting whom to save and when, they're not wrong for wanting to minimize potential conflicts."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Fortunately, if this plan of ours actually works, the great exodus itself will become entirely unnecessary..."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"My affinity for espionage may have earned me the title of Archon, but I was completely unaware of the Forum's plans. There may have been clues here and there, had I been of a mind to look for them...but contemplating that possibility only serves to further wound my pride."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Not that anyone could have realistically surmised that their brilliant stratagem was to build a giant ship, fly to the moon─a still-larger vessel in truth─and use that to travel to another star. Even now, the whole idea seems positively absurd when spoken aloud."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Of late, I have seen no sign of the Loporrits..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"This being their first opportunity to experience the wonders of Sharlayan, the potential for misadventure is nigh infinite..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I'm a little vexed that we've yet to learn of the Forum's replacement for the Antitower, though I expect that in time, they'll share that too with us─and with Master Matoya, if they've any sense."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"The further we pursue the mysteries of the universe, the more I struggle to comprehend the fortuitous nature of time itself."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"We measure and quantify it based on observations of celestial bodies, such as the sun and moon, but from your account it is unclear whether the ancients viewed time in a similar manner..."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I mention this because while Venat knew the Final Days would reoccur at a defined point in the future, she presumably had no way of knowing exactly when."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Even so, the completion of the Forum's preparations to escape to the moon aligning so closely with the advent of the Final Days is surely no coincidence..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Perhaps if Midgardsormr were still alive─in the traditional sense, that is─he could have offered to help the vessel attain the necessary speeds."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Then again, there's no guarantee his contribution would make enough of a difference to matter."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Phew... I'll admit, bringing up the issue of the Forum's incomplete ark was more than a little daunting."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"They were, to their credit, quite open about the current state of affairs. What was even more surprising, though, was when they took Alphinaud up on his offer!"},{"name":"FOURCHENAULT","text":"Rest assured, I have every intention of honoring the Forum's decision."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Sorry about not letting the rest of you in on my plan. I was, admittedly, thinking on my feet for the most part."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But since we require both a means of communing with Hydaelyn and reaching Meteion..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...In the spur of the moment, I saw involving ourselves with the completion of the ark as a way to work towards both objectives simultaneously."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"However, we must first keep our end of the bargain by solving the problem of the aetherburner."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I'd like to think it is not a challenge beyond our combined expertise. Or at least the expertise of our extended circle of associates."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It might behoove us to learn how an aetherburner actually works before we attempt to improve it, though!"}],"reward":{"gil":1159},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":88,"id":142}],"quests":[69975]},"next":[69852,69853,69977]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1039681","obj":{"i":1039681,"n":"Lucia","l":3710,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1039693","obj":{"i":1039693,"n":"Alphinaud","l":3706,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69975","obj":{"i":69975,"n":"As the Heavens Burn","g":11,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":593}},{"type":"quest","id":"69852","obj":{"i":69852,"n":"For the Love of Pudding","g":119,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":7101}},{"type":"quest","id":"69853","obj":{"i":69853,"n":"Secret in the Box","g":119,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":7110}},{"type":"quest","id":"69977","obj":{"i":69977,"n":"Going Underground","g":11,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":595}}]}
