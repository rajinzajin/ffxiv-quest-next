My clothes have mostly dried, but they're a bit clingy. Still, no regrets!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I wonder─Lominsan pirates have been known to say things like, “Arrr,” but surely pirates on the opposite side of the world would use different expressions? “Errr,” or “Urrr,” or “Arururu,” perhaps?"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Doma's position on the Confederacy could be best described as one of “guarded acceptance.” They are pirates, aye, but they adhere to a code and are a stabilizing force in the Ruby Sea."},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"As he says, there is business to be discussed."},{"name":"TANSUI","text":"You wish to pay the Ruby Tithe, yes? With your...gil, perhaps? It is just as well. Foreign currencies are in demand these days."},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"I would pay for their passage to Othard."},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"Does this sum meet with your satisfaction?"},{"name":"TANSUI","text":"...The sea has been quite tempestuous of late. I cannot say with confidence that you would reach your destination safely─unless you tripled it."},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"D-Do you take me for a fool? I know the price, as do all!"},{"name":"TANSUI","text":"Alas, we live in interesting times. As you came from Kugane, I should think I need not tell you that."},{"name":"TANSUI","text":"The shadow of war looms. The wise and the cautious shirk our waters and our custom, and the foolhardy sharpen their knives in anticipation."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Meaning...?"},{"name":"TESHITAPIRATE","text":"Sir! Sir! You've got to come quickly. The bastards're at it again!"},{"name":"TESHITAPIRATE","text":"I tried to convince them to stop, but they weren't having it."},{"name":"TANSUI","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Very well. I will be there shortly."},{"name":"TANSUI","text":"...Hm. A proposition. Your comrades strike me as a worthwhile investment. I would not hear men name me a cat before koban, so I shall consider their tithe paid─not for what they have done, but for what I expect they will do."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I'm not sure what to make of that man, but at least the matter of our tithe is settled. For now."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"What was that he and the other pirate were talking about? Maybe we ought to go and have a look."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"That's Tansui over there, isn't it?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Do you know what this is all about?"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Hmm...I have been away for some time, so..."},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"I...I am not certain this is a wise idea..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"So they really don't care what happens to Doma? I can't...I refuse to believe that."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Doma is but one of many provinces under imperial control, filled with people who have had to find ways to cope with a bitter reality..."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"What are we waiting for? Come, come! Soroban cannot have gone far!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"...Though now that I think on it, it is passing strange that he left without warning. Mayhap he did not wish to be seen by his Kojin brethren?"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"I doubt he thought to leave us behind, but nevertheless, it may be prudent to return to his ship. Or at least to the Confederate encampment."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Oh good, he's still here!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I am sure he has his reasons for his odd behavior...and I should like very much to hear them. Trust requires honesty."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Hah! I told you he would not abandon us!"},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"Oh, my friends! A thousand pardons! ...As you may have guessed, I was reluctant to be seen in your company by my Red brothers. Ours is a...complex relationship."},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"I pray you do not misinterpret their actions as a reflection of our allegiances as a whole."},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"You...you understand? Kami be praised! Too often are shell-less quick to judge all Kojin for the deeds of one."},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"Right, then. Now that our business with Tansui is concluded, we can traverse the Ruby Sea without fear!"}],"reward":{"gil":762,"items":[{"id":18209,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18215,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18221,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18233,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5633,"one":1}],"xp":183600},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":62,"id":142}],"quests":[68013]},"next":[68015,68209,68210,68211,68212,68213,68214]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1019898","obj":{"i":1019898,"n":"Tansui","l":2409,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023650","obj":{"i":1023650,"n":"Soroban","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019899","obj":{"i":1019899,"n":"Lyse","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019900","obj":{"i":1019900,"n":"Alisaie","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019901","obj":{"i":1019901,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019902","obj":{"i":1019902,"n":"Soroban","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019903","obj":{"i":1019903,"n":"Lyse","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019904","obj":{"i":1019904,"n":"Alisaie","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019905","obj":{"i":1019905,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019906","obj":{"i":1019906,"n":"Soroban","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019912","obj":{"i":1019912,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019913","obj":{"i":1019913,"n":"Alisaie","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019914","obj":{"i":1019914,"n":"Lyse","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023647","obj":{"i":1023647,"n":"Lyse","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023648","obj":{"i":1023648,"n":"Alisaie","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023649","obj":{"i":1023649,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2409,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"18209","obj":{"i":18209,"n":"High Steel Sollerets of Fending","l":265,"c":47117,"t":38,"p":20778}},{"type":"item","id":"18215","obj":{"i":18215,"n":"High Steel Sollerets of Maiming","l":265,"c":47118,"t":38,"p":20778}},{"type":"item","id":"18221","obj":{"i":18221,"n":"Gyuki Leather Highboots of Striking","l":265,"c":46769,"t":38,"p":20778}},{"type":"item","id":"18233","obj":{"i":18233,"n":"Gyuki Leather Highboots of Scouting","l":265,"c":46770,"t":38,"p":20778}},{"type":"item","id":"5633","obj":{"i":5633,"n":"Piety Materia V","l":160,"c":20256,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Piety","category":0,"advancedMeldingForbidden":1}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68013","obj":{"i":68013,"n":"Open Water","g":6,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":320}},{"type":"quest","id":"68015","obj":{"i":68015,"n":"To Bend with the Wind","g":6,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":340}},{"type":"quest","id":"68209","obj":{"i":68209,"n":"The Price of Betrayal","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":2030,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68210","obj":{"i":68210,"n":"The Organ of Sight","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":2020}},{"type":"quest","id":"68211","obj":{"i":68211,"n":"The Devil's Cough","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":2010}},{"type":"quest","id":"68212","obj":{"i":68212,"n":"First Line of Defense","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":2040}},{"type":"quest","id":"68213","obj":{"i":68213,"n":"Ethereal Lights","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":2050}},{"type":"quest","id":"68214","obj":{"i":68214,"n":"Protector of the Small","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":2060}}]}
