May your passage be swift and your bearings sure."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"...Well, I daresay you have your reasons. But mark me: in stormy seas, the strong of arm and stout of heart must pull together or the vessel will founder. And when a ship goes down, the passengers <span class=\"emphasis\">always</span> share the fate of the crew. Remember that."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"Pray keep in mind that you are at liberty to transfer between Grand Companies.

You don't even have a uniform!"},{"name":"STORMLIEUTENANT","text":"Be at ease, sir. We are of the Maelstrom. You're a Garlond Ironworks engineer, yes?

Good work on reaching our friend here before the imperials."},{"name":"IMPERIALSOLDIER","text":"I've never seen a craft of this design... It must be Garlond's work.

They are not to be squandered on Eorzean savages!"},{"name":"IMPERIALSOLDIER","text":"We are taking this craft back to the fortress! Dismantle it if you must! And bring the engineer!
