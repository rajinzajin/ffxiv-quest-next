I knew the Alliance had spies in Gyr Abania, but in Radiata? Impressive..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...I suspect a handpicked contingent of the Ala Mhigan Brigade's finest would have been equally, if not more, qualified...but what do I know."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Perhaps you recall the night we first met outside the Sil'dihn ruins, under such unfortunate circumstances? I had just returned from a meeting with my Ala Mhigan agents. As I said before, we have been preparing for this day."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"We have lost so many men already... If we suffer another defeat like that, this campaign is over."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"We will have our retribution. It is but a matter of time."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Had Alphinaud not volunteered you, I would have asked. If anyone can see this mission through, it's you."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"We'll be fighting with the main host when the time comes to attack Castrum Abania. I swear by everything that is holy─we won't lose!"},{"name":"VMAHTIA","text":"There you go again, getting all worked up...though it could be worse. So long as you don't start saying bollocks like, “I'll never forgive them!” Makes for a terrible battle cry, you know?"},{"name":"JMOLDVA","text":"Many of the J tribe call this place home. I shudder to think what would become of them if we fail."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Thanks for standing by me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Together, we'll make Conrad proud!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"So, to review: we are to travel to Radiata, where we will meet with a contact recruited by Marshal Tarupin's agents."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I took the liberty of reviewing intelligence reports while <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and Lyse were away, so the settlement is not wholly unfamiliar to me..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"As the vice marshal indicated, the vast majority of the populace is employed as menial labor in either Specula Imperatoris or Castrum Abania. Perhaps as a result of this, the Resistance has long struggled to make inroads there."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"Aye, you have the right of it. They got a better deal than most Ala Mhigans─feeding off what scraps the imperials gave 'em. Damned if I know how Marshal Tarupin's agents got one of them to turn his coat."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I understand your disdain, I do. But I also understand their desire to look after their families by any means necessary..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Our contact is a Roegadyn woman. She will ask us a question. After we answer with “courage,” she will know us as friends."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"\"Courage.“ Right.<br>Put together a squadron, Naago. We'll need them soon."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"With me, my friends─and be ready for anything."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Keep an eye out, would you? Something doesn't feel right..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I know you're out there..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If there were magitek armor nearby, surely we would have heard them by now?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"See? What did I tell you? Let us continue on to Specula Imperatoris!"},{"name":"BALLOON","text":"Savages!?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Whew. That would have been an unceremonious ending to our tale."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Heh, nothing to it!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Of course there were still soldiers lurking about... Fortunately, they were no match for Lyse. Come─Radiata is not much further."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Of course, in light of our recent encounter, it would be prudent to proceed with caution and remain vigilant for imperial forces..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I thought they said this was a village? It looks more like a work camp..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Nary a soldier in sight. Mayhap they were recalled to Castrum Abania..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Looks like it's safe to enter. I don't see any imperials..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Hmm... I don't see smoke above Castrum Abania anymore. Do you think they fixed the cannon already...?"}],"reward":{"gil":667,"items":[{"id":18665,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18668,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18669,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18671,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5683,"one":1}],"xp":232200},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":142}],"quests":[68077]},"next":[68079]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1020629","obj":{"i":1020629,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022344","obj":{"i":1022344,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020408","obj":{"i":1020408,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020409","obj":{"i":1020409,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020410","obj":{"i":1020410,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020604","obj":{"i":1020604,"n":"Raubahn","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020609","obj":{"i":1020609,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020628","obj":{"i":1020628,"n":"M'naago","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020630","obj":{"i":1020630,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":6}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020631","obj":{"i":1020631,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020632","obj":{"i":1020632,"n":"Pipin","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020636","obj":{"i":1020636,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020637","obj":{"i":1020637,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020638","obj":{"i":1020638,"n":"Serpent Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020639","obj":{"i":1020639,"n":"Storm Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021616","obj":{"i":1021616,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021617","obj":{"i":1021617,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022339","obj":{"i":1022339,"n":"Arenvald","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022340","obj":{"i":1022340,"n":"V'mah Tia","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022341","obj":{"i":1022341,"n":"J'moldva","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022343","obj":{"i":1022343,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"18665","obj":{"i":18665,"n":"Zelkova Cane","l":285,"c":32713,"t":9,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18668","obj":{"i":18668,"n":"Gazelleskin Codex","l":285,"c":33232,"t":98,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18669","obj":{"i":18669,"n":"Palladium Planisphere","l":285,"c":34889,"t":89,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18671","obj":{"i":18671,"n":"Palladium Tuck","l":285,"c":36708,"t":97,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"5683","obj":{"i":5683,"n":"Battledance Materia V","l":160,"c":20256,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Tenacity","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68077","obj":{"i":68077,"n":"The Path Forward","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1010}},{"type":"quest","id":"68079","obj":{"i":68079,"n":"Where Courage Endures","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1030}}]}
