I need you to find them and see to their safety."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"The morbol was spotted to the east of here near Pike Falls, but they're certain to have fled. Nevertheless, I would ask you start your search there."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"See them back safely and our healers will handle the rest."},{"name":"SOLDIERA02640","text":"An...an adventurer...? Please, you have to help! The morbol, they...they drew it away to save me, but they're no match for such a beast."},{"name":"SOLDIERA02640","text":"They've gone to the bridge south of here. Go, before it's too late."},{"name":"SOLDIERA02640","text":"You needn't concern yourself with me. Go and save the others!"},{"name":"SOLDIERB02640","text":"The serpent marshal sent you? Oh, thank heavens. Any longer and we'd likely be in the morbol's belly. Felling such a fiend is beyond the likes of us, but perhaps you would be willing to carry on in our stead?"},{"name":"SOLDIERB02640","text":"Another of our comrades, Flame Sergeant Dodogun, has taken to high ground to better survey the area and provide us with information on our targets. Use this linkpearl to speak with him and track down the morbol."},{"name":"SOLDIERB02640","text":"I will see the others back to Castrum Oriens. We're counting on you─that beast cannot be suffered to remain in these lands."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Dodogun-)Hello? Who is this?<br>...The silent type, eh? Well, follow my instructions, and we'll see that overgrown weed is exterminated once and for all."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Dodogun-)It seems to be heading for the Striped Hills. It's fast, but I think I can keep an eye on it until you get there."},{"name":"SOLDIERB02640","text":"We're well enough to make it back to Castrum Oriens on our own. You must see to the morbol before anyone else comes to harm."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Dodogun-)The morbol should be right ahead. If I didn't know better I would swear you've tracked animals before."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Dodogun-)At any rate, there's nothing else I can do from here. It's up to you now to put an end to things. Good luck."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Dodogun-)Do you see anything? It was there just a moment ago."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Dodogun-)Wait! It's over there, to the east!"},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Dodogun-)Wait! It's over there, to the north!"},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"Oh! So you were on the other end of the linkpearl. Well, you won't slay any morbols standing around up here with me. Get down there and find it!"},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"You didn't need to come up here and tell me what happened. I saw the whole thing. Serpent Marshal Brookstone, on the other hand, likely hasn't heard the news yet."},{"name":"POP","text":"You are under attack!"},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"Excellent work. Thanks to you, we were able to keep casualties to a minimum."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"As Flame Sergeant Dodogun tells it, you are every bit the adventurer they say. It's not often anyone can elicit praise from him."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"In fact, he's offered to buy you a drink when he next returns to Castrum Oriens."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"On behalf of all the soldiers here, you have my sincerest thanks. We're quite fortunate to have one such as you among our ranks."}],"reward":{"gil":745,"items":[{"id":18096,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18097,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18098,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5673,"one":1}],"xp":83700},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":34}],"quests":[67988]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1019519","obj":{"i":1019519,"n":"Serpent Marshal Brookstone","l":2406,"q":8}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019529","obj":{"i":1019529,"n":"Dodogun","l":2406,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022059","obj":{"i":1022059,"n":"Flame Recruit","l":2406,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022060","obj":{"i":1022060,"n":"Serpent Recruit","l":2406,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"18096","obj":{"i":18096,"n":"Triphane Choker of Fending","l":255,"c":54812,"t":40,"p":15147}},{"type":"item","id":"18097","obj":{"i":18097,"n":"Triphane Choker of Slaying","l":255,"c":54812,"t":40,"p":15147}},{"type":"item","id":"18098","obj":{"i":18098,"n":"Triphane Choker of Aiming","l":255,"c":54812,"t":40,"p":15147}},{"type":"item","id":"5673","obj":{"i":5673,"n":"Savage Aim Materia V","l":160,"c":20258,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Critical Hit","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"67988","obj":{"i":67988,"n":"Signed, Sealed, to Be Delivered","g":6,"l":"The Fringes","s":70}}]}
