Having furnished you with the crystal shoes, Seto wishes you well on your mission, and you depart at once for Lyhe Ghiah, where the Lightwarden awaits...","At the arrival of the bearer of all four relics, the seal protecting the castle is broken. All that remains is to venture inside and confront the Light-corrupted king of the faeries, Titania.<br><br>※The Dancing Plague can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","At the end of a frenzied struggle, you emerge victorious over the Lightwarden, thereby restoring night to Il Mheg.","Joining you inside Lyhe Ghiah, Feo Ul declares that, by the laws of Il Mheg, you should rightly take your defeated foe's place as king. Before you can ponder a life spent frolicking with the faeries, however, your beautiful branch shoulders this burden in your stead. Thus empowered, the pixie leads an army to Lydha Lran and repels the invading Eulmoran forces. Though your struggles are far from over, the day─or rather, the night─is yours.","Beneath a benevolent blanket of stars, Urianger congratulates you on your victory. With the Lightwarden's defeat, you are one step closer to accomplishing your goal, and under their new ruler, it is not impossible that the faeries may one day prove useful allies...assuming, of course, they feel like it."],"objectives":["Investigate the castle gate.","Confront Titania in the Dancing Plague.","Speak with Urianger."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SETO","text":"Forgive me, it seems my indecision has cost you precious time."},{"name":"SETO","text":"But I am convinced now.
