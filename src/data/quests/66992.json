Though the realm is not yet free of strife, the Antecedent stresses that your deeds inspire countless Eorzeans to continue along the difficult road to peace. Conscious that you cannot be expected to spend your every waking moment attending to realm-shaking matters, however, she encourages you to stay awhile in Revenant's Toll. Just when it seems as if you have been granted leave to rest, Minfilia asks that you spare a moment to indulge the attention of the Doman children. Speak with Yozan within the Rising Stones.","Elated to see you returned to Revenant's Toll, Yozan and his fellow “Doman adventurers” beg you to give them a special training session. Hoary Boulder, the Roegadyn who has taken charge of the children's daily instruction, instead proposes a sparring match between you and himself. Head to the east of Revenant's Toll and speak with Hoary Boulder to signify your readiness to begin the demonstration of martial skill.","You have bested Hoary Boulder in the sparring match. The gathered onlookers cheer your victory, and praise your hard-won strength. Following the bout, Alphinaud approaches you and asks that you meet with him to discuss the future of Eorzea. Head to the Rising Stones and speak with the young Elezen.","You return to the Rising Stones, and Alphinaud outlines his proposal to form a new organization.

I don't think I want to see anyone else being hurt..."},{"name":"SHIUN","text":"We had a Master of Lessons back in Doma, and the way he taught us was very different from Mister Boulder.

I trust you are ready to begin?"},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"Very well. Let us not keep the younglings waiting any longer!"},{"name":"COULTENET","text":"Ahem. Hoary?

Without <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> to inspire my efforts, I would not be half the warrior I am today."},{"name":"COULTENET","text":"Your point is well made. But remember: this is for the children's sake as well as your own. Should it appear the contest will end too swiftly, I shall add my spells to your bladework."},{"name":"YDA","text":"(-???-)Hello! You haven't begun yet, have you?"},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"Yda!? What─ Who are all these people!?"},{"name":"YDA","text":"When I heard about your sparring match, I told everyone I could find. Thought you could use a crowd to cheer you on!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Yes, and there are still more to come. When I mentioned <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s name, the reaction was quite enthusiastic."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Why, my own popularity seems but a sickly shade in comparison! You'd best claim victory, Bringer of Light─your burgeoning reputation is at stake!"},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"Well, our teacher won't be beaten so easily! He's a master swordsman!"},{"name":"KOHARU","text":"You can win, Mister Boulder!"},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"We shall soon see.

None can defeat the guardian of Eorzea!"},{"name":"SPECTATORWOMAN1456","text":"Now I see why they send you to deal with the primals! I've much work to do if I'm ever to attempt the same..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Impressive as always, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. 'Tis ever a pleasure to witness the spectacle of your martial prowess."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And judging by the smiles on these many faces, they, too, appreciate the hard-won strength that keeps the perils of the realm at bay."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"“Guardian of Eorzea”... Yes, that is a most fitting title."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Do you recall when first we met? 'Twas at the memorial service for the Battle of Carteneau..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"At the time, I was yet attempting to understand this land of Eorzea. I sought to grasp the reason why Grandfather willingly sacrificed himself to protect it."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I shall speak plainly: my initial impressions were less than favorable. Dire problems abounded, and yet the effort I saw expended towards their solution was haphazard and half-hearted. I thought Eorzeans a foolish and childish people."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Considering the shambles their home was in, I would not have been surprised if some had chosen to swear allegiance to Gaius and the order he proposed to enforce. The legatus's single-minded military invasion precluded any such switching of loyalties, of course."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Were it not for a desire to continue Grandfather's legacy, I would have abandoned the realm to its fate long ago. The threats were too many, the nations too self-involved and unstable."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"'Twas you who convinced me the salvation of Eorzea was possible."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"'Twas you who taught me─through countless acts of bravery─that what my grandsire sought to preserve was not the land, nor its history, nor any single nation..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It was the people. These wonderful, oft infuriating, stubborn people that suffer blow after terrible blow only to drag themselves back to their feet to face another day."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Though he never put such feelings into words, I believe Grandfather's admiration for this inextinguishable courage grew into a fervent wish─a wish to aid Eorzea and its inhabitants in charting a course for the future."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"A wish that has now become my own."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I, too, will endeavor to take up the mantle of guardian of Eorzea, and champion these people who toil towards a better world."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Our cause, however, is not a simple one: the troubles that plague us are of a scale that cannot be solved by the Scions of the Seventh Dawn alone."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"No, what is needed to tackle the root of the primal threat─and effectively counter the schemes of the Ascians─is a new, expanded organization that operates beyond the limitations of nations and borders."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If you would aid me in building such an organization, then pray let us continue this discussion back within the walls of the Rising Stones."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Thank you for coming, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. The world shifts and alters, and we, my friend, must ever be one step ahead of the chaos."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"What I propose is the formation of a new organization─a group that shall pave the way for a truly united Eorzea..."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"With the primal threat presently subdued, now is the perfect time to focus on new endeavors."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Alphinaud has long been laying the groundwork for this organization of his, and he looks to you to help turn his proposal into reality. Pray lend him what aid you can."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Your bout with Hoary Boulder was more stirring than a hundred lines of my most passionate poetry. Mayhaps I should arrange a sparring match of my own..."},{"name":"YDA","text":"I can't wait for Alphinaud to start his new company. I love making new friends!"},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"I wish Yda were not so eager to look to the future when we have so many problems in the here and now..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I fear Yda's boundless optimism is beginning to affect my better judgment. And your tendency to triumph against the most terrible of foes is certainly not helping matters."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"No, this won't do at all! And then I'll have to─ Oh, hello, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! If you don't mind, I'm terribly busy at the moment!"},{"name":"FLHAMINN","text":"'Tis not enough that I am here for my daughter─I must do what little I can to help you all succeed in your monumental tasks."},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I must thank you again for agreeing to our bout."},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"...And I must thank the gods 'twas not a duel to the death! I will, however, cherish the lesson of each scrape and bruise as I work to better my swordplay."},{"name":"COULTENET","text":"I thought the idea foolish at first, but it seems that sparring match well served its purpose. Why, I can hardly wait to return to my studies and seek to improve upon my technique!"},{"name":"HOUZAN","text":"My people's spirits were thoroughly crushed by the loss of our homeland, but thanks to your courage and generosity I see their inner flames once more flicker back to life. I, too, have felt my strength of will make a gradual return."},{"name":"DOUWARE","text":"Our Doman farming methods have been adopted here on the frontier. 'Tis too early yet to know if they will prove to be effective..."},{"name":"HIGIRI","text":"This place has become as a hive, and its bees flit about in constant motion. Perhaps a soothing pot of tea will coax one or two to alight and take a moment's rest."},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"Mister Boulder fought well, but he was no match for you, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">Mister</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"Just you wait! One day I'll be good enough to knock you from the top of your mountain!"},{"name":"KOHARU","text":"Mister Boulder is sore and beaten, but he said he'd return straight to his training. Heh heh, I don't think he likes to lose!"},{"name":"SHIUN","text":"We need to decide who in our Adventurers' Guild will do what. I'm fairly sure Yozan will have to be the swordfighter─he always has to be in the thick of the action."},{"name":"ROKKA","text":"I like the way Mister Coultenet fought─no swords or fists. I wonder, if I studied hard, would I be able to cast spells like that too?"},{"name":"QIB","text":"Win the sparring match!"},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"Day and night I've honed my skills.<br>Now comes the time to test them!"},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"Ugh... Such power!<br>The tales barely do you justice!"},{"name":"ROKKA","text":"Mister Boulder won't lose, will he?"},{"name":"SHIUN","text":"It's not over yet! It can't be!"},{"name":"COULTENET","text":"Aye, the children have the right of it."},{"name":"COULTENET","text":"'Tis time I joined the fray.<br>On your feet, Hoary!"},{"name":"KOHARU","text":"Oh no! He looks hurt..."},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">Mister</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> is so strong...<br>But you can't give up, Mister Boulder!"},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"Can't...disappoint...the younglings...<br>Raaargh!"},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"Never have I faced such strength!<br>...But the lesson must continue!"},{"name":"HOARYBOULDER","text":"'Tis your example I follow!<br>Surrender not to the implacable foe!"},{"name":"COULTENET","text":"I must admit defeat.<br>'Twas an honor and a privilege..."}],"reward":{"gil":1220,"items":[{"id":5677,"one":1},{"id":5682,"one":1},{"id":5717,"one":1}],"xp":4800},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":50,"id":142}],"quests":[66989]},"next":[66993]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1008969","obj":{"i":1008969,"n":"Minfilia","l":481,"q":19}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009021","obj":{"i":1009021,"n":"Alphinaud","l":481,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008980","obj":{"i":1008980,"n":"Yozan","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008993","obj":{"i":1008993,"n":"Thancred","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008994","obj":{"i":1008994,"n":"Yda","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008995","obj":{"i":1008995,"n":"Papalymo","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008996","obj":{"i":1008996,"n":"Y'shtola","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008997","obj":{"i":1008997,"n":"Tataru","l":481,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008998","obj":{"i":1008998,"n":"F'lhaminn","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008999","obj":{"i":1008999,"n":"Hoary Boulder","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009000","obj":{"i":1009000,"n":"Coultenet","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009001","obj":{"i":1009001,"n":"Hozan","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009002","obj":{"i":1009002,"n":"Doware","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009003","obj":{"i":1009003,"n":"Higiri","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009004","obj":{"i":1009004,"n":"Yozan","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009005","obj":{"i":1009005,"n":"Koharu","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009006","obj":{"i":1009006,"n":"Shiun","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009007","obj":{"i":1009007,"n":"Rokka","l":481,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009282","obj":{"i":1009282,"n":"Hoary Boulder","l":67,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009283","obj":{"i":1009283,"n":"Coultenet","l":67,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009284","obj":{"i":1009284,"n":"Yozan","l":67,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009285","obj":{"i":1009285,"n":"Koharu","l":67,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009286","obj":{"i":1009286,"n":"Shiun","l":67,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009287","obj":{"i":1009287,"n":"Rokka","l":67,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"5677","obj":{"i":5677,"n":"Savage Might Materia IV","l":70,"c":20224,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":3,"value":4,"attr":"Determination","category":0}}},{"type":"item","id":"5682","obj":{"i":5682,"n":"Battledance Materia IV","l":70,"c":20216,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":3,"value":4,"attr":"Tenacity","category":0}}},{"type":"item","id":"5717","obj":{"i":5717,"n":"Quickarm Materia IV","l":70,"c":20228,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":3,"value":4,"attr":"Skill Speed","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"66989","obj":{"i":66989,"n":"What Little Gods Are Made Of","g":2,"l":"East Shroud","s":50}},{"type":"quest","id":"66993","obj":{"i":66993,"n":"Recruiting the Realm","g":2,"l":"The Rising Stones","s":54}}]}
