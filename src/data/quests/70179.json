The industrious Lalafell offers you an unanticipated, but not unwelcome, gift─your own private island in the Cieldalaes. You can hardly say no to that, can you?","You make your way to the Moraby Drydocks and acquaint yourself with Baldin, a pirate-turned-ferry skipper, ere Tataru arrives dressed in her finest summer wear. With preparations now in order, you need only say the word to be whisked away to your island sanctuary.","After a journey south across cerulean seas, your ship arrives safely at the unnamed island that is to be your haven. Neither you nor Tataru waste time in disembarking to skip across the sands.","Tataru's high spirits are contagious as ever, and you cannot help but smile at her sheer jubilation. After offering a brief background of the isle, she mentions having procured assistance in the monumental task of making the island habitable through the use of local resources alone─though you must follow her further inland to discover the who and the how of it.","Tataru introduces you to the felicitous furball─the latest, though perhaps not greatest, in Sharlayan mammet technology. Despite the questionable nature of your new ally, Tataru's impassioned speech emboldens you to journey onward into a paradise all your own.
