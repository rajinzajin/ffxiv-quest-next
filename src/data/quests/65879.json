Minfilia bids you take part in the operation as the Scions' representative. Head for Camp Drybone and assemble with the Flames.","You have been briefed on the details of the operation. The Flames anticipate that the Amalj'aa will offer fierce resistance, and you are urged to prepare accordingly. When you are ready, proceed to the Invisible City, and lie in wait at the designated location.","Mere moments after surrounding the enemy, you learn that there is a traitor in the ranks, and are swiftly subdued. After an indeterminate amount of time, you awake to find yourself imprisoned within an Amalj'aa stronghold, along with the Flames. Speak with them to ascertain the situation.","It appears the Amalj'aa mean to make an offering of you and your companions to their primal, Ifrit. If it must end, let it be with weapon in hand. Wait for the right moment, and strike back at the beastmen.<br><br>※Challenge the Bowl of Embers with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the trial's entrance point.","It would appear that Ifrit has the power to bind mortals to his will, but for reasons yet unknown you are immune to his influence. Having failed to make you his minion, Ifrit elects to exterminate you instead, only to find himself outmatched. Quite how you found the strength to resist the godlike being is a question for another time. For now, make your way back to Camp Drybone, and speak with Thancred.","Having lavished you with praise, Thancred takes his leave to return to the Waking Sands. Minfilia will be eager to hear back from you as well. Report to her at the earliest opportunity.","At the Waking Sands, Minfilia and Thancred take turns bombarding you with information, explaining to you how the crystal robbery and the abductions served to advance Ifrit's cause. Thancred then reveals a disturbing truth: in order to prevent the primal from gaining strength, his “tempered” victims must be put to death. Though this revelation casts a grim shadow over your victory, you find yourself more determined than ever to play your part as a Scion."],"objectives":["Report to the flame sergeant at Camp Drybone.","Lie in wait at the Invisible City.","Speak with the flame sergeant.","Confront Ifrit in the Bowl of Embers.","Speak with Thancred at Camp Drybone.","Report to the Scion of the Seventh Dawn at the Waking Sands.","Defeat the Amalj'aa!"],"dialogue":[{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Word has arrived from Thancred concerning our ongoing investigation."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"It appears he was able to extract some information from our friend Ungust, the false priest."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"He revealed that he is due to meet with the Amalj'aa to discuss their dealings."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"The Immortal Flames believe that the meeting will present an ideal opportunity to ambush and capture the Amalj'aa responsible for the abductions, and so they mean to have Ungust attend as planned."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"As the Amalj'aa are anticipated to offer fierce resistance, the Immortal Flames have requested our support."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"I would have you provide it to them, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

Ifrit is slain, and by <span class=\"emphasis\">your</span> hand, no less!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"That is the deed of no ordinary individual, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Not that I ever thought you were ordinary. On the contrary, I have long suspected that you have the potential to shape the fate of this realm. What can I say? My fine eye for talent remains undimmed."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Minfilia will be proud beyond all reckoning when she hears of your deeds. I trust you shan't object to my bearing the tidings to her.

It is so good to see you again!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Impeccable timing, my friend. I had just finished regaling Minfilia with your heroic exploits."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Thancred has told me everything. You have done well to return to us."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"The perils you faced were undeniably great, yet a part of me believes that I had no cause to fear. And now we can put paid to our long investigation."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"As we suspected, the Amalj'aa undertook both the robbery and the abductions with the aim of summoning their primal, Ifrit."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Nor is this tale limited to Ul'dah. Similar incidents have been rife in both Limsa Lominsa and Gridania of late."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I daresay you've been curious as to how these crimes are linked to the primals. Permit me to explain."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Having manifested in the physical realm, primals must consume aether if they are to maintain their presence here. And the stronger they become, the more aether they require."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Now, aether exists throughout creation. It flows through all life, and permeates the very air that we breathe."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Alas, this alone will not suffice to sustain the likes of Ifrit. Nay, he and his kind require a more concentrated source of aether─crystals."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"It is for this reason that incidents involving crystals can often be traced back to a primal."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Which leaves us with the why of the abductions. To understand this, you must first understand how primals are born."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"When all is well with the world, primals possess no physical form. Their essence is dispersed across the great river of aether."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"However, when the world is plunged into chaos, those who worship the primals cry out to their gods for deliverance from suffering."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"These cries serve as a beacon toward which a primal's essence is irresistibly drawn. It is this coming together─or “aetheric coalescence”─which grants the beings physical form."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Once born, a primal gains strength from its followers' worship. The more numerous and fervent they are, the more powerful their god becomes."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"But the primals are seldom satisfied with such reverence as their adherents freely give, and in order to gain more power, they do not scruple to <span class=\"emphasis\">create</span> followers. They do this by “tempering” mortals─a process to which you yourself were subjected."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Yet even as Ifrit took your comrades in his thrall, you alone remained unaffected. This is thanks to the power you possess─the Echo."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"We know not the why of it, but those blessed with the Echo are immune to primal influence."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"It is as though a greater power protects us..."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"When first you came to us, I told you that the Echo would be instrumental in dealing with the primal threat. I trust you now begin to see why."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"The recent incidents all share a common trait: meticulous planning. Such elaborate designs are a new development, and one which fills me with an unshakable sense of foreboding."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"While I share your concern, my presiding feeling is one of relief at your safe return."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Ah, the Immortal Flames assured me that they will deal with the aftermath, so you need not concern yourself with that. We may rest easy for a time."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"I suggest you take full advantage of the respite, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"You may be sure it won't last long. Once the people learn the identity of the hero who felled Ifrit, I fear you will have nary a moment to yourself!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Whether she intended to or no, Minfilia neglected to tell you something─something I think it would be best you heard from one of us."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"It concerns the tempered abductees that were rescued... I am sorry to report that all are to be put to death, the Flames with whom you were imprisoned included. Needless to say, this information must not be made known to the public."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I swear to you that we would not do this if there were any other recourse─but once a man is tempered, he is tempered for life. His very existence lends strength to the primal whom he cannot choose but worship."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"And so we Scions continue our fight, that no more innocents need be sacrificed. I hope that you will continue to stand with us, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"But I should be going. I must offer my apologies to the Flame General for the losses his people suffered. Till next time!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Gods forgive me... How many more lives...?
