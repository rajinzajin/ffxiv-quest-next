We rice farmers consider our paddies as children. They certainly require just as much attention."},{"name":"HONAMI","text":"There is rarely a day we do not worry about pests or something else that might do our fields harm. If you would like to know more about life in our village, why don't you try helping us tend to our paddies?"},{"name":"HONAMI","text":"Speak with my husband, Ageta. I know he will be glad for any help he can get!"},{"name":"HONAMI","text":"Speak with my husband, Ageta. I know he will be glad for any help he can get!"},{"name":"AGETA","text":"You would like to help me tend my fields? That sounds fantastic to me! There aren't too many young folk left in the village and rice farming is hard work, let me tell you."},{"name":"AGETA","text":"Firstly, I would have you remove the arrowheads from my fields. It is a pesky weed that inhibits the growth of rice plants. Come speak with me again once you are done."},{"name":"AGETA","text":"Speak with me again once you are done plucking the arrowheads from my fields."},{"name":"HONAMI","text":"It feels good to do some work in the fields once in a while, doesn't it?"},{"name":"AGETA","text":"I see you have worked up quite a sweat! Thanks for helping. “Namai” is actually a local term for the arrowhead─it does make you wonder just who thought naming a village after a weed was a good idea."},{"name":"AGETA","text":"Next we need to deal with any pests that lurk in the paddies. Although, it will not be your job per se─we shall use the house sparrows I have trained for the task."},{"name":"AGETA","text":"I keep them in this birdcage. Please set them free near my paddy fields."},{"name":"AGETA","text":"Once they have all flown from the cage, <span class=\"highlight\">clap</span> your hands. I have trained them to recognize that as their signal to begin working."},{"name":"AGETA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Clap</span> your hands once all the sparrows have flown from the cage."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Clap</span> near the sparrows to get them to start searching for pests."},{"name":"AGETA","text":"Thank you so much for all your help! I will not be needing to worry about pests for the time being."},{"name":"AGETA","text":"I have told my wife to give you some compensation for your troubles.

I do hope the work was not too hard on you."},{"name":"HONAMI","text":"It is not an easy job, but the sense of satisfaction when you are able to taste the very rice you have reaped...words do not do the sensation justice."},{"name":"HONAMI","text":"Harvest is still a long way off, but we are ready to put the work in. All we need is a little help from the weather and things will be fine.
