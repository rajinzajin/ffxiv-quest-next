That is well, for I wish to unburden myself."},{"name":"LEWENA","text":"I've been having a frustrating time with the Fashion Report, the challenge they recently introduced. Yes, I, who can play any game here blindfolded and spun around, struggle with it. To be fair to myself, though, it has a subjective element."},{"name":"LEWENA","text":"If you have a mind for fashion, perhaps you would like to try your hand at the challenge.
