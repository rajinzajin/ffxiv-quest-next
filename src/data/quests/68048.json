With me!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Such contempt as was in their eyes I have never known... But for the soul to live on as they say is not something I can so easily accept."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Do they truly believe this? All of them? That in death there can be rebirth? ...Retribution?"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"...In any event, we came here in search of information. We cannot leave without speaking with her people."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Err...that is to say, then, that death is essentially meaningless?"},{"name":"KOKO","text":"I know you! Reunion!

That would be because it is."},{"name":"KOKO","text":"I died a woman and was reborn a man.

Many look only to the name and the flesh, and let these things dictate their perceptions."},{"name":"KOKO","text":"Consider Sadu Khatun. Three times before she died a man, yet she returns as a woman the fourth. Yet she is no less fierce, and any outsider foolish enough to think so will learn the truth to their peril."},{"name":"KOKO","text":"Is the khatun woman or man? A stupid question. She is Sadu."},{"name":"QOYAR","text":"The cycle of death and rebirth? It is simply that. Take me─I died in battle with the Hotgo. Fiercely did I fight, and so I returned."},{"name":"QOYAR","text":"Alas, we know naught of our past lives. I must learn what it means to be Qoyar again and again. It is difficult to remember everything, but important."},{"name":"QOYAR","text":"It filled me with such excitement when they first told me of my deeds, as did my friends!"},{"name":"MERGEN","text":"Impressive, is it not? 'Twas slain by my boy."},{"name":"MERGEN","text":"We were childhood friends, he and I, before he fell and returned. A master of the bow. It is good to see that he retains his skill."},{"name":"MERGEN","text":"We competed against one another in the hunts. Though I knew he would return, I never expected it to be as my son!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. You have completed your inquiries?"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Aye, it is as she said. They believe with every fiber of their being that their bravest warriors will be reborn."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"As for me, I observed some of their warriors at practice. They are as formidable as the Oronir, perhaps more, and their weapons are their equal as well."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Yet while they do not lack in skill and resources, 'tis plain to see that their numbers are inferior..."}],"reward":{"gil":865,"items":[{"id":18521,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18527,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18533,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18545,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5633,"one":1}],"xp":216000},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":66,"id":142}],"quests":[68047]},"next":[68049,68322,68323,68324,68325,68326,68327,68328,68329,68330,68331,68332,68333,68334]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1021625","obj":{"i":1021625,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2411,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021615","obj":{"i":1021615,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2411,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019320","obj":{"i":1019320,"n":"Koko","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019321","obj":{"i":1019321,"n":"Mergen","l":2411,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019322","obj":{"i":1019322,"n":"Qoyar","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021608","obj":{"i":1021608,"n":"Wounded Hunter","l":2411,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021611","obj":{"i":1021611,"n":"Sadu","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021613","obj":{"i":1021613,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"18521","obj":{"i":18521,"n":"Doman Steel Greaves of Fending","l":279,"c":47119,"t":38,"p":21641}},{"type":"item","id":"18527","obj":{"i":18527,"n":"Doman Steel Greaves of Maiming","l":279,"c":47122,"t":38,"p":21641}},{"type":"item","id":"18533","obj":{"i":18533,"n":"Doman Steel Greaves of Striking","l":279,"c":47120,"t":38,"p":21641}},{"type":"item","id":"18545","obj":{"i":18545,"n":"Doman Steel Greaves of Scouting","l":279,"c":47121,"t":38,"p":21641}},{"type":"item","id":"5633","obj":{"i":5633,"n":"Piety Materia V","l":160,"c":20256,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Piety","category":0,"advancedMeldingForbidden":1}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68047","obj":{"i":68047,"n":"Sworn Enemies of the Sun","g":6,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":690}},{"type":"quest","id":"68049","obj":{"i":68049,"n":"A Final Peace","g":6,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":710}},{"type":"quest","id":"68322","obj":{"i":68322,"n":"Welcome to the Family","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6080}},{"type":"quest","id":"68323","obj":{"i":68323,"n":"Brainy Bears","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6090}},{"type":"quest","id":"68324","obj":{"i":68324,"n":"Child's Play","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6100}},{"type":"quest","id":"68325","obj":{"i":68325,"n":"Dastardly Diremites","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6110}},{"type":"quest","id":"68326","obj":{"i":68326,"n":"Nhaama's Sweet Embrace","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6120}},{"type":"quest","id":"68327","obj":{"i":68327,"n":"Mauci of the Seven Worries","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6130,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68328","obj":{"i":68328,"n":"Watch and Learn","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6140}},{"type":"quest","id":"68329","obj":{"i":68329,"n":"The Power of the Fist","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6150}},{"type":"quest","id":"68330","obj":{"i":68330,"n":"Do or Die","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6160}},{"type":"quest","id":"68331","obj":{"i":68331,"n":"Hungry Like the Wolf","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6170}},{"type":"quest","id":"68332","obj":{"i":68332,"n":"Ibakha Dreams of Birds","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6180}},{"type":"quest","id":"68333","obj":{"i":68333,"n":"The Melody of Ceol Aen","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6190}},{"type":"quest","id":"68334","obj":{"i":68334,"n":"Food Glorious Food","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":6200}}]}
