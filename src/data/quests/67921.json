Putting on his bravest face, he boldly states his intention to strike out for Azys Lla, going as far as to challenge Ohl Deeh to a race to the floating isle. You follow in pursuit, knowing that your presence will undoubtedly be needed to ensure that the two do not end up biting off more than they can chew.","You arrive at Azys Lla to find a dejected Ohl Deeh in utter disbelief that his wings proved less swift than those of the deftarm's kongamato. Vowing to get his revenge in a few short centuries, he quickly puts the minor disgrace behind him and declares that he will use his influence to glean information regarding Gullinbursti's whereabouts. With a healthy degree of skepticism as to how successful this approach will be, you set off after him.","You arrive in Azys Lla to find Ohl Deeh discouraged that the dragons of this land have proven entirely uncooperative in imparting any information that could guide your party to Gullinbursti. In response to his query, you mention the name of Tiamat, and the impertinent dragonet is all too eager to cast any semblance of tact and decency to the wind in interrupting the ancient dragon's eternal suffering to inquire as to his friend's whereabouts. Somewhat reluctantly, you go along, hoping that your presence will keep Ohl Deeh from saying anything overly stupid.","Ohl Deeh's cavalier disposition toward the eternally tormented Tiamat notwithstanding, your visit proves a fruitful one, as Bahamut's brood-sister enlightens you as to Gullinbursti's current whereabouts, while also hinting at a possible means to free the tortured dragon from the madness that has seized him. With Ohl Deeh and the deftarm at your side, you set off to the northeast, where the young dragonet hopes to summon a mighty roar that will reach his friend's ears and heart.","In the Beta Quadrant, you come upon an incapacitated Gullinbursti being watched over by the nefarious Nhaza'a Jaab and his client, a low-ranking imperial officer by the name of Drusus mal Soranus, who─it is revealed─has furnished the mercenary with the Allagan devices he has employed to wreak his particular brand of havoc. The peevish Drusus summarily orders his hired gun to eliminate the intruders─namely, you and your friends─but Nhaza'a Jaab coolly refuses, and instead sics Gullinbursti on his employer, reducing him to a charred husk. The masked Miqo'te then sets Gullinbursti on the deftarm, but a well-timed appearance by Mogzin's mannequin distracts the dragon, affording Ohl Deeh enough time to unleash a roar far mightier than any would expect from his tiny frame─a roar which breaks the spell over Gullinbursti, at long last restoring him to his gentle self. Nhaza'a Jaab draws his gun and takes aim, but is swiftly disarmed by a timely shot from the deftarm, who is all too eager to return the favor from their encounter at Voor Sian Siran. The mercenary attempts to retreat, but is headed off by Linu Vali and her fellow Gundu, who had made the momentous decision to flaunt tradition to stand by your side in this final confrontation. Nhaza'a Jaab manages to frantically escape to his manacutter and appears to have gotten away, when another unerring shot from the deftarm strikes true, sending the vessel hurtling down through the clouds. Your job complete, you and your friends are free to return home, with a promise to sojourn in Ok' Gundu Nakki on the way, that you might celebrate your triumph this day.","Back in Ok' Gundu Nakki, the Gundu hold a great feast to celebrate your triumph and safe return. Together with Linu Vali, you unveil the moonlift dance in public for the first time, and encourage your beastman companions to join in the revelry. The motions prove so infectious that all present are soon moving as one, and together you dance the night away. Through your efforts, dragon, man, moogle, Vath, and Vanu Vanu alike stand in staunch solidarity, and the hearts of all are filled with hope that the bonds forged this day will continue to bear fruit for years to come."],"objectives":["Speak with the deftarm at Helix.","Speak with Ohl Deeh.","Seek out Tiamat.","Rendezvous with the deftarm.","Speak with Linu Vali at Ok' Gundu Nakki."],"dialogue":[{"name":"OHLDEEH","text":"Say it is not so!

This land may be unfamiliar to you, but not to me and my kind! Yes, I can feel the presence of mighty dragons all around us!"},{"name":"OHLDEEH","text":"We need only stop one and ask politely if they have seen aught of Gullinbursti.

Yes, I daresay you are!"},{"name":"UDEKIKI","text":"&lt;click&gt; &lt;click&gt; The dragons in these parts are unobliging. Very unobliging.

It inspires me to strive for the same."},{"name":"COLORDRAGON","text":"And you, Ohl Deeh. 'Twould seem it was your roar that freed me from my madness. You have grown strong, and in so short a span.
