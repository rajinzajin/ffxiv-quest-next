Following their estimated route across the desert, Jamial leads the way west towards the Nabaath Severance, where the last excavation point is situated.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Ghun Gun's fervent scrabbling reveals a cylindrical container beneath the sand. He turns to offer the relic to Jamial, only to discover that your elderly companion has mysteriously disappeared.","Despite being in the midst of a vast, open desert, Jamial is nowhere to be seen. Ghun Gun suggests looking from a higher vantage point while he stays behind to guard the treasure.","Jamial's trail has gone cold, the desert winds having blown away any footprints he may have left. With no other recourse, you return to Ghun Gun to share these ill tidings.","While you were searching for your missing companion, Ghun Gun has been inspecting the treasure he had found earlier, which contained a Nabaath royal family tree. One name in particular stands out among the list of monarchs: Jamial. Ghun Gun, never one to let logic cloud his judgment, jumps to the conclusion that the elderly man with whom you have been traveling must therefore be a ghost of a dead malik, who, satisfied by the discovery of the lost relics, has now passed on to the afterlife, hence his sudden disappearance. Believing that ghosts are plaguing Amh Araeng, he asks that you go with him and report the matter to his father.","In the midst of explaining your findings to Ghen Gen, you are interrupted by the arrival of Jamial, who is in fact not a ghost after all, much to the surprise of Ghun Gun. The elderly archaeologist reveals that he was named after his grandfather, Jamial IX, the last malik of the Nabaath, and that he wishes to recover their treasures. Ghun Gun is also eager to learn more of his own people's past, and expresses his desire to assist Jamial in further expeditions. As the pair leave to discuss their next outing, Ghen Gen thanks you in their stead for your contributions towards discovering the lost history of Amh Araeng."],"objectives":["Search for buried artifacts at the designated location.","Speak with Ghun Gun.","Search for Jamial at the designated location.","Report to Ghun Gun.","Speak with Ghun Gun in Mord Souq."],"dialogue":[{"name":"JAMIAL","text":"There is one last place I wish to visit."},{"name":"GHUNGUN","text":"I want to dig, dig, dig!
