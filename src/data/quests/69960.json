Consider yourself privileged─and behave accordingly."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Though I see new creations on a daily basis, here they look at them with a different eye. It will be interesting to observe Hermes at work."},{"name":"METEION","text":"This time we <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> get to go for a walk! Isn't it exciting?"},{"name":"HERMES","text":"If everyone is ready, there are a few creations I need to check on. First, we shall return to the spot where we found our wayward ambystoma."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Have care when you step outside a hub, for there may be more unruly creatures about."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"All vim and vigor now. Hmph. When we were discussing his nomination, he was melancholy incarnate."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Ah yes, the ianthine petalouda. One of the newest species of the ever-popular butterfly."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"...Hm? You're still bothered about your robe? Don't be. The few specimens we repurposed won't be missed."},{"name":"METEION","text":"So beautiful, petalouda! I hope they make it into the world!"},{"name":"HERMES","text":"This here is a new species of petalouda we recently set loose."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"It has been doing very well, managing to maintain a stable existence thus far. If it can see its observation period to the end without issue, we shall release it unto the world."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Tell me─do you know the difference between living beings and arcane entities?"},{"name":"HERMES","text":"It is the presence of a soul. Yet the soul isn't something you can choose to have at will."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"No, it manifests only in those beings whose forms adhere to the laws of creation. That can endure on their own."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Beings that do not fulfill this requirement, such as those spontaneously born of magic or natural phenomena, do not have souls."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"No matter how much it might resemble flora or fauna, if it lacks a soul, then it is considered an arcane entity."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"So you see, it is not for mankind to decide what is living. That domain lies beyond our manipulation, and it is hubris to assume otherwise."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"But come, let us head to the nearby beacon. I've received a report that arcane entities have gathered there."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"We're meant to be observing Hermes, but instead we're stuck with Meteion..."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Well, I suppose she herself serves as proof of his prowess as a researcher and creator both."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"A fascinating creation─much like yourself, little one. Renowned as Hermes is for his flying life-forms, 'tis a rare privilege to be able to see one of his works in progress."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Interesting! You're interesting too! Tell me, how did you find the ambystoma?"},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Ah, yes. Lightning pneuma, just as the report said."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Although we call this structure a beacon due to its form, it's in fact a magical device. By manipulating the balance of elements, it keeps the isle airborne and maintains the climate thereupon."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"In the course of its operation, it often sees an internal shift towards a given element."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Right now that element is lightning, which draws the pneuma here to replenish their aether."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"...Hmm, it appears Meteion is busy."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Would you care to assist me in her stead, and feed the pneuma?"},{"name":"HERMES","text":"By using this lightning converger, you can harness ambient lightning and focus it into a ball. A veritable feast for our dazzling friends."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Go on, give it a try."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Go on and use the lightning converger near the pneuma. It will harness ambient lightning and focus it into a ball. A veritable feast for our dazzling friends."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Perfectly done, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Look..."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"See how they gather to feed. How they express themselves through their actions despite their lack of words."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Speech is not the sole defining characteristic of a thinking, feeling creature. Nor is silence an indication that they do not possess these qualities."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Be it a soulless arcane entity such as the pneuma, or an ephemeral life-form such as the petalouda, all seek to perpetuate their existence. To survive."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Is Meteion an arcane entity?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Is Meteion a living being?"},{"name":"HERMES","text":"A good question. I can answer it from a theoretical standpoint, but it ultimately falls to the Bureau of the Architect to pass judgment."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Those with exceptional vision such as Hythlodaeus may be able to ascertain her true nature..."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"But to me, it doesn't matter. She is herself, and that is all I need to know."},{"name":"METEION","text":"Oh... You've finished already? I-I'm sorry... I was in the way..."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Not to worry, my dear. They missed nothing of note, and we still have plenty of work for them to observe."},{"name":"HERMES","text":"Next, we will head east to the Mourning Dew. I need to speak with some observers there."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"...Was there a guiding theme or any method to the madness that is this random assortment of features?"},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Ah, this fellow has been the talk of the bureau! The combination of a carefree aspect and endless rows of fangs is strangely charming!"},{"name":"METEION","text":"It's adorable, but beware its sneeze! Hermes went flying once!"}],"reward":{"gil":1102},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":86,"id":142}],"quests":[69959]},"next":[69961]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1040027","obj":{"i":1040027,"n":"Hermes","l":3713,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1040043","obj":{"i":1040043,"n":"Hermes","l":3713,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69959","obj":{"i":69959,"n":"Ponder, Warrant, Cherish, Welcome","g":11,"l":"Elpis","s":577}},{"type":"quest","id":"69961","obj":{"i":69961,"n":"Their Greatest Contribution","g":11,"l":"Elpis","s":579}}]}
