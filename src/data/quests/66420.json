Presuming it was not destroyed during the Calamity, he recommends that you elicit the cooperation of the astrologians at the Observatorium, who were doubtless monitoring the skies that night and possess information that may be valuable to the search. However, as Ishgardians are wont to turn away outsiders, Vortefaurt advises you to first offer your services to the soldiers who guard the Observatorium, as a gesture of goodwill.","Your offer of aid is curtly refused by the Ishgardian knight.

I held the spire alone that night, while the bulk of our forces marched to meet the enemy in the field."},{"name":"VORTEFAURT","text":"Then, all of a sudden, the most fantastic airship I'd ever seen splits the sky overhead!

But to obtain them, you would need to deal with the Ishgardians who control the region. I wouldn't expect much, thoughâ”€the High Houses have long been concerned with their own affairs above all else. When Dalamud descended, they took shelter behind their gates, and even now they have little regard for the plights of other nations."},{"name":"VORTEFAURT","text":"Nevertheless, they may deign to assist you should you prove yourself useful. Consider providing your services to the soldiers who guard the Observatorium. Though they may refuse you at first, I've little doubt they would accept aid freely offered."},{"name":"LUDOVOIX","text":"Excuse me, can you repeat that?
