Let us depart for Garlemald as soon as possible."},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"So that was a dragon's roar. Quite a trick, imbuing one's voice with aether."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"By all accounts, Azdaja is Golbez's prisoner, yet if she was in the Source..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"It could be that she managed to escape from the void, if only for a fleeting moment."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But that is mere conjecture. If we want the truth, then we must go and find it."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Come, let's make for Tertium. Our friends are waiting."},{"name":"VARSHAHNBIG","text":"I thought to depart from Radz-at-Han sooner, but Y'shtola insisted I bring warmer clothes."},{"name":"VARSHAHNBIG","text":"This vessel does not feel cold as such, but she reminded me that, so long as I am Varshahn, it would be prudent not to appear overly conspicuous."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I trust you know the “associates” who will be joining us. Hopefully they have been keeping well."},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"People live in such places, do they? Not that I would presume to know their preferences, but it seems...uncomfortable."},{"name":"VARSHAHNBIG","text":"I had tempered my hopes, but thanks to Alphinaud and Alisaie, we might yet learn something of Azdaja."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Nothing appears to be out of the ordinary here at the camp. Let us see what we find at this village."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"I knew the twins wouldn't disappoint."},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"A village of voidsent users... Lest you think I have feelings on this─I don't. What others do is not my concern."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I expect it's been a while since you spoke with Jullus. He will be glad to see you."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"The people here struggle to survive as it is. The last thing they need is for Garlemald to be overrun with voidsent."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. What a welcome surprise."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"And I see you're traveling with a large crew as usual..."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"Not to suggest that's an inconvenience for us. We'd be happy to share our supplies with you and your allies, should you require any."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Apologies if we interrupt, Jullus, but there is a matter we wish to discuss."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"We've just finished our routine briefing, so you come at a good time. Is this about the voidsent?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It is. From what we can discern, they're coming from the mountains to the east."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Practitioners of the reaper arts once lived in that area, did they not?"},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"Yes, they had a village there in the Lapis Manalis caverns."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"The scythe-wielders forged pacts with voidsent, and took to battle with the beings at their side. For a time they played an invaluable role in our military, but the advent of magitek saw them fall out of favor."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"And when some were unmasked as insurrectionists, the order was outlawed. The village is believed to be long abandoned."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"Speaking of their art...it seems you've picked it up. Who was it that taught you?"},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"...Well, I suppose it's neither here nor there now."},{"name":"VARSHAHNBIG","text":"My sister has been taken captive by voidsent. I sensed her presence in this land, and have come in search of her."},{"name":"VARSHAHNBIG","text":"If voidsent have been sighted here, then I believe there is a connection. We should like to investigate these caverns you mention, but Alphinaud tells us they are not easily reached."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"I'm afraid so. Deep snow and tumultuous winds rule out walking and flying."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"If you want to get anywhere, you're going to need a magitek snowcraft. Alas, the last remaining functional one we had has broken down. Should still be over in Cerulea Ingens, where it was abandoned."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Is there anyone who can fix it?"},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"Perhaps the former engineers at Tapper's Den."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"Their duty included transporting ceruleum tanks to Juturna Platform G using snowcraft. I expect they had to maintain a few over the years."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"That's worth looking into, I'd say."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"In the course of delivering provisions, I've come to know the people there quite well. If they can help us, I'm sure they will."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"May I ask you to accompany her? Given the presence of voidsent, it's best that we avoid traveling alone."},{"name":"VARSHAHNBIG","text":"In the meantime, will you not tell me more about the mountain? I would like to learn as much as I can before commencing our search in earnest."},{"name":"JULLUS","text":"Come with me. I'll introduce you to someone who's well versed in the local geography."},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"Alisaie, was it? I wish to speak with you."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"In that case, why don't you come with us to Tapper's Den? We can chat on the way."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I shall go and brief the contingent on the voidsent issue, that they too may be prepared."},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"If you want to eavesdrop, be my guest. It doesn't matter to me."},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We should get back to it, but before we do..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Are you all right, Zero? Did I say something that confused or upset you?"},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"...No. I'm simply trying to understand your perspective. If you wish to continue, I am ready and able."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, that's a relief! This isn't the sort of place you want to mull over things."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It's not much farther to Tapper's Den. I doubt we'll have much trouble finding an engineer when we arrive, so let's speak with the first one we spot."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"This is one of the engineers, I think."},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"Because it's the right thing to do..."},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"Wait, I know you. You're the one who roughed up the guards!"},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"After you left, your contingent friends came along. Our lives are a lot easier now thanks to them."},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"They understood our plight, and offered to help─whether we wanted to stay here or return home. For that, we're truly grateful."},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"We're grateful to you too, Alisaie. The trip across the lake is hardly pleasant, but you make it all the same to bring us provisions."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Oh, don't mention it. We're just glad we can help."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"That said, we were actually hoping to ask a favor of <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> today..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We need a magitek snowcraft repaired─the one abandoned in Cerulea Ingens. We were told you might be up to the task."},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"Ah, so you want to ride the mammoth!"},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"That's what we took to calling the crafts on account of their size."},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"As often as I used them on rigs, I know a thing or two about their maintenance. I'll see if I can get your mammoth roaring again─it's the least I can do to repay your kindness."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Wonderful! Please come with us back to Camp Broken Glass, and we'll take it from there."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"So far so good, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Let's be on our way."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Thank goodness we were able to find someone to help with repairs."},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"You mortals are more sensitive to the cold than I realized. My body is made differently, so I feel nothing."},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"Don't you worry─the mammoth is in good hands!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Welcome back."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I presume this is the engineer who will help us with the craft?"},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"I'll do everything I can to get her up and running again!"},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"But I doubt I'll be able to do so quickly─at least on my own. The mammoth is big, and so are its parts. Some strong backs should make the work go faster."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"You have ours."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"You've finished learning about the mountain, I take it?"},{"name":"VARSHAHNBIG","text":"Aye, we have a solid grasp of that area, as well as the site of the snowcraft."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"My back is perhaps not as strong as some, but I should be glad to stand guard for voidsent and other unruly wildlife."},{"name":"ENGINEER04671","text":"Much obliged, miss. Then let's all head over to the mammoth and assess what needs fixing."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"They have matters here well in hand. Which means we can resume our duties."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Would you care to assist us, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"How about you, Zero?"},{"name":"MYSTERIOUSPERSON","text":"I will assist you as well. As payment for answering my question."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It's hardly something that demands payment...but we'd be glad for your contribution nonetheless."}],"reward":{"gil":2772},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":90,"id":142}],"quests":[70206]},"next":[70208]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1044229","obj":{"i":1044229,"n":"Estinien","l":3707,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1044239","obj":{"i":1044239,"n":"Alphinaud","l":3710,"q":2}},{"type":"quest","id":"70206","obj":{"i":70206,"n":"Once More unto the Void","g":12,"l":"Radz-at-Han","s":638}},{"type":"quest","id":"70208","obj":{"i":70208,"n":"Kindled Spirit","g":12,"l":"Garlemald","s":640}}]}
