Lest they be taken unawares, he bids you make haste to the frozen wall and warn Ser Aymeric of the danger.","Your warning comes as little surprise to Ser Aymeric, who reveals that he had been anticipating an attack. Keen to reassure you, he pledges to place his knights on high alert. Perhaps Alphinaud will wish to do the same.","Even as Alphinaud laments the search operation's lack of progress, two heretics reveal themselves and charge towards the startled young man. Before you can rise to his defense, Yda appears as if from nowhere and subdues the heretics with a flurry of blows. The battle for Snowcloak has begun, and for a moment, Alphinaud is concerned─until the fortuitous discovery of a promising tunnel serves to brighten his spirits. Alas, the tunnel is rather narrow, and will not accommodate more than a handful of troops at a time. Given that additional numbers may prove more a hindrance than a help, it is decided that the task of charting the tunnel should be entrusted to a small and highly mobile party of seasoned adventurers. Speak with the stalwart Temple Knight to learn the location of the tunnel's entrance.","Were it not for the knight's directions, you would never have found the tunnel's entrance, which even now appears to be nothing more than a continuous piece of ice. What dangers lie within Iceheart's secret fortress? You know only that the heretics are expecting you─and that it would be a pity to disappoint them.<br><br>※Challenge Snowcloak with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point.","“What we do, we do for the greater good.”<br>...The words of a true believer, spoken in all solemnity by the woman once known as Ysayle. It is plain that she will not be swayed from her path. Though weary from your previous encounter, you prepare yourself for battle, only to see your foe make instead for the nearby aetheryte and teleport away. Iceheart has eluded you.","Though you failed to apprehend Iceheart, you have driven the heretics from their lair. Hopefully Alphinaud will take comfort in this partial victory.","Alphinaud receives your report with surprising optimism, turning his thoughts to how recent events might contribute to the Crystal Braves' good repute. Of course, everything is contingent upon the successful prevention of Shiva's summoning. But with the aid of the Scions─and you in particular─the young commander is confident that all will turn out as it should."],"objectives":["Speak with Aymeric at Snowcloak.","Speak with Alphinaud.","Speak with the stalwart Temple Knight.","Enter Snowcloak.","Report to Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"DRILLEMONT","text":"Time is of the essence, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

Amongst this warren of tunnels lies the entrance to Iceheart's lair! Summon the others─we're going in!"},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"A moment, Alphinaud! The tunnel in question is barely wide enough for two men abreast. We cannot say with any certainty where it leads, much less what is waiting for us there."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"Furthermore, we have no way of knowing how many heretics are still lurking here on the surface! What if they were to converge on this point after we entered the tunnel? For all we know, we could be funneling our forces into a trap!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...I take your point. If the tunnel is indeed as narrow as you say, greater numbers would be more a hindrance than a help. Should we encounter difficulty, our own allies would become an obstacle to escape."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Ahem! A change of plans. While we rendezvous with Ser Aymeric and keep the heretics at bay here, you will go wherever that tunnel leads."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If you find Iceheart at the end of it─do not let her escape."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"You venture into the unknown, so see that you are prepared for anything.
