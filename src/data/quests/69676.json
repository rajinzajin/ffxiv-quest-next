Today I'm going to show you how to make the most of what should be the best summers of your life!"},{"name":"JEROMERE","text":"Are you familiar with the concept of barbeques?"},{"name":"JUDE","text":"Bar...beques?"},{"name":"JEROMERE","text":"It is a culinary practice originating from the archipelagos off the coast of the New World. Various cuts of meat are thoroughly braised over the span of half a day."},{"name":"JEROMERE","text":"Many of our peers prefer studying alone in dreary silence, but that is not so with the poetry club. We gather round the fire of the barbeque, discussing the finer points of literature, reciting poetry as we watch the meat smoke and sear."},{"name":"JEROMERE","text":"Perhaps the flames that sear the meat will finally ignite a fire in your heart large enough to propel you into action.
