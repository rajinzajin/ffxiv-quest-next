She then bids you return to the Crystarium, where the Scions are no doubt anxious for your return.","With the threat of an Eighth Umbral Calamity averted, and Lord Vauthry's reign at an end, the people of Norvrandt now strive to build a new future for themselves. To that end, some have begun to seek truth in the past: they wish to understand the Flood which nearly consumed their world, as well as the role the Warriors of Light played in bringing it about. Alphinaud believes that the Scions should aid the people in this endeavor and divulge what they know to those willing to listen. He asks you and the others to fan out and invite the people of the Crystarium to the Exedra, after which you will then give them an accurate account of what happened all those years ago.","You and the Scions cover near every ilm of the Crystarium, and have garnered the curiosity of no few residents. All that remains is to await their arrival at the Exedra.","You expound the deeds of the Warriors of Light and the events leading up to the Flood, careful not to overlook even the smallest detail. The people of the Crystarium are moved by your words, and as you look out over the crowd, you spy a frighteningly familiar face─Ardbert. Soon finding himself the center of attention, he proclaims it was the will of the star that brought him back from the beyond, and that his purpose now is to guide the people of Norvrandt to become Warriors of Light themselves. But while the crowd hangs on his every word, the Scions stand apart, unconvinced. Rather than confront him openly, Urianger suggests you retire to the Ocular.<br><br>Considering the events leading to Emet-Selch's demise, there is no question you have been faced with an impostor. The Scions conclude that it must be an Ascian ploy, and to your knowledge only Elidibus remains to employ such a tactic. But to what end would he encourage the birth of new Warriors of Light?"],"objectives":["Speak with Alphinaud.","Speak with the people of the Crystarium.","Speak with Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I've apprised the others of this purported Warrior of Light who slew the sin eater.

Quite frankly, I'm not sure what to make of this."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Ah, yes. I was hoping to speak with you about, er... Hmm. On second thought, never mind. It would be rude of me to pry."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"An adventurer calling themself a Warrior of Light... Why would anyone tie themselves to the legacy of individuals held in such low regard in the First?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Warriors of Light. Harbingers of the Flood and all the world's woes. That this wanderer would so boldly claim their title is most curious indeed."},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"'Tis strange to think how heroes so beloved by the people could be brought so low in so short a time."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"I will not keep you. You and your comrades have much to discuss."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"I will see the others back to their posts."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The others were quite shocked to hear of what we found in Lakeland."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But now that you're here, there is a proposal I should like to make."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I have been spending a great deal of time in the Cabinet of Curiosity, and of late I have noted more and more people perusing books on history─the years leading up to the Flood, in particular."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I suspect they wish to know more about the Warriors of Light─as well they should─but nearly everything I've come across describes them as sin eaters or worse."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Regardless of whether or not this “Warrior of Light” is who they claim to be, I worry that their sudden appearance, in conjunction with this renewed interest in their predecessors, may lead to growing unrest and fear."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If the people of the Crystarium seek the truth, I say we give it to them."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I too can attest to the falsehoods found within full many of the Cabinet's tomes, with nary a mention of the noble deeds of Ardbert and his comrades."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"To be fair, they bear some responsibility for the Flood. But when the tale is told again and again over the course of a century, I am not surprised to see their roles distorted and them painted as villains."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Were it not for the records stored within the Crystal Tower, I would have had no reason to question the narrative."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Unfortunately, that knowledge was of no use, for when I arrived here in the First, their reputation had already been irreparably tarnished."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"That said, there still remained those who worked tirelessly to defend their good name in those early days following the Flood."},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"Considering all the good they had done, I find it a wonder they needed defending at all."},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"They brought to justice the man who misused my knowledge to bring about the fall of Voeburt. That such heroes could be spoken of in the same breath as sin eaters is absurd."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Under normal circumstances I would agree, but as time passed, those who knew firsthand of their deeds dwindled. In the end, only one truth remained─that they were the cause of the Flood."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"With the world on the brink of oblivion, it was all too easy for the Warriors of Light to become villains deserving only of resentment and hate."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"At that point, the truth mattered little. It would not change their lot."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Thanks to all of you, however, their lot <span class=\"emphasis\">has</span> changed, and now they may heed the long-forgotten truth."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"You claimed it was Ardbert who helped you overcome Emet-Selch, correct? Such a revelation would do well to sway the hearts of those who know him only as a villain."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"I have shared this with a select few, but one and all must be told of his sacrifice."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"To that end I say we proceed with Alphinaud's plan. We call together the people of the Crystarium and recount to them the true tale of the Warriors of Light and the Flood that followed in their wake."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well? What say you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? "},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Spread the word, I say!"},{"name":"A2","text":"I wish we had done this sooner."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Then we're all of one mind on the matter. Good."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"In hindsight, I agree. But better late than never, no?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Exarch, might I ask you to continue working with Beq Lugg on our means of returning home? The rest of us will see to gathering the people of the Crystarium in the Exedra."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We have to reach out to anyone and everyone who might be willing to lend an ear. With any luck, word will spread and more will accompany them."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"There can be no darkness without light, and so it was that Ardbert was there in your hour of need. The people must be told."},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"I have seen many a great and terrible thing in my long life, as has the Exarch no doubt. Of man I can say this: his memory is short, his heart fickle. Let us pray that your words reach him."},{"name":"CHESSAMILE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! My, what a wonderful surprise. Though I hope your being here doesn't mean someone's been hurt."},{"name":"CHESSAMILE","text":"Thanks to you I've had far fewer patients coming through my door of late. Which is a shame, come to think of it─I've had fewer opportunities to test my new medicines."},{"name":"CHESSAMILE","text":"Hee hee, I jest, of course! It's actually been quite pleasant to have a few moments to myself now and again."},{"name":"CHESSAMILE","text":"The truth about the Warriors of Light? But the Exarch has already spoken with me about them. Well, if there's more to the tale, I'd very much like to hear it."},{"name":"BRAGI","text":"Come to browse wares in the market, have you? Well I can guarantee you'll have no trouble finding what you need, whatever it may be. Under Eulmore's new leadership, trade has never been more prosperous."},{"name":"BRAGI","text":"Word is that fellow from Daedalus Stoneworks has taken over as mayor. Did he really? Little wonder business is booming the way it is."},{"name":"BRAGI","text":"I imagine it won't be long before all of Norvrandt reaps the benefits... But you've not come to talk about the market. Something on your mind?"},{"name":"BRAGI","text":"I see. The Exarch did mention they had something to do with your returning the night to Norvrandt. All right, consider my interest piqued."},{"name":"GLYNARD","text":"Well, well. To what do I owe the pleasure? Whatever it is, I must ask you be brief─with the night returned, visitors have been flocking to the Crystarium, and I find myself too busy by half."},{"name":"GLYNARD","text":"I don't mind it, though. Seeing the Stairs so full of life and excitement, one can almost forget the Flood ever happened."},{"name":"GLYNARD","text":"The Warriors of Light? Yes, the Exarch has mentioned them before, but everyone knows them now as the Cardinal Virtues. Or are you suggesting there's more to it than that?"},{"name":"GLYNARD","text":"Well, you've yet to steer us wrong, so I'm willing to hear what you have to say."},{"name":"GLYNARD","text":"The truth about the Warriors of Light? But you already told me all there is to know...didn't you?"},{"name":"GLYNARD","text":"Well, if there's more to their story, I'd love to hear it. Maybe then I can compete with Cyella in regaling patrons with stories of their heroism. Perhaps I'll even inspire a few aspiring adventurers."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"Well, well, what a coincidence! I was just reading over a letter I received from Grenoldt not long ago."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"He says a visitor from the Crystarium found him at the bottom of the ocean, and that <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> inspired him to reach new artistic heights. Well, I can only think of one person capable of both feats─though I'd say the latter is far more impressive."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"To think fate could bring the two of you together in such a place..."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"I'm sorry? You mean the Exarch didn't tell us the whole story of the Warriors of Light? Well whatever he's left unsaid, I'm all ears."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"No, this can't be... Surely there is at least <span class=\"emphasis\">one</span> book here that does not cast the Warriors of Light and their deeds in such a negative light..."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Forgive me. The Cabinet of Curiosity has been bustling with visitors of late, but I fear our repository lacks for the knowledge they seek."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"The people wish to know the truth of the Flood. Of the Warriors of Light."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"I have searched high and low, but alas... Every account portrays them as no better than sin eaters─abominations worthy only of scorn and resentment."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"I know they were not always judged so harshly, yet I can find no proof. And I dare call myself a librarian..."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"You would address the people and tell them the truth of the Warriors of Light? Of the Flood?"},{"name":"MOREN","text":"How wonderful! You have regaled me with the tale once before, but I should love to hear it again. Oh, and you may be assured I will not come alone."},{"name":"CHESSAMILE","text":"I wouldn't miss this for anything. And I promise I'll bring others with me."},{"name":"BRAGI","text":"We're to gather in the Exedra, is that right? If it's all the same to you, I'd like to bring a few others with me. People deserve to know about this."},{"name":"GLYNARD","text":"Cyella has agreed to keep watch over the Stairs in my absence. I'll be along to the Exedra soon."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"I'm sure everyone would like to know what really happened all those years ago."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"I will make for the Exedra as soon as I finish cataloging these manuscripts."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Those I spoke with at the orchard and the Rookery were quite keen to hear what we have to say. For as much hope as they have for the future, the scars of the past weigh heavy on them still."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"'Tis good to see the people of the Crystarium so eager to learn the truth."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"And with this newfound knowledge of the past, they will at last be able to look to the future with eyes unclouded."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"There you are. Between the four of us, I daresay we've swept the Crystarium from top to bottom. Now we need but wait for the people to gather."}],"reward":{"gil":1165,"items":[{"num":2,"id":27887,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":27885,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":27886,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":27994,"one":1}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":142}],"quests":[69299]},"next":[69301]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1032502","obj":{"i":1032502,"n":"Lyna","l":2953,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1032503","obj":{"i":1032503,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2951,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"27887","obj":{"i":27887,"n":"Pixieberry Tea","l":450,"c":24415,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"27885","obj":{"i":27885,"n":"Popoto Salad","l":450,"c":24164,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"27886","obj":{"i":27886,"n":"Robe Lettuce Salad","l":450,"c":24154,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"27994","obj":{"i":27994,"n":"Nightworld Silver Piece","l":385,"c":26001,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"69299","obj":{"i":69299,"n":"Seeking Counsel","g":9,"l":"The Ocular","s":130}},{"type":"quest","id":"69301","obj":{"i":69301,"n":"A Sleep Disturbed","g":9,"l":"The Ocular","s":150}}]}
