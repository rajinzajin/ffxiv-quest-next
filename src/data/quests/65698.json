Spare Naoh a measure of suffering by questioning the boorish lout in her stead.","Amidst a goodly share of empty bluster and braggadocio, Eral offers you just enough information to track down the log's owner, a young lass whose name he has already forgotten.

Oh─do forgive me, friend. Once again, one of our customers has departed without her belongings, and I'm at a loss for what to do about it."},{"name":"NAOHGAMDUHLA","text":"While I understand that adventurers have many cares on their minds, 'twould make my life much easier if they could keep their personal effects in order. But you did not come here to lend an ear to my grumblings."},{"name":"NAOHGAMDUHLA","text":"This is the book in question. The face of its owner was unfamiliar to me, but Eral over there seemed quite smitten with her─as with every pretty lass he lays his eyes on, but that's neither here nor there. Might I trouble you to inquire as to the girl's whereabouts? I've found the man to be less than forthcoming ever since I spurned his advances."},{"name":"ERAL","text":"Ah, the sweet little thing with the journal? 'Course I remember her, and remember her well. Had a smile to warm the heart, and a laugh─a lilt, one might say?─to tickle the depths of the soul. And she was most eager to hear tales of my many travels, which speaks to a keen and sensitive mind."},{"name":"ERAL","text":"Jilly, I believe was her name? No, that's not right─Jilly was the redhead from last week. Ah, damned if I can remember! You must understand, no small number of comely lasses seek out my company. I daresay keeping all the names and faces straight is an adventure in itself."},{"name":"ERAL","text":"Anyroad, the girl spoke of paying a visit to Apkallu Falls before traveling on.

You've something of mine, you say?"},{"name":"MILLITHIRONHEART","text":"My journal! Thank the Twelve! In my haste to escape the clutches of that insufferable mutton-monger, it slipped my mind entirely. Might I be so bold as to ask your name?"},{"name":"MILLITHIRONHEART","text":"You have my gratitude, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. It may not look like much, but I count this humble diary among my most prized possessions."},{"name":"MILLITHIRONHEART","text":"Its pages brim with tales of the most heart-stirring sights to be seen in our realm, as told to me by the sensitive souls I have met in my travels across Eorzea─tales that have struck me with a most incurable case of wanderlust."},{"name":"MILLITHIRONHEART","text":"As an adventurer, you too have seen the realm, I am sure. But I would ask you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>: have you truly <span class=\"emphasis\">seen</span> her?
