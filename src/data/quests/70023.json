You are entrusted with gathering some soma cores in order to cool the sun.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","You obtain the requested cores for Mussalfret. The artificial sun has not yet exploded, which seems like a good sign.","With the soma cores, Mussalfret wastes no time in returning the artificial sun to a state of stability, and disaster is averted thanks to yours and Verpaulaine's efforts. What's more, the boy's relationship with his father seems to have been mended in the process. Verpaulaine bids you visit him in Sharlayan Hamlet once more so he can thank you properly.","Verpaulaine gives you your payment with gratitude and the hope you might meet again once he becomes a researcher in his own right."],"objectives":["Slay center somas and obtain their cores.","Deliver the soma cores to Mussalfret.","Speak with Verpaulaine."],"dialogue":[{"name":"VERPAULAINE","text":"Come on, let's waste no time in showing this to Father.

I was just about to come home and tell you that I found the problem with the sun."},{"name":"MUSSALFRET","text":"Are you still harping on about that? You could've got yourself hurt pursuing this nonsense!"},{"name":"MUSSALFRET","text":"And you. I told you to bring my son back to me and instead you go off gallivanting with him!?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"He's right, you know."},{"name":"A1","text":"We've got proof that all is not well."},{"name":"MUSSALFRET","text":"Fine. I shall hear what you have to say."},{"name":"MUSSALFRET","text":"Oh my. I have never seen a core like this in my life. I see no reason to doubt your suggestion that it was feeding on the fire-aspected aether."},{"name":"VERPAULAINE","text":"So you finally admit that I was right about the sun?"},{"name":"MUSSALFRET","text":"Well, yes... However, that matters not now that I know how serious the situation is."},{"name":"VERPAULAINE","text":"What do you mean? <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s already slain the anala.
