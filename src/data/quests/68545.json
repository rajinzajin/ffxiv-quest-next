Owing to a recent theft of decorations, however, the festival now suffers from a lack of staff, as many have been tasked with tracking down the perpetrators. Amh Garanjy bids you consult with Baenfaeld in Bentbranch Meadows if you wish to be of assistance.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","The children of Bentbranch Meadows are inconsolable following the theft of the decorations they worked so hard to prepare. Luckily, Baenfaeld has a proposal. He and a trio of crimson-clad bears have been preparing a special treat for the festival, sure to bring a smile to one and all. Once you have chosen one of the three bears to act as your mount, the next part of the plan can be put into action.","Having selected the right bear for the job, you are now ready to bring cheer to the local youngsters.

It seems he has something weighing on his mind.","It would appear that Taff has vital information relating to the theft of the decorations. However, the other locals dismissed his account, despite his conviction.
