In order to forestall further maintenance, he has asked you to clean up three such piles of sand in the immediate vicinity. He has also warned you of the smoke bombs that may have burrowed into them.","With much grit and elbow grease, you have banished both the sand piles and the bombs that lay within. Inform Mumugoi of the happy development.","Mumugoi was thrilled to see you so easily dispatch the nuisances infecting the Strike. However, he informs you there is much and more to do, as the dangerous smoke bombs which surround the dig are often drawn in by the heat of the machinery. In order to keep the work site free of unwanted visitors, extinguish four of these fiends.","You have defeated four smoke bombs in an exemplary fashion. The heat-loving creatures perished in strange jubilation, for to them your dripping, febrile form was as a thing divine. Report your success to Mumugoi.","Mumugoi rejoices in the knowledge that four of the area's bombs have been taken care of. He also seems appreciative to have been able to devote more time to his chosen profession instead of the vexatious details that usually preoccupy his time."],"objectives":["Remove the sand dunes and dispatch smoke bombs.","Speak with Mumugoi.","Slay smoke bombs.","Report to Mumugoi."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MUMUGOI","text":"You see all this?
