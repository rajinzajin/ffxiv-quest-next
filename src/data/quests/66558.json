Hurrrggghhh...! Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose you don't speak zomblish. You'll have to forgive me. I've been feeling awfully depressed of late."},{"name":"HAB","text":"And why shouldn't I, what with you and your friends always trying to hack me limb from limb. Why, it's as if my rotting, malodorous flesh and propensity for snacking on adventurer brains has made me some sort of a pariah."},{"name":"HAB","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; The only ones who ever treated me with any decency were my sabotender friends, and I haven't seen them in ages.

He assured me that he merely got lost, and I smell just fine. At least, that's what I think he meant to say."},{"name":"HAB","text":"Why, that leaves only Sabotendale. He was always the shy, retiring type. He was relaxing in his favorite pot when it was stolen away by a band of Amalj'aa brigands. Could you find him for me?

Mine's long dead─<span class=\"emphasis\">dead</span> dead, not <span class=\"emphasis\">un</span>dead like me. Still, just knowing that I have friends in this vast, lonely world is enough for me.
