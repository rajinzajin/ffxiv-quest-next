Surely, someone at Fisherman's Bottom has seen something.","Your inquiries have garnered answers, and you have learned that the cask of ale may have ended up exactly where it was supposed to, after all─with the Bloody Executioners aboard their ship, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Astalicia</span>. It might be best to head off in that direction to confirm whether the customer was indeed the thief.","It turns out that one of the underling pirates had more thirst than sense, and so brings down his captain's wrath upon him. The good captain would have you courier the payment to Dodozan.","Dodozan is pleased to see the money and even more pleased that a watery demise will not be an item on his personal ledger this day. Moenskaet is correct, after all; it takes cods to trade with folk who have a long keel."],"objectives":["Speak with people around Fisherman's Bottom.","Speak with the young Executioner on the <span class=\"emphasis\">Astalicia</span>.","Deliver the payment to Dodozan."],"dialogue":[{"name":"DODOZAN","text":"Oh my, oh dear.

You would have the client's name? Oh, none of that. Discretion creates opportunities. Now do go to Fisherman's Bottom and make your inquiries before this cold of mine grows worse!<br>&lt;cough&gt; (The Bloody Executioners!) &lt;cough&gt;"},{"name":"MERCHANT01426","text":"Did I see someone walk off with a cask of ale? Why, sure, it was during the afternoon off-loading."},{"name":"MERCHANT01426","text":"Fella didn't look like a thief, though.

The fella wasn't acting like any kind of thief I've seen."},{"name":"DELIVERYMAN01426","text":"Lookin' for Dodozan's cask of ale, eh? Aye, I'll help you. Dodozan ain't a bad sort, for a swivin' trader. There was a toper come askin' after the cask. Wanted to know if it was ale, the poxy fool."},{"name":"DELIVERYMAN01426","text":"Reeked of rum and puke, that one. Not no kind of workin' man, and you know what that means 'round these parts."},{"name":"FISHWOMAN01426","text":"After a cask? Well, can't rightly say if it's <span class=\"emphasis\">your</span> cask, but there was a big fella come by recently carrying one."},{"name":"FISHWOMAN01426","text":"He asked me if I had smoked mackies what would go down nice with ale. 'Tain't the only thing I know, neither; the louse wore black, and you know what that means: the Bloody Executioners!"},{"name":"FISHWOMAN01426","text":"Already said more'n I should.

Well said, Cap'n! And well retorted, ye bloody Sun Seeker! Or was you a Moon Keeper...? What other lands they got there? Bah, who even cares, am I right!?"},{"name":"STAFF01426","text":"...Who <span class=\"emphasis\">are</span> you, anyway? There was a whole passel of you afore, but now there'sh only one. That's a miser's trick, it is."},{"name":"STAFF01426","text":"Ungh... Nope, nothin' worshe than a miser. This whoreson what was a Madrigal...er...<span class=\"emphasis\">Admiral</span>...

Hah, 'course you're right there, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lassie</span><span class=\"alternative\">laddie</span></span>! Should never doubt meself.

We'd be much obliged."},{"name":"MOENSLAET","text":"You danced with us an' all, so I'm trusting the gil won't inspire any moral failings in ye.

Well, that's the price I was to receive, but where did you get it?"},{"name":"DODOZAN","text":"Oh, from the Bloody─er, I mean, from the clients themselves? I see. Yes, there's always some blustery young fellow like that. Hasn't earned his swallows or stars yet, I'll wager."},{"name":"DODOZAN","text":"Cods, you say? Captain Moenskaet is kind to say so, I'm sure, but I hail from Ul'dah. We trade with <span class=\"emphasis\">anyone</span> if they've gil to pay.
