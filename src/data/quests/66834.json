Seek out the lass─Yellow Moon of the Weavers' Guild in Ul'dah─and see what ails her.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","Yellow Moon would return the affection of her many admirers in the traditional Valentione's Day manner─with chocolate─yet her admirers are too many and her kitchen shelves too bare. Travel about town and procure the necessary ingredients from her acquaintances, taking care not to make any unnecessary promises.","You have procured some most curious ingredients from young men eager to please. Return to the Weavers' Guild and deliver them to Yellow Moon, who is sure to be pleased.","Yellow Moon is appreciative of your efforts, but her culinary magnum opus has just begun. Take to the streets once more to procure the additional ingredients she needs.","You have obtained yet more unusual ingredients from the lovesick young men. What manner of confection can be made from morbol bile, anyway? Such concerns notwithstanding, return to the Weavers' Guild and deliver the goods to the hardworking Yellow Moon.","Yellow Moon continues to slave away at her stove and─perhaps not surprisingly─would be <span class=\"emphasis\">terribly</span> appreciative if you could acquire one last set of ingredients for her. It is fortunate the young miss has so many “friends” to help her...","You have procured the final batch of ingredients from young men who regard the golden-tressed lass as some sort of deity. Is this stuff even edible? Return to the Weavers' Guild and deliver them to Yellow Moon before you are arrested and tossed in gaol for possession of hazardous substances.","Yellow Moon rejoices─thanks to your selfless acts, she will be able to fashion a batch of chocolate sizable enough to feed all of her admirers, most importantly her one true love. In an entirely unrelated turn of events, numerous residents of Ul'dah─strangely, all male─have been stricken down by a vile poison. Take your reward, a present from Yellow Moon for your kindness, and make a discreet retreat before you can be implicated in the plot."],"objectives":["Speak with Yellow Moon at the Weavers' Guild in Ul'dah.","Obtain ingredients from Yellow Moon's admirers.","Deliver the ingredients to Yellow Moon.","Obtain ingredients from Yellow Moon's admirers.","Deliver the ingredients to Yellow Moon.","Obtain ingredients from Yellow Moon's admirers.","Deliver the ingredients to Yellow Moon."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LISSETE","text":"Across the realm, hearts pine and yearn. How fare you in bringing them succor?"},{"name":"LISSETE","text":"You know not where to look? Why did you not say so sooner!? By the powers vested in me by my ancestors, I shall divine for you the whereabouts of a heart in need!"},{"name":"LISSETE","text":"What have we here...? Oh, for woe! Yellow Moon of Ul'dah, she of sun-kissed tresses, would deliver to her beloved a gift straight from the heart, yet she struggles most painfully in the process. In the name of House Valentione, I command you to hasten to her side!"},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"Whatever shall I do now? Poor Yellow Moon, this time you may have finally bitten off more than you can...hm?"},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"Beg pardon, friend. I am not one to impose on the kindness of strangers, but I find myself in a most pressing predicament."},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"This year, I promised myself that I would surprise my numerous admirers with an assortment of homemade Valentione's chocolates. I soon realized, however, that I had completely miscalculated the sheer volume of ingredients needed to prepare such a quantity of confections."},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"They say that the surest way to a man's heart is to cut a hole through his guts and innards...or something like that, yes? Why, if my culinary creations fail to sate my admirers' prodigious appetites, potential flames of love might be quenched without ever having had the chance to blaze!"},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"As I said, I am loath to impose upon the kindness of strangers. That said, I imagine there are a few individuals about town─<span class=\"emphasis\">male</span> individuals─who might show some sympathy for my plight. You'll seek them out, yes? A simple mention of my name should suffice─no need to go into detail."},{"name":"YMSHINEIA","text":"Yellow Moon sent you!? Well, it's about time!"},{"name":"YMSHINEIB","text":"I've been holding onto this phial of ziz venom for her for nigh on a fortnight now! Nasty bugger almost chewed my arm clean off, it did."},{"name":"YMSHINEIB","text":"Just between you and me, I'd take on a horde of those beasts for the faintest sliver of hope at receiving even a morsel of her homemade chocolate. Yes, my love, none are more devoted to you than I!"},{"name":"YMSHINEIB","text":"Yellow Moon? You were sent by Yellow Moon!? <span class=\"emphasis\">My</span> Yellow Moon!? Of course, I would happily donate this orobon liver to her cause!"},{"name":"YMSHINEIB","text":"Oh, my precious Yellow Moon! It only pains me that it is not my <span class=\"emphasis\">own</span> liver that I gift unto you! ...Actually, I suppose that would pain me somewhat more. And yet I would present the gift no less willingly! Such is the depth of my love!"},{"name":"YMSHINEIB","text":"Oh, my precious Yellow Moon!

Were my friends as cooperative as I imagined they might be?"},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"Ziz venom and an orobon liver? I couldn't have asked for more! My friends are far too kind─yes, this batch of sweets will be my most passionately potent one yet!"},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"And yet, with so many friends, so many chocolates remain to be fashioned! I say, might I trouble you to make the rounds once more? I suspect that I might have just a <span class=\"emphasis\">few</span> more friends out there willing to come to my aid."},{"name":"YMSHINEIC","text":"Yellow Moon sent you!? Bahahaha, that's a laugh!<br>Why would she not come to see her loyal admirer herself, hm? Hmmm!? I trust you about as far as I could throw you─actually, a fair bit less!"},{"name":"YMSHINEIC","text":"Then again, what if you do speak true? If I refuse you, my beloved might never speak to me again! Ah, damn it all─I am but a fool in love, but I would have it no other way. Take this, and begone from my sight!"},{"name":"YMSHINEIC","text":"I know not what need Yellow Moon has for morbol bile, but it is not my place to ask. So long as it brings a smile to the fair lass's face, I ask for no more."},{"name":"YMSHINEID","text":"Yellow Moon has no interest in me, this I know. I doubt she even knows my name. Why, to tell the truth, I'm not even sure I remember it myself."},{"name":"YMSHINEID","text":"What were we talking about again? Does it even matter? I think not. Take this and give it to Yellow Moon. Or don't. Just leave me to my fantasies. They're so much more compelling than reality, you know."},{"name":"YMSHINEID","text":"What day is it again? Valentione's Day? That's the furthest thing from my mind. Or it would be, if I had even heard of such a silly holiday to begin with. Which I haven't. So there."},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"So many chocolates to make, and my secret ingredients vanish from my shelves moment by moment! Whatever is a comely young lass like myself to do?"},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"Why, I am surrounded by saints─both you and my many friends! Yes, I simply must return the favor..."},{"name":"YELLOWMOON","text":"And yet, curse it all! I lack for the ingredients to express my gratitude. Might I impose upon you just once more? It would mean ever so much to me. Pretty, pretty please?"},{"name":"YMSHINEIE","text":"Yellow Moon has sent you, yes? Of course. It was but a matter of time before she came to me─her one true love. I give you this, knowing that whatever divine confection she prepares is for me, and me alone."},{"name":"YMSHINEIE","text":"Now be off with you. You are but a tool that serves to join me with my beloved, and every moment you tarry here serves but to delay our glorious destiny."},{"name":"YMSHINEIE","text":"Be off with you. You are but a tool that serves to join me with my beloved, and every moment you tarry here serves but to delay our glorious destiny."},{"name":"YMSHINEIF","text":"My goddess sent you, you say? Stand still a moment. Yes, the scent of her perfume wafts gently through the air to my nostrils."},{"name":"YMSHINEIF","text":"What I give unto you, I retrieved from the depths of the seventh hell. I know not to what end my goddess requires it, but it is not my place to ask. I say only this: deliver it to her in good faith, or you will not wake to see the morrow."},{"name":"YMSHINEIF","text":"What I give unto you, I retrieved from the depths of the seventh hell.
