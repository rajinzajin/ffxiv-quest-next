Whether the followers of Nhaama can be convinced to let you use them is another question. And so you head back to Mol Iloh to consult Cirina on how best to proceed.","According to Cirina, while many Xaela tribes worship Nhaama, none are more fervent in their faith than the Dotharl. Obtaining their consent will consequently be key. While they are unlikely to grant it lightly, Hien is convinced that gaining the support of such fearless warriors will be well worth the effort. Accordingly, you set out for Dotharl Khaa to treat with the tribe's khatun, Sadu.","In a wholly unsurprising turn of events, Sadu agrees to support Hien's cause only if you first face her in single combat. She duly bids you wait for her outside the settlement, in Nhaama's Retreat.","Your duel has scarcely begun when Magnai─in <span class=\"emphasis\">another</span> wholly unsurprising turn of events─interrupts proceedings, apparently displeased that a battle to determine the fate of the Steppe should be waged without his blessing. Incensed by Sadu's subsequent mockery, he draws his axe and charges at his Dotharl counterpart only to find Hien and Y'shtola barring his way. While they keep the Sun company, you and Sadu may resume your dance nearby.","At the end of a furious struggle, you and your companions emerge triumphant over your respective opponents, securing the allegiance of the Dotharl and the Oronir, and sparing Hien an unsolicited initiation into the brotherhood of the Buduga. Satisfied with your work, you prepare to leave only for Magnai to accost Y'shtola wearing a curious expression. Despite trying to hack her to pieces but moments prior, the Sun is convinced that the Archon is his Nhaama, and propositions her with characteristic subtlety. Alas, his overtures are unceremoniously rejected, much to Sadu's amusement, prompting weapons to be drawn once more. Her patience spent, Y'shtola strides off back to Mol Iloh, and you and Hien follow, leaving the Xaela to their bickering.","Cirina is pleased to hear that you have succeeded in winning over the Dotharl and the Oronir, and formally commits the Mol to Hien's nascent alliance. Though the other tribes of the Steppe must each decide for themselves, she promises to send word the moment they have given their answers."],"objectives":["Speak with Y'shtola at the House of the Crooked Coin.","Speak with Cirina at Mol Iloh.","Speak with Sadu at Dotharl Khaa.","Wait at the designated location.","Report to Cirina at Mol Iloh."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HIEN","text":"Cirina is quite right. Before we seek permission to use these pillars, we should determine if they are suitable for our purposes."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"It seems the time is come to put my skills to use. Pray lead the way to the House of the Crooked Coin."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Well...it certainly looks powerful. But powerful enough? That, you'll have to ask the expert."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Well, it looks like I was right about the pillars. Now all we need is permission to use them."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"That such an abundant source of aether should lie undisturbed for millennia... 'Tis a miracle made possible by the Steppe's long history of isolation."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"You found that which you seek, then? Great indeed is the Dusk Mother's power. If naught less will suffice to protect our lands, the blessing of the other tribes must now be sought."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Of course. But to which tribes should we appeal?"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"There are many who worship Nhaama, but none are so fervent in their faith as the Dotharl. Their consent shall be the key."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"The Dotharl. Lyse spoke of them. A warlike tribe possessed of unique customs and beliefs. I sense their cooperation will not be easily won."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Nay, but it will be well worth the effort. The Dotharl fear nothing─death least of all─and our alliance would be greatly strengthened by their presence. Let us go to Dotharl Khaa and treat with their khatun, Sadu."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Great faith gives rise to great strength─for better or for worse. Whatever it is the Dotharl hold sacred, we would do well to accord it all respect."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Despite her fondness for battle, Sadu is an astute leader. If we plead our case in earnest, I am certain she can be persuaded."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"While you meet with the Dotharl, I shall send messengers to the other tribes. If Sadu can be swayed, I am certain more will follow."},{"name":"TEMULUN","text":"The Dusk Mother embodies love, but so too does she embody war. I pray that your meeting with Sadu will not end in blood."},{"name":"SADU","text":"You again? Other matters demand our time, khagan. Unless it is battle you seek?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Alas not. Quite the opposite, in fact..."},{"name":"SADU","text":"Talking, always talking... You say the pillars hold great power? Of course they do. They are the source of Nhaama's strength."},{"name":"SADU","text":"To the Dotharl, no place is more sacred, and we will make ash of any who would defile it. Though I see this is not your wish."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"You see the wisdom of our proposition, then? You will join hands with us?"},{"name":"SADU","text":"I said nothing of joining hands. You wish to wield Nhaama's power to defend these lands, and this I will allow. But for leaving the Steppe to fight the men in iron I would have something in return."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"...Namely?"},{"name":"SADU","text":"Namely <span class=\"emphasis\">battle</span>. With <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>, khagan!"},{"name":"SADU","text":"The Naadam ended ere it began.

Surely, these are agreeable terms?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Well, this is a...not wholly unexpected turn of events─though I had assumed <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> would be the one required to fight.

It shall be a battle the Steppe shall not soon forget!"},{"name":"SADU","text":"So you say. But the fire in your eyes tells another tale. You want this as much as I do!"},{"name":"SADU","text":"Ahhh, already my soul burns brighter! Prepare yourself, khagan, and await me outside the khaa. I will gather my witnesses and join you anon."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"When I was little, I would stride up to Gosetsu, wooden sword in hand, and challenge him. To his great credit, he never held back, and I had many a bump and bruise to show for it. &lt;sigh&gt;"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Try as I might, I fail to see the logic in this arrangement. I can but conclude there is none."},{"name":"SADU","text":"Why are you still here? Go. Wait for me outside the khaa.

Still...I cannot fault the man's bravery."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"...Offended? Not in the least. I am no stranger to clumsy propositions, and that, believe it or not, was far from the worst I have heard."},{"name":"SADU","text":"The Sun was quick to fade. After a few half-hearted swings, he shouldered his axe and sauntered off. But no matter.

Damn it all..."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"...You had not only to contend with Sadu, but <span class=\"emphasis\">Magnai</span> too!? Such a fierce battle that must have been. Yet here you stand, triumphant. Having passed such a test, they could not well deny you their allegiance."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"The Mol will make no such demands. Weak though we are, we will gladly stand with you. The Steppe is our home, and we will defend it with all our being."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"You have my heartfelt thanks!
