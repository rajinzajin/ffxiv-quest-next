Urianger suggests that she return to the connecting fragments of Dalamud in your company, in hopes that your presence will set events in motion, as it has so often in the past. In the meantime, the Archon promises to seek answers of his own. Make your way to the fragment situated at the Burning Wall in eastern Thanalan, and speak with Alisaie's assistant who has been reconnoitering the site.","To your disappointment, Alisaie's assistant reports that he has been unable to identify a viable path to the fragment's exterior, let alone a means to access its interior. Just as you are about to leave for Mor Dhona, where the next fragment lies, he adds that he has lost contact with his brother there. Make haste to the Singing Shards, and ensure that the man does not come to harm.","You arrive at the Singing Shards just in time to prevent Alisaie's second assistant from coming to a sticky end. Unfortunately, the news he has for you is not good. If the fellow is to be believed, there will be no entering the fragment of Dalamud in Mor Dhona. Moments later, however, Urianger contacts you via linkpearl to notify you that he may have found a way to breach the remaining fragments. Make haste to the Ceruleum Processing Plant in northern Thanalan, where the Archon will furnish you with the details.","Urianger explains to you the method which he and certain other nameless individuals have conceived to reach the remaining internment hulks. Requiring that the laws of aetherial travel be bent to breaking point, the process entails considerable danger, but Alisaie is willing to take the risk. Meet her at the crystal formation known as Dalamud's Talons situated to the north of the plant.","Alphinaud arrives at Dalamud's Talons shortly after you do, revealing himself to be Urianger's mysterious collaborator. Having questioned his twin on the origin of her resolve, he declares that he will be joining your party on this descent into the Binding Coil. Speak with Erkenrad at the Ceruleum Processing Plant when you are ready to embark upon your mission.","Erkenrad acknowledges your readiness. At your word, you and your comrades will be transported directly inside the first of the two remaining internment hulks. Upon arrival, you must make your way to the main bridge and disable the coil responsible for Bahamut's regeneration. Spare no preparation and expect fierce resistance.<br><br>※The Final Coil of Bahamut can be accessed via the Duty Finder."],"objectives":["Speak with Alisaie's assistant at the Burning Wall.","Rescue Alisaie's assistant at the Singing Shards.","Speak with Urianger at the Ceruleum Processing Plant.","Speak with Alisaie.","Speak with Erkenrad."],"dialogue":[{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Man is wont to cast light wheresoever secrets lie hid in darkness─though that which he illuminateth seldom bringeth him joy.

I have not forgotten that my grandfather is waiting for us."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"My lady. I would remind you, as I must oft remind myself, that the man whom we both loved and revered is no more.

Very well, I shall do as you suggest."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...Assuming you have no objections, of course? Good. Now, we seek entry to two fragments of Dalamud. One lies at the Burning Wall in eastern Thanalan, and the other at the Singing Shards in Mor Dhona."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I left an assistant at each location with instructions to continue searching for a means of ingress. It is not impossible that they could since have found something useful to us. Let us begin by visiting my man at the Burning Wall.

Forgive me, my lady."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Confound it... We are losing precious time. What are we to do now?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"'Tis I, Urianger. Glad tidings have I for thee and my lady."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"For a blessing, a way hath been found by which thou mayest enter the remaining fragments of Dalamud."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Pray escort Mistress Alisaie to the Ceruleum Processing Plant in northern Thanalan. There, all shall be made clear."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Urianger has found a way!?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Then we must go to him at once!"},{"name":"INVESTIGATORB00043","text":"You needn't linger on my account. Should Master Urianger's method prove viable, rest assured I shall put many malms between myself and this place."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Mine apologies for summoning you thus from afar, my lady, but 'tis here that your journey may finally begin."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I did wonder. To my knowledge, there are no fragments in northern Thanalan."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Nor are you mistaken, my lady. Yet a pathway doth exist─one which you yourself have made use of in the past."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"At the conclusion of your several forays into the Binding Coil, 'twas at the crystal formation which lieth to the north of this place that you did emerge, was it not?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Yes. An aetherial stream bore us back to the surface─that much I had surmised. Are you suggesting that we can use it to return underground?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And even if that were possible, would it not simply bear us back to those places which we have already explored?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"It need not, my lady. Pray allow me to explain. Upon the evidence of your experience, it seemeth plain that two internment hulks may share the selfsame aetherial egress. From this, we did infer that others may be connected in like wise. Thus did we labor long to verify the existence of further tributaries to the selfsame stream─in which task we were at length successful. 'Twas then but a matter of arriving at a solution to the problem of traveling to an unattuned destination..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"That one might reach what we may call the headwater, we propose to employ a modified aetheryte which serveth to amplify such ripples as do originate from said source. By focusing one's essence upon these ripples, it should be possible to make the journey. Yet be fairly warned, my lady: as with all untried modes of aetherial travel, this method entaileth considerable danger. Merely to attempt the voyage could cost you your life."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"That is a risk I am willing to take! You are brilliant, Urianger!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But I am curious... Did you have assistance in forming this plan? I could not help noticing your repeated use of the word “we”─unless you have taken to using the majestic plural in our absence?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"...Ah. Ahem. Nay, my lady. As you have correctly surmised...I was not alone in this endeavor."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...Meaning there are others who are aware of our mission."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, it cannot be helped now. Preventing Bahamut's return is what matters. If some secrecy must be sacrificed to achieve our goal, then so be it."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Verily, 'twas not my wish to withhold knowledge of the aid I received... I pray that Mistress Alisaie will forgive me when she learneth of its source..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"So that must be the modified aetheryte. But what are the Immortal Flames doing here...?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"(-???-)Those men may be sworn Flames of Ul'dah, but they are first and foremost faithful retainers of House Leveilleur."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Alphinaud!? So it was <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> who was helping Urianger!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Who else could it have been, dear sister?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Lest you worry, I have no intention of making the details of your venture public. Like you, I would prefer to avoid causing a panic."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But given that which is at stake─namely, the survival of the realm─one must be willing to accept help when it is offered. Would you not agree?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"At the very least, do not be cross with Urianger─'twas at my behest that he kept silent."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Hmph! We will speak later!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Pray forgive me, my lady, but knowing full well your intent, I judged it meet that Master Alphinaud be informed."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Though your grandsire hath become Bahamut's thrall, his noble blood courseth yet through both your veins, and if he must needs be struck down─"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Do you hear that, Alphinaud? I mean to <span class=\"emphasis\">strike down Grandfather</span>! And when I have done so, I shall banish Bahamut to the aether!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Nothing you say will sway me from my course! I <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> protect Eorzea, and I <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> uphold Grandfather's legacy!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Grandfather's legacy...? So you still do not know what you yourself desire. Your actions are still driven by borrowed resolve."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Borrowed resolve!? What does that have to do with anything!?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Protecting Eorzea was Grandfather's goal, and we made it ours─both of us! That is why we came here, unless you have forgotten!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Gods forbid I should ever forget, Alisaie. But you misunderstand. I do not question your resolve, only whence it came. If it were your own, you would be able to tell me precisely <span class=\"emphasis\">why</span> you desire so fervently to protect Eorzea."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Yet you cannot, for it is not <span class=\"emphasis\">your</span> resolve, but Grandfather's. You may struggle to see the difference, but borrowed resolve shall never be as strong as that which springs from within."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...But let us speak of this another time. For now, preventing Bahamut's return is all that matters."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"To be plain, I have no objection to striking down whatever is left of Grandfather. Know, however, that I will be accompanying you this time. As a son of House Leveilleur, I would be present for his final moments."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...Very well. You may join us...on one condition: <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> make the decisions."},{"name":"ERKENRAD","text":"If it please milady, the name's Erkenrad. Our preparations are just about complete."},{"name":"ERKENRAD","text":"When you're ready to embark on your mission, just give me the word. I'll be waiting for you at the Ceruleum Processing Plant."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Pay no heed to my brother. You can rely on me. We have come far together, you and I, and together we shall see our journey to its end."},{"name":"ERKENRAD","text":"I've been waiting for you, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. I'm pleased to say that the aetheryte's primed and ready."},{"name":"ERKENRAD","text":"As you know, the remaining internment hulks are connected to the fragments in eastern Thanalan and Mor Dhona. It's to the former that we'll be sending you first."},{"name":"ERKENRAD","text":"Now, you'll be starting <span class=\"emphasis\">inside</span> the hulk, meaning you won't have to cover so much ground─the drawback being that you'll be fighting for your life from the moment you get there. Best be prepared for anything, for milady's sake if not your own."},{"name":"ERKENRAD","text":"And that's about all I can tell you. When your preparations are in order, just give me the word, and I'll send you on your way. I may even throw in a prayer for your speedy return just to be on the safe side."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You now have access to the Final Coil of Bahamut. The subterranean labyrinth can be accessed by speaking with Erkenrad."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"For details such as the conditions of entry, speak with the flame sergeant."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"So this is how it looks on the inside..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"This internment hulk still functions..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"The teleportation was a success─we are come to the right place."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"There is no telling how much further Bahamut has regenerated since we last beheld him."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Let us make haste to the main bridge and deactivate the coil."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"There were receptacles similar to these in the previous hulk."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Those held chimerical beasts, but only the Allagans know what other abominations may be sleeping within."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"They may well be part of Dalamud's internal defenses. We must stay on our guard at all times."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"By the Twelve... Dragons...and so many..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We were aware that the Allagans possessed the means to control the creatures, but to imprison them thus is...barbaric. I would not wish such a fate upon my worst enemy."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"'Tis plain that no love was lost between the Allagans and the dragons, but was it truly necessary to keep so great a number here?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Dalamud did not want for defenses, this we have experienced firsthand. Such guardians as the Allagans created─both living and unliving─were surely no less capable of repelling intruders than these poor creatures..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Tell me something, Alisaie."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Have you not managed to determine by whose will Bahamut exists?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"No, I have not. At first, I assumed that Bahamut had no people of his own─that the Allagans had perhaps discovered a way to simulate prayer itself."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"However, Nael's words gave me cause to reconsider─specifically, the shade's mention of Bahamut's “beloved children.”"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"From that, I inferred that the primal is given form by the will of worshipers whom we have yet to─"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Oh."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Gods strike me down for a blind fool!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Bahamut's beloved children, right there before my very eyes... How could I be so stupid?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Who else but the dragons of eld would summon Bahamut? Who else but they could sustain him? And to think I wondered why the Allagans kept them imprisoned here!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Even should the flame of Bahamut's life go out, his faithful children would summon him back."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"For this reason, the Allagan Empire kept an army of dragons here in a perpetual state of duress, that they might sustain the primal's existence."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Truly, the Allagans' ingenuity knew no bounds...and neither did their cruelty."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Small wonder that Bahamut was so enraged! Let no one deny that it was man who sowed the seeds of the Calamity!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Will you now turn your hatred towards our own kind, dear sister?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Do not patronize me, Alphinaud. I merely acknowledge our guilt."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Lest you be in any doubt, I have no intention of allowing Bahamut to lay the world to waste, regardless of the atrocities the Allagans committed against his kind. We have no choice but to eliminate all who worship him, be they his children or his thralls."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It seems reasonable to assume that the system responsible for the primal's regeneration is also responsible for sustaining the captive dragons. If we disable it, all should perish. Let us press on."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Why, this looks like..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"A model of Dalamud, yes."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"For millennia, Bahamut must have gazed at this unchanging view."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Trapped inside a prison that was scarcely large enough to contain him, unable to move, denied the release of death... How his hatred for man must have burned."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And that hatred found an ideal vessel in Nael van Darnus."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"In many ways, Bahamut is to be pitied, not loathed.
