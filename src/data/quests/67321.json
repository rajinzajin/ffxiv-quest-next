Go to the ruins and see if the creatures were more than just ale-fueled visions.","At Mare's Oath, you find two lifelike dragon statues, which may pass for living creatures to a drunk. Return to Tailfeather and report your discovery to Remaclon.","Remaclon seems relieved at your news, and informs you that the ruins at Mare's Oath are said to have been constructed by heretics. He will be steering clear from that area in the future."],"objectives":["Investigate the specified area.","Report to Remaclon."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HUNTER01780","text":"All that's left is to restock on supplies and wait till it gets a li'l warmer and we can move back upstream."},{"name":"REMACLON","text":"There's no way in the seven hells that what I seen was right! You see, last night, I was takin' a stroll after a few pints, and stumbled on some ominous-lookin' ruins. 'Course ruins are pretty common 'round here, but what I saw ain't: dragons!"},{"name":"REMACLON","text":"That's right, <span class=\"emphasis\">dragons</span>! Two of them, with great big wings and fire in their eyes. I ran straight home at the sight of them. My memory's a bit hazy, but if it really <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span> dragons I seen, we could all be in danger. I can't very well go back there by myself, but, well...<br>I almost hate to ask, but do you think you could traipse on over to the ruins for me? I'll mark down the area I was wanderin' around in on your map."},{"name":"REMACLON","text":"If there's actually dragons there, we'll have a whole other set of problems! I've marked the location of the ruins on the map for youâ”€just remember to bring a weapon!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You see two dragon statues. The craftsmanship of each is exquisite. It is easy to see how one might confuse them with the real thing."},{"name":"REMACLON","text":"You're back! Did you see the dragons?<br>...Statues, you say!? Ugh, maybe I should go easier on the ale..."},{"name":"REMACLON","text":"They say those ruins up north were built by heretics. Even just goin' near them might have people doubtin' your allegiances."},{"name":"REMACLON","text":"Well, since there's no <span class=\"emphasis\">real</span> dragons, I guess there ain't nothin' to worry about! Now that I know what sort of place it is, I'll be sure to give it a wide berth."}],"reward":{"gil":502,"items":[{"id":10965,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":10989,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":11013,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":11037,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":11061,"one":1,"hq":1}],"xp":26400},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":52,"id":34}],"questsType":"all","quests":[67148,67316]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011919","obj":{"i":1011919,"n":"Remaclon","l":2000,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1013364","obj":{"i":1013364,"n":"Tailfeather Hunter","l":2000,"q":3}},{"type":"item","id":"10965","obj":{"i":10965,"n":"Mythrite Necklace of Fending","l":125,"c":54926,"t":40}},{"type":"item","id":"10989","obj":{"i":10989,"n":"Mythrite Necklace of Slaying","l":125,"c":54926,"t":40}},{"type":"item","id":"11013","obj":{"i":11013,"n":"Mythrite Necklace of Aiming","l":125,"c":54926,"t":40}},{"type":"item","id":"11037","obj":{"i":11037,"n":"Mythrite Necklace of Healing","l":125,"c":54926,"t":40}},{"type":"item","id":"11061","obj":{"i":11061,"n":"Mythrite Necklace of Casting","l":125,"c":54926,"t":40}},{"type":"quest","id":"67148","obj":{"i":67148,"n":"Gifts for the Outcasts","g":3,"l":"The Dravanian Forelands","s":33}},{"type":"quest","id":"67316","obj":{"i":67316,"n":"Uninvited Guests","g":98,"l":"The Dravanian Forelands","s":5209}}]}
