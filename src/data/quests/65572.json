In recognition of your service to the moogle delivery service, the honor of delivering this day's batch has been awarded to you. Franz is training for an upcoming Coliseum match and can likely be found at the Gladiators' Guild in Ul'dah.","A popular gladiator must contend with threats both inside and outside the Coliseum─a truth which becomes apparent when a morbol seedling emerges from one of the missives addressed to Franz. The gladiator's comrades suspect one of their own, a former noxius named Langloisiert, may be responsible, but their lanista, Bubudoga, is convinced that other gladiators are responsible. Bubudoga also believes that the culprits may attempt to masquerade as fans to gain access to Franz and do him harm. Therefore, the lanista bids you surreptitiously investigate fans in the Coliseum and on the Steps of Nald by first posting placards and distributing flyers and then observing their reactions.","Gladiatorial combat attracts an eclectic crowd, but none you encounter appear to bear Franz ill will. Nevertheless, there is a nervous energy in the air which cannot be put down to mere pre-match excitement, and you feel eyes upon you on several occasions. Whether or not these observations will serve to satisfy Bubudoga remains to be seen.","After learning that the bundle you delivered contained a score of threatening letters, Silent Moss and U'linbho decided to go and look after Franz. While you await their return, Bubudoga would have you continue your covert surveillance of the Coliseum by acting as his representative and extending a warm /welcome to the more prestigious patrons, starting with Lady Genevieve just outside the Gladiators' Guild.","U'linbho's anguished scream from the Steps of Nald cuts your conversation with the Lady Genevieve short. Rush to her aid and see what has given her cause to cry out.","Before being felled by a sharp blow from behind, the Miqo'te observed Franz making his way towards Emerald Avenue, and Langloisiert following him at a distance. Convinced that the Duskwight is plotting to do Franz harm, she implores you to pursue Langloisiert and stop him before it is too late.","It would seem that U'linbho was too quick to presume malicious intent on the part of Langloisiert. The former noxius had long made a habit of watching over Franz, for fear of his rivals attacking in reprisal. Alas, on this occasion, Langloisiert and Silent Moss were unable to subdue the masked gladiators stalking Franz, and the two wounded companions bid you protect their beauteous comrade in their stead. Seek out Franz and his pursuers in central Thanalan.","The masked gladiators are unprepared to fend off another protector, and you have no difficulty besting them. All that remains is to confirm the condition of the fair-faced Franz.","Are we truly deserving of the accolades we receive? Franz the Fair had begun to ask himself this very question. Fearing that his fame was the product of Syndicate machinations, the young gladiator goaded his less scrupulous opponents to attack him outside the Coliseum, so that he might at last learn whether or not his reputation was legitimate. Now aware of his secret intentions, his comrades scold him for doubting the validity of his accomplishments, and convince him that the prince of the bloodsands, the pride of Ul'dah, the suave southern dandy is anything but a fraud. The party subsequently departs for their upcoming match, after which they will return to Halatali, where they will eagerly welcome you should you choose to join their training."],"objectives":["Deliver the stack of letters to Franz at the Gladiators' Guild.","Hand out the Coliseum flyers on the Steps of Nald.","Post the Coliseum placards inside the Coliseum.","Speak with Bubudoga at the Gladiators' Guild.","Extend Genevieve a warm /welcome.","Aid U'linbho on the Steps of Nald.","Search for Langloisiert.","Search for Franz in central Thanalan.","Speak with Franz."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LETTERMOOGLE","text":"Have I got an assignment for you, kupo!

Think I'll have a drink afore we go to work."},{"name":"ULINBHO","text":"Come now, ya have to admit that was awfully suspicious! Are ya sure Lang ain't behind the threats? He's obviously jealous of Franz's popularity!"},{"name":"SILENTMOSS","text":"I will not attempt to speak to his feelings.

He may have since “paid” his dues, but how far can we trust a man such as he?"},{"name":"BUBUDOGA","text":"After running afoul of the Brass Blades some time ago, Langloisiert was declared a <span class=\"emphasis\">noxius</span>.

If these fiends detest Franz as much as I believe, your actions may drive them to reveal their intent."},{"name":"BUBUDOGA","text":"Or perhaps, like the others, you think Langloisiert responsible? I think not, and for one unassailable reason: Langloisiert was once condemned to the Marasaja Pit for ghastly, violent crimes. It was that selfsame propensity for violence which saw him declared a noxius and earned him his freedom.<br>If truly he wished to do Franz harm, he would be far more direct, I should think."},{"name":"SILENTMOSS","text":"Men are not wont to change, particularly when they continue to be rewarded for their faults."},{"name":"ULINBHO","text":"On the bloodsands?

One of the bastard's partners must've cracked me on the head from behind. Still can't see straight, but I saw well enough."},{"name":"ULINBHO","text":"Franz was walking towards Emerald Avenue, and Lang was following him at a distance..."},{"name":"ULINBHO","text":"How could he!?

Did the girl take a tumble an' bash her noggin?"},{"name":"SILENTMOSS","text":"We were wrong, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">postwoman</span><span class=\"alternative\">postman</span></span>.

'Course, he's a slippery one an' often gets away."},{"name":"SILENTMOSS","text":"Credit for this particular failure goes not to Franz, though. The gladiators noticed our presence. We were unprepared, and there were too many innocents."},{"name":"LANGLOISIERT","text":"Sod it. I ain't makin' excuses."},{"name":"LANGLOISIERT","text":"All's I wanted to do was keep him safe.
