Need I remind you I'm one of the finest hunters this tribe has ever seen? And speak for yourself! I don't remember you being a master culinarian!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...How long has it been since we saw Father? Maybe Alphinaud and I ought to visit Sharlayan."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"So if your mother's food is so good, why are you such a terrible cook? Honestly, you've got to get her to teach you the basics while we're here."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I trust you are well rested and refreshed, yes? Then let us return to the front."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The greater part of the Alliance forces should have advanced into the Peaks by now, but I expect we will pass many of our comrades on the road east."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"There is a checkpoint along the way, as I recall, but we will need only to identify ourselves to the soldiers in order to pass."},{"name":"ALLIEDRECRUIT","text":"Scions! A pleasure to have you with us again."},{"name":"ALLIEDRECRUIT","text":"You'll be happy to hear we've taken Ala Ghiri, and have already begun fortifying it as our new base of operations in the Peaks. Give a shout to the lads as you pass, eh?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"The imperials sure do like their towers, don't they?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"My village─the one we visited with Meffrid─is far to the north.

Very good, very good..."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"Enjoy your time with M'naago and her kin? Aye, that's what I want to hear. Too many soldiers forget the importance of time away from all this."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"On behalf of the Elder Seedseer, I thank you for your swift and decisive action against the primal menace. We are not unaware of the danger it posed to our fair nation."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"The imperials underestimated us once, and they paid dearly for it. They may not be so easily deceived next time─but if we cannot fool them, we will simply have to break them!"},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"As you can see, this part of the Peaks is much higher than the northern reaches, hence why the imperials built Specula Imperatoris where they did."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"See those three towers to the east? That's her. Sits right on the edge of a cliff, so attacking from the north is a fool's errand. From the south, on the other hand, she's no different from any other imperial installation."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"You see now why Velodyna was so important, eh? Right, then. Come along─they're waiting for us in Ala Ghiri."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"The settlement is remarkably intact. I see little evidence of fighting..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Ala Ghiri's famous for that giant crystal. Some say Rhalgr Himself put it there."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Ala Ghiri was once a hub of trade and commerce, as I recall, hence the need for a large central square."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"Here we are.

I see you have been quite busy in our absence."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Less than you may imagine. The imperials fled at our coming, and we took the village without a fight."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Your timing is impeccable. We were about to discuss our strategy to seize Specula Imperatoris."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Though we are fresh from the road, we should be glad to attend."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Good.
