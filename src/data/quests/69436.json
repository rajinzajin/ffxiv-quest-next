{"quest":{"name":"Chief Concerns","location":"Lakeland","id":69436,"patch":5.3,"sort":5,"icon":100999,"beast":14,"unlocksFunction":1,"eventIcon":71341,"issuer":1033710,"target":1033710,"genre":60,"usedItems":[31144,31145],"journal":["There once was a dwarf named Ronitt<br>A boy with a bee in his bonnet.<br>He had agreed to a bet<br>He would come to regret,<br>Unless, of course, he actually won it.","The wager with Chief Xamott has prompted several Tholls to return to Tomra for fear of banishment in the event that Ronitt fails. He must produce five Rolling Tankards by the designated day, which is becoming increasingly unlikely as his workforce diminishes. He decides to take a stroll, ostensibly to clear his head, but through a rather obvious attempt at reverse psychology, he strongly implies that he wants you to follow him.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Ronitt's plan to lure you away from the Anvil has worked, and he can now air his concerns without the other dwarves overhearing. He reveals that he is finding the burden of responsibility too much to bear, and turns to you for advice. Your words of wisdom soon lift his spirits, but it is the surprise arrival of Regitt, Karutt, and Ronitt's dwarven relations protocol automaton, the Megasonic Frogboy, that make the biggest difference. While his friends offer their support, the Frogboy provides Ronitt with a hint as to how they might turn their fortunes around.","Back at Watts's Anvil, you are met by Ozogg, who had briefly disappeared in order to round up acquaintances of Ronitt's to assist with producing the tanks. Ronitt also has plans of his own, though he will wait until all of the pieces of the puzzle are in place before revealing exactly what those plans might be.","You are presented with an opportunity to flex your crafting muscles once more. Ronitt asks you to produce yet another crate of essential supplies while he and his comrades take care of the rest.","The Fetchomatic Mechatoad, infallible as always, produces from its metallic belly the materials required for your work. By your dexterous hands they will be reborn as essential components in...whatever it is that Ronitt's unfathomable genius has conjured up.","After a flurry of activity, Ronitt's latest creation is completed. He has incorporated his existing automaton technology into a mechanized factory, which he claims will increase the speed at which the remaining tanks may be produced. While this does raise the question of how exactly this was a more effective use of time and resources than simply repeating the steps used to create the prototype, it seems the general consensus is to go along with Ronitt's schemes, regardless of how absurd they may be.<br><br>The newly constructed automated factory whirs into life and the tanks approach completion. However, the day of reckoning has arrived, and it appears that Ronitt's efforts may have been too little, too late. Ozogg believes there is no other option but to delay the arrival of Chief Xamott to allow Ronitt time to finish his work before final judgment can be passed.","Ozogg intends to slow the advance of Chief Xamott by placing kegs of nitrobrew, a ludicrously potent alcoholic beverage, in his path. Knowing that dwarves cannot say no to a drink, she hopes that it will incapacitate him for long enough to allow Ronitt to put the finishing touches to the tanks. She tasks you with positioning the barrels, and while it is unclear why she needs your cooperation in the first place, time is of the essence, so you decide not to argue.","With the kegs of nitrobrew now in place, you must return to Ozogg's hiding place and await the arrival of Chief Xamott. With no idea of exactly when he is supposed to make his appearance, you may be here for some time.","Chief Xamott arrives as predicted, although he is for some reason accompanied by his archrival, Chief Glagg of the Gogg. Presumably, he has come expecting to see Ronitt fail the challenge and to admonish Ozogg for her involvement. Instead, they find themselves distracted by the allure of a powerful ale, prompting them to collapse into a drunken stupor. Though the limits of their dwarven constitution are sorely tested, they eventually awaken, and Ronitt is still nowhere to be seen. Xamott is ready to declare the wager has come to an end when Ronitt and his column of five tanks trundle onto the scene, much to the relief of you and Ozogg. Xamott congratulates Ronitt on passing the test, which he then uses as an opportunity to regale those in attendance with the tale of the great Watts.<br><br>It seems that the Tholl and Gogg were once part of the same tribe, and it was disputes over how best to use Watts's automata that caused the schism between them. His remaining designs were locked away, only for Ronitt to open the safe generations later using a coin given to him as a child by none other than Ozogg. This coming together of Tholl and Gogg may very well mark a turning point in the history of the two tribes, though only time will tell. Xamott and Glagg bid their farewells while the rest of you return to the Anvil.","The day is won, but Ronitt is not one to rest on his laurels. He knows full well that it will take more than five tanks to ease the world's woes, so he proposes that production continue. While the workshop is now fully outfitted with an automaton workforce, Ronitt still has need of your crafting talents in manufacturing the next batch of Rolling Tankards."],"objectives":["Speak with Ronitt.","Speak with Ronitt again.","Speak with Ronitt...with gusto!","Obtain materials from the Fetchomatic Mechatoad.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize [Error]</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver [Error] to Ronitt</span></span>.","Speak with Ozogg.","Place the kegs of nitrobrew at the designated locations.","Speak with Ozogg.","Speak with Ronitt."],"dialogue":[{"name":"RONITT","text":"I've got some bad news and some more bad news.

At this rate, we'll never make it!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"...As for the other bit of bad news, some of the workers have turned tail and ran back to the village before they get in any more trouble! Now, there ain't enough people to handle production or bring in raw materials!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Regitt, Karutt, and the others are already at their breakin' point. I even thought about askin' Ozogg for help, but I can't bloody find her!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Think, Ronitt, think! There must be a way! Maybe a nice, relaxin' stroll will clear my head."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Yeah, a quick trip to scenic Dampsole should sort me right out. And whatever you do, don't follow me! Even if you think I might get eaten by hungry beasties, don't follow me. Yes, definitely don't do that."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Ronitt definitely does not want you to follow him to Dampsole."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Haha! I see you understood my subtle hints!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"You see, I wanted a word with you, away from the others. It's a bit of a touchy subject, and I don't want 'em gettin' discouraged or nothin'."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"You're good at keepin' secrets, ain't you?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Phew... All right. Truth is, I'm findin' it all a bit much. The pressure, the responsibility. I've always been a loner, and nothin' I ever did made a lot of difference to anyone else."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Whereas it seems to me, you're the opposite. By the sounds of it, people are always turnin' to you for help. Don't you ever worry you'll make some sort of horrible mistake and...I dunno, cause the end of the world or somethin'?

Watts's Anvil ain't just a place, it's the people who make it what it is!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"So, what you're sayin' is I'm just scared of failure? You're damned right I am! ...But maybe if I concentrate on succeedin' instead of not failin', things should start goin' my way!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Thanks, I feel a lot better now. And with the great Watts's blood flowin' in my veins, there ain't nothin' I can't overcome!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"'Course, I've got Watts's hammer as well, thanks to you findin' it for me!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Not that I ever use it, mind you. I'm keepin' it safely hidden away until the day comes that I'm skilled enough to wield it myself. This thing? Just a normal, everyday hammer, mate. Nothin' special, but gets the job done."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Point is, it gives me somethin' to look forward to, a reason not to give up. Can't go disappointin' my illustrious ancestor now, can I?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Still, honin' my own skills is all well and good, but if I really wanna go down in the history books, I've gotta think big, think beyond what I'm capable of doin' on my own."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"And with friends like you, how can I go wrong?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Right, I'd better get back to the workshop before I run out of steam again. I've found my motivation, now all I need is a plan. Hmm... I wonder what Watts would do at a time like this. A shame his expertise was in automata and not tanks."},{"name":"AUTOMATON03900","text":"(-???-)&lt;beep&gt; Now all I need is a plan...<br>&lt;beep&gt; Automata..."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"The Megasonic Frogboy!

Come on, I'll show you what I have in mind!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"I'm gonna use this space to build somethin' that'll speed up production, but I can't do it all on my own."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"That reminds me, I thought Ozogg was supposed to be around here somewhere!"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"(-Ozogg-)Aw! Did you miss me?"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"Sorry to keep you waiting. I took the liberty of inviting a few friends of yours."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"I knew it was only a matter of time before you needed my help.

Really, considering all you've done for us, Master Ronitt, it would be our pleasure to assist you."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"You traveled all this way just to help me! Well, not you, Lorathia, you only live 'round the corner, but I'm grateful all the same! I'm so happy, I... I..."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"&lt;sniff&gt; All right! There's plenty of work to be done and not much time to do it!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"As for you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, just because all these people have shown up doesn't mean you're off the hook!"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"When I agreed to let you lot use my land, I had no idea the place would end up like <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span>."},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"And to think it would be used to build the very same cannons I designed for the Crystarium. Sometimes I feel that life is a series of bizarre coincidences. Or is that what people call fate?"},{"name":"EUELISS","text":"If there's one thing the people of Wright know about, it's producing alcohol, so imagine our surprise when we learned that Ronitt's tanks use ethanol for fuel. It seems Sai-Lewq and I will be making a greater contribution than we'd thought!"},{"name":"SAILEWQ","text":"I've made plenty of alcohol in my time, but never any strong enough to be used as fuel! Well, not intentionally, that is! Say, this could be a new avenue of business for Wright..."},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"I wonder if I'll still be able to carry on engineering when I'm Lorathia's age?"},{"name":"LORATHIA","text":"Oi! I'll have you know, I've got more than a few good years left in me! "},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Time to put my plan into action. By usin' a load of existin' automaton parts, I'll be able to upgrade the workshop and build the rest of tanks, even with just this small number of us."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Still, there are a few things that need to be made from scratch, and I've got a whole crate's worth of parts I want you to make.

There's not a moment to spare!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"With the day of reckoning looming ever closer, Ronitt has decided that it would be quicker to construct an entire factory, complete with automaton workers, than build four tanks identical to the one he has already completed, but Ronitt's mind moves in mysterious ways."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"For what Ronitt lacks in effective time management he more than makes up for with sheer stubbornness in the face of overwhelming odds. Perhaps this is what has earned him the respect and loyalty of his ragtag collection of friends?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"And yet, in spite of Ronitt's efforts, time refused to slow, heartless bastard that it is."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Then, the fateful day arrived..."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"The chief'll be here any moment, and I still have one more tank to finish!"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I have an idea!

I'm not used to all this running about! Here, take this."},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"It's nitrobrew, an alcoholic beverage that doubles as paint stripper, and it's strong enough to knock out a bison.

Have you any idea what you've put us through!?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Did I say “<span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> hard-earned victory”? Of course, what I meant to say was “<span class=\"emphasis\">our</span> hard-earned victory”! Yes, yes! A slip of the tongue, that's all! I-Is...that any better?"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Well, Ronitt. You did it, fair and square. No underhanded, dirty tricks. At least none that I'm aware of."},{"name":"GLAGG","text":"Ozogg! Though I have yet to decide your punishment for consortin' with Tholls, I will say this: you have demonstrated the superiority of Gogg engineerin', without which, those tanks would never have seen the light of day!"},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"Listen, Chief. I didn't do this because I'm a Gogg, I did this because I'm a member of Watts's Anvil, so stick that in your pipe and smoke it!"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"All this talk of Tholl and Gogg has reminded me of somethin' important."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"We don't often talk about this, but when I were a lad, my chief once told me that Tholl and Gogg were once part of a single tribe."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"And into that one tribe was born a boy. His name...was Watts. He was blessed with curiosity and imagination in abundance, and grew up to become the greatest inventor our kind has ever known."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"But sadly, the automata that he created caused a rift in our people. Some wanted to use them as workers, while others saw them as tools of war."},{"name":"GLAGG","text":"Pah! And we all know how that ended. The limp-bearded Tholls, content to dig their holes and till their soil, and the mighty Goggs crushing their enemies and sowing the fields with their blood! Glory to Komra!"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"A pox on Komra!"},{"name":"GLAGG","text":"A pox!? Is that the worst you Tholls can muster!?"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Stop squabblin', the pair of you! I wanna hear the rest of the story!"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Ah, yes, as I was saying... Watts was beside himself to think that his beloved inventions could lead to so much strife. He locked away the rest of his designs, so that they could never bring harm to his fellow dwarves."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"And those designs included the tank... It all makes sense now. No wonder he didn't want no one findin' 'em. But if I hadn't opened that safe, somebody else would've eventually."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"How did you open it, anyway? It was locked tight!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Erm... Well, it was a long time ago, so I ain't quite sure, but I remember I used a coin. One given to me by a Gogg, I think."},{"name":"OZOGG","text":"Ah! That coin! It's the one I gave you!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Eh!? You mean you're that Gogg girl, from all those years ago!?"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Maybe this is how Watts planned it all along... His descendants, workin' side by side."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"It weren't the technology what were at fault. It was us dwarves and our bickerin' what caused us to live apart as Tholl and Gogg. But now, one of Watts's ideas might build a bridge between us..."},{"name":"GLAGG","text":"Oh, shut up, you daft sod! You think this is all it takes to wash away generations of bad blood!? Pah! ...But on the other hand, we Goggs admire Watts just as much as you Tholls. If you're right─which would be a first─it's worth some thought."},{"name":"GLAGG","text":"Trouble is, it all seems a little <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> convenient. The coin, the chance reunion, all the other coincidences, and there are probably a load more I don't even know about!"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”<br>You see, all the coincidences in the world won't do you no good if you ain't got the gumption to make the most of 'em. Somethin' Ronitt and Ozogg have in spades."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Right, that's enough blatherin' out of me. I'm off for a pint at the Crystarium on my way home."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"And if you two think this is the end, think again! Five tanks is just the start. It'll take more'n that to solve the world's troubles!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"All right, I hear you. Now, bugger off and let us get on with it."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"That's funny... I thought those two were enemies. Probably got more in common than they realize. Anyway, it's time we got back to the Anvil!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"So you an' Ozogg bought me some time, did you? Should've bought a bit more by the sounds of it!"},{"name":"RONITT","text":"Heh, just jokin'. If it weren't for you two, I'd never have made it. I s'pose that's what Watts's Anvil is all about: you lot workin' your arses off to make me look good. Somethin' like that, anyway."},{"name":"RONITT","text":"But it's like the chief said, a measly five tanks ain't gonna right the world's wrongs. So, I reckon...five hundred ought to do it! We'd better get back to work, an' no slackin'!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have achieved <span class=\"highlight\">Sworn</span> reputation with Watts's Anvil."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You will receive an experience point bonus upon completion of the dwarf tribal daily quests."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Furthermore, you now have access to a wider selection of wares from Mizutt."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Normal-quality items crafted in the course of this quest serve no purpose and cannot be sold.
