However, something about the hunter's attitude fills Loupard with trepidation, and he has asked you to look after Q'yantaa once more. Speak with Bauricoin and make sure Q'yantaa will be safe with her new partner.","While Bauricoin's rude and arrogant temperament rubs both you and Q'yantaa the wrong way, Q'yantaa is determined to show him that she is much more than the naive novice that he thinks she is. Speak with Q'yantaa at the northwestern camp to see where this hunt will lead.","You arrive at the encampment at the agreed-upon time, but Bauricoin is nowhere to be found. Q'yantaa will keep a diligent eye out from her post─search the surrounding area for any signs of the haughty hunter.","You find Bauricoin hunched over a lifeless chocobo with an arrow through its neck, and nearby you see a tragic sight: unhatched chocobo eggs. Bauricoin claims credit for this grisly deed, and seems unfazed by this brazen affront to the rules of Tailfeather, declaring that he will bring his catch back to the camp on his own. Hurry and inform Q'yantaa of this tragic turn of events.","Q'yantaa can barely contain her rage as you recount the story of Bauricoin to her, showing a surprising amount of compassion for the wild chocobos. She will hurry back to Tailfeather to inform Loupard of Bauricoin's infraction of the camp's long-standing rules. Follow her back to the camp to watch the drama unfold.","Loupard is disgusted at Bauricoin's selfish and deplorable actions, summarily exiling him from Tailfeather. Although the search for Q'yantaa's partner must begin anew, the forests of the Dravanian forelands are a bit safer thanks to the strict rules of its chocobo hunters."],"objectives":["Speak with Bauricoin.","Meet with Q'yantaa.","Search for Bauricoin.","Report to Q'yantaa.","Speak with Loupard."],"dialogue":[{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Loupard called me over here just before I was gonna head out. Hmmm... I wonder if he has a new partner for me?"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Ah, you're both here right in time. I've made the acquaintance of another hunter that's lookin' for a partner, and took the liberty of puttin' Q'yantaa's name forward."},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"His name's Bauricoin, and though he's only been here but a short while, he's built quite a reputation for himself. He should be over near the storehouse. Why don't you go ahead an' make your acquaintances?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Finally, someone worth hunting with! Let's not waste any time!"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I couldn't say this to Q'yantaa, but somethin' about this hunter has me feelin' uneasy. Look after the two of 'em an' make sure nothin' goes amiss."},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Q'yantaa's gettin' more confident, but I'd feel more at ease if you'd look after her, an' make sure everythin' works out with this new hunter."},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"He doesn't seem very friendly..."},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"Hmmm? What do you want?"},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"...A partner? Ah... I remember that fool Loupard going on about something like that. So, you're the greenhorn he sent along?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"No, over here! Q'yantaa's the name, and I'll have you know I've already caught <span class=\"emphasis\">one</span> chocobo, so I'm hardly new to this!"},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"Hmph. Loupard has some nerve, sending me an untrained child. Can you even nock that bow? Very well, prove yourself in the hunt and maybe I'll let you carry the chocobo back."},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"Meet at the northwest camp. You <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> know where that is, yes?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Wh-Who does he think he is!? I'm a <span class=\"emphasis\">hunter</span>, not some craven child! We'll see who catches a chocobo!"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"He sure talked big, but I don't see him anywhere. Hmph, some hunter! If you spy any traces of him, let me know."},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Where in the seven hells is he?"},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"...Oh, it's you. So you do her searching for her too? ...What's that? As you can see, I had good reason to delay my arrival. A hunter would keep his own mother waiting if he caught prey in his sights."},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"I felled this chocobo with a single arrow. And what's more, there's a bountiful nest of eggs as well!"},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"Hahaha! With one arrow my fortune grows! You go tell that little girl this is what <span class=\"emphasis\">real</span> hunting is. I'll take my catch back to Tailfeather─alone."},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"Mwahaha! This chocobo will fetch a hefty price─to say nothing of the unhatched eggs!"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"...What, you found him? And he...<span class=\"emphasis\">killed</span> a chocobo!?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"...He even took the eggs? You don't mean to say...he killed a brooding chocobo!?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Loupard will wanna hear about this. I'll hurry back to Tailfeather!"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"To kill a chocobo as she sits caring for her eggs... He's got no right to call himself a hunter!"},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"What're you all giving me that look for? Not enough eggs for you!?"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Q'yantaa here's told me everythin'...it's a bloody mess of a story."},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"You killed a defenseless chocobo while she was caring for her eggs! You've no right to be among us hunters!"},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"Hmph, a child dares to lecture <span class=\"emphasis\">me</span> on hunting? That bird was just sitting on eggs that're mine by rights!"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Bauricoin... I ain't got the words to express my disgust. I can't stop you from huntin' how you like, but you'll no longer be welcome at Tailfeather."},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"What!? You're going to exile a hunter for <span class=\"emphasis\">hunting</span>!? Who gives a damn where a chocobo's laying its arse!?"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"All the hunters know the rules of the camp, and you ain't got the privilege to be excluded from them. Leave Tailfeather within the next bell or you're liable to be hunted yourself!"},{"name":"BAURICOIN","text":"You... What kind of piss-poor hunters are you!? A golden chocobo'd be sitting on your lap and all you'd do is coddle it! I don't need the likes of you anyways!"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Apologies, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I should've known his sort the moment he came struttin' into camp. Well, looks like we're back on the hunt for a partner.
