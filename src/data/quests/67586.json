Speak with the botanist at Camp Cloudtop and inquire after the particulars.","Basyle explains to you his latest dilemma: in order to maintain soil fertility, he wishes to grow crops of the bean family at regular intervals. However, such varieties of beans as are found in Coerthas refuse to grow in the Sea of Clouds. Based on your recommendation, Basyle asks you to return to Gridania to trouble Fufucha for advice.","Fufucha believes that the Shroud vetch would be best suited to Basyle's needs. Even so, she does not think it entirely ideal, and suggests that you find another strain with which to cross it and create a new variety. To this end, you must seek the counsel of a specialist─an Ishgardian native versed in local flora. During her time in Ishgard, Mujih may have come to know of such an individual; seek the reporter out at the aetheryte plaza in Foundation.","Most fortuitously, Mujih knows just the person you are looking for─the foremost herbalist in Ishgard, a man named Martineau. She offers to arrange a meeting with him, and instructs you to go to Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral, where he will supposedly be.","Having marveled at the fine specimens of Shroud vetch, Martineau gives you his recommendation for a crossing match: emerald beans, which can be harvested from lush vegetation in the Churning Mists. Procure ten handfuls of these beans and deliver them to Basyle.","Basyle receives the Shroud vetch and emerald beans with thanks. Though it will require time and effort to cross them, he believes that it will be worthwhile in the end. In parting, he informs you that Mujih has left a message asking you to meet her at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard.","With great satisfaction, Mujih informs you that the second installment in her series is on its way to <span class=\"emphasis\">The Raven</span>. She praises you for your part in Basyle's recent successes, and bids you keep up your efforts.<br><br>※The next botanist quest will be available from Mujih Mewrilah upon reaching level 58."],"objectives":["Speak with Basyle at Camp Cloudtop.","Speak with Fufucha at the Botanists' Guild.","Speak with Mujih Mewrilah at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard.","Speak with Martineau in Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Harvest emerald beans in the Churning Mists</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the emerald beans and Shroud vetch to Basyle at Camp Cloudtop</span></span>.","Report to Mujih Mewrilah at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Ah, I was hoping you'd come by!

I'm pleased to report that the cyclops onions are coming along nicely."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"This time, I need your help to maintain soil quality. As you know, soil gradually becomes barren with continued cultivation."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"In order to keep it fertile, we normally grow crops of the bean family at regular intervals."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Alas, such beans as we have in Coerthas refuse to grow here. Unless we do something, I fear the soil will cease to yield crops altogether. Is there aught you can suggest?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you suggest?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Try growing a Gridanian variety of beans."},{"name":"A1","text":"Request seeds from the Botanists' Guild."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"But of course! We've managed to grow gysahl greens from Gridanian seeds─perhaps this success can be repeated with beans."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"But of course! The Botanists' Guild has a veritable treasure trove of seeds from all regions. There's bound to be something among them that will grow in these parts."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"I'm sorry to trouble you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but could you please travel to Gridania and consult Fufucha? If anybody knows a strain of beans to suit our needs, it will be she."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Could you please travel to Gridania and consult Fufucha?

Aye, I have read all about your recent exploits in <span class=\"emphasis\">The Raven</span>. You have been away only a short while, and already you have achieved so much! We all of us here are very proud of you!"},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"...Oh? Embellished? Well, I suppose that is simply the way of Mujih's profession. And though her words may have been flowery, I choose to believe that they are firmly rooted in truth."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"In any case, all seems to be well with you, and for that I am glad. Now then, was there something you wished to talk about?"},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Hmmm... Cover crops for revitalizing soil, and those that will grow in the Sea of Clouds besides... This is a difficult order to fill."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"From my experience, I would say that Shroud vetch would be best suited. Even so, it is not entirely ideal."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Nay, it must be crossed with a highland strain to create what Basyle needs."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Now, rather than crossing strains haphazardly, I suggest you seek the counsel of a specialist─that is, an Ishgardian native versed in the local flora."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Show to him this bundle of Shroud vetch, and he should be able to provide you with the name of a suitable match."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"As to where you might find such an individual, I daresay Mujih will be the best person to ask. It is her business to know people, after all."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"I daresay Mujih will know of an Ishgardian specialist versed in the local flora. You would do well to speak with her."},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"...Fufucha suggested that you come to me? Ooh, she's a sharp one!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Indeed, it's my business to know people, and I happen to know just the person you're looking for!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Martineau is his name, and he's no less than the foremost herbalist in all of Ishgard! I'll arrange a meeting right away!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Actually, I wonder if it's appropriate to intervene in the doings of my subject...

And being a researcher, I welcome the insights of gatherers like your good self. But come, I am given to understand you seek advice on crossing strains of beans."},{"name":"MARTINEAU","text":"I had always held the Botanists' Guild in the highest regard. Seeing such fine specimens serves to reaffirm that sentiment."},{"name":"MARTINEAU","text":"As Mistress Fufucha has already concluded, the Shroud vetch will not prosper in the Sea of Clouds. It must needs be crossed with another strain to bring out its resilience."},{"name":"MARTINEAU","text":"I would recommend emerald beans, a rare strain which grows in the Churning Mists. For your purposes, you will need perhaps ten handfuls."},{"name":"MARTINEAU","text":"And with that, I trust you now know what is required. Should you have further questions, do not hesitate to seek me out again."},{"name":"MARTINEAU","text":"For your purposes, you will need perhaps ten handfuls of emerald beans. Should you have further questions, do not hesitate to seek me out again."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Miss Mujih tells me you managed to get Master Martineau's advice, even though he's notoriously elusive. You truly are dedicated to our cause, my friend."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Ah, so these are emerald beans! If I understand correctly, the plan is to cross these with Shroud vetch. Do you have the latter as well?"},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Marvelous! My thanks, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I shall set about cross-pollinating them at once!"},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"The process will require considerable time and effort, but I'm confident that it will be worthwhile in the end."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Ah, before I forget, Miss Mujih left a message for you.
