Your guide, she says, will be Sicard's allegedly “dear” acquaintance, Lord Emmanellain de Fortemps, who awaits your arrival even now with his usual enthusiasm and panache. After gazing at the progress you have made thus far in reconstructing Tataru's necklace, you heft two sacks of her finest work over your shoulder, and set off towards the snowy peaks of Ishgard.","Emmanellain's warm welcome helps belay the Pillars' frankly frigid temperatures. The young lord proudly announces that your first client is Lady Laniaitte of the Rose Knights, whom he himself holds in particular esteem, to put it lightly. Sincerely hoping you are not a simple accessory to his exercises in courtship, you make for the Rosehouse in Cloudtop while Emmanellain finishes his obligatory primping.","Lady Laniaitte gratefully accepts your bag of samples, and begins to tell you of a recent problem plaguing the islands, when Emmanellain makes his grand appearance bedecked in armor gifted─or, more accurately, stolen─from his dear friend Sicard. Immune to his antics, Laniaitte encourages him to act with decorum towards your next client, who is revealed to be none other than the infamous sky pirate crew the Redbills. This news gives Laniaitte pause, as marauding sky pirates are the very problem she had been speaking of earlier, but Emmanellain assures her that the Redbills could not possibly be complicit in such gauche affairs as reckless pillaging. With a sparkle in his eye, the young Lord de Fortemps skips off towards the Redbill standard on Coldwind, and you follow in his wake, wondering what grand adventure must await you among the clouds.","The Redbills are happy and well─none more so than their leader Leofard, who chuckles over his successful plan to lure you out to the Parrock. True to your sneaking suspicion, he has an adventure in store that requires your quick thinking and a sack of one-of-a-kind samples (which you off-load from your shoulder). The Redbills are having their own sky pirate problems, it seems, having lost precious cargo to a gang of scrags calling themselves the “Monstrous Cockatoos.” The stolen parts are instrumental to reconstructing a most important airship, so your sky pirate friends have concocted a plan─a plan that will be further explained upon your attendance in Idyllshire, where the Cockatoos have taken refuge. Emmanellain flutters back to the Rosehouse to apprise Lady Laniaitte of the situation, and you make your way to Dravania, shoulders conspicuously lighter, but heart pounding with anticipation.","The plan is simple as it is clever─you and Leofard will disguise yourselves as a shady merchant and <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> bodyguard, respectively, and canvas the town in search of hidden Cockatoos. Spread enough rumors of the coin to be made in the sale of stolen airship parts, and said airship parts will indubitably appear, or so the theory goes. Dressed in Stacia's best attempt at what a black market merchant looks like, and trying not to stare too enviously at the beautiful samples Leofard is sporting, the two of you set off to canvas the town.<br><br>※You must be accompanied by Leofard and wearing the black market merchant guise to complete this task. Speak with him should you become separated, or with Stacia to restore or prolong the guise.","After mongering rumors like a professional, Leofard grins conspiratorially at you and jerks his head to the side. The two of you drift away from the very prying eyes you have been courting to where your comrades wait in the shadows...","The Monstrous Cockatoos appear and predictably quail at the sight of a supremely ruffled Redbill Leofard. But their cockiness rallies as a surprising ally steps forward─Leofard's longtime rival Radlia, with a string of her Talons in tow. Proud and confident as ever, Radlia makes Leofard an offer she knows he can't refuse─his allegiance in exchange for those stolen airship parts─and for a moment, the comfortable smirk fades from Leofard's lips. Brusquely assuring Radlia that rebuilding his airship is more important than anything, he turns to the leading Cockatoo and accuses him of irreparably damaging the necessary pieces. Cockatoo denies this emphatically, unwittingly divulging the location of said cargo in the process, and the smirk is back in full force as Leofard contacts Utata via linkshell and relays the relevant coordinates. Having been outsmarted, and now facing <span class=\"emphasis\">the</span> <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span> in mortal combat, the Cockatoos bravely turn tail and Radlia admits her defeat.","Leofard, back in his own clothes, bids you return to the Parrock while he follows up with the Rose Knights regarding Cockatoo cleanup. You wait in Leofard's chambers and admire all his shiny baubles.","Thankfully, Utata managed to recover all the stolen cargo, and finishing touches on the airship proceed apace. Cait Sith is just wondering what is to become of the Cockatoos' trove when Tataru Taru, your favorite boss and coinkeeper, greets you from the threshold with a cheerful wave. Beside her stands an elderly man in a paint-flecked apron. Apparently, Leofard tasked her with finding this portraitist Duremert, who is not only the creator of a number of paintings found amongst the appropriated goods, but father of the late Lady Raimille, Leofard's adoptive mother. Regarding his grandfather with an expression obscured by his goggles but betrayed in his voice, Leofard announces that the successor to his airship─the next <span class=\"emphasis\">Raimille</span>─will be ready to take to the skies in no time.<br><br>After a healthy dose of adventure, a touching family reunion, and a few promising purrs from the brand-new <span class=\"emphasis\">Raimille</span>, you, Tataru, and Duremert are preparing your return to Ishgard, when a package of surprising heft falls from the sky. Leofard waves as he departs, and Tataru wonders aloud what sort of reward he must have left you. Equivocating as to its contents, you smile after your sky pirate friend, knowing he has gifted you the next piece of Tataru's necklace.","After listening to the tales of your various exploits, Duremert proclaims he feels awash with inspiration, and offers to compose portraits of your comrades and acquaintances in exchange for only the cost of supplies. While you would have him start work immediately, you must put your first commission on hold, as Mehdjina still awaits your return in Sharlayan.","Tataru has already filled Mehdjina in on the particulars, but you divulge the requisite missing piece to her story─the item Leofard left you. At first glance, it appears to be a simple-yet-ancient strip of leather, but Mehdjina soon recognizes it as an unbreakable Mhachi relic and perfect choice of chain for the reconstructed necklace. With the Rose Knights and Redbills secured as satisfied customers, Mehdjina is brimming with your collective success and cheerfully asks for your help in the further endeavors that await."],"objectives":["Wait at the designated location in Ishgard.","Speak with Laniaitte at the Rosehouse.","Travel to the Parrock.","Speak with Leofard in Idyllshire.","Speak with the residents of Idyllshire while in guise and accompanied by Leofard.","While in guise, accompany Leofard to the designated location and then speak with him.","Speak with Leofard.","Wait in Leofard's chambers.","Speak with Duremert.","Speak with Mehdjina in Old Sharlayan."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In order to undertake this quest, you must first complete the Shadow of Mhach quest series."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The starting quest, “Sky Pirates,” may be undertaken by speaking with the unquiet trader in Ishgard."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You may review your progress under “Chronicles of a New Era - The Shadow of Mhach” in your journal."},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"Why, hello there!

I ain't leavin' here without me stolen goods."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"...If they're worth recoverin', that is. You there, cockalorum─you didn't leave that plunder in wind-aspected territory, did you?"},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Of course you did. Head's as empty as a tosspot's tankard. Those airship parts are embedded with highly calibrated corrupted crystals. Put them in any contact with wind sprites and they're no better than glorified scrap."},{"name":"AIRPIRATE04650","text":"W-Wait a moment, he said “contact,” didn't he!? How many wind sprites go contactin' the rock formations on Provenance, eh? I-It'll be fine!"},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Utata, you've got hands on an airship, yes? Take her to Provenance and go pick up our stolen goods. Some genius hid them under a rock."},{"name":"RADLIA","text":"You were bluffing!?"},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Obviously</span>. Don't make me doubt your intelligence, Radlia─what airship needs parts that can't handle a little wind?"},{"name":"RADLIA","text":"...Doubt what you'd like, Leofard. I hardly need bloody airship bits to <span class=\"emphasis\">beat</span> you into submission!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Finally! It's beating time!"},{"name":"A2","text":"Let me slip into something more comfortable."},{"name":"RADLIA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!?"},{"name":"AIRPIRATE04650","text":"D-Did you say <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!? As in <span class=\"emphasis\">the</span> <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>!? Since when was <span class=\"emphasis\"><span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span></span> a friend of the Redbills!?"},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Seems I'm not the only one whose name is worth somethin' in these parts. ...I'm still prettier, though."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Well then, sweet Cockatoos! Let's get about cuttin' you up into Cockathrees and fours, shall we?"},{"name":"AIRPIRATE04650","text":"Redbill by himself is one thing─but <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s somethin' else."},{"name":"AIRPIRATE04650","text":"Ain't nothin' for it, lads!"},{"name":"AIRPIRATE04650","text":"Flee for your lives!!!"},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"So much for monstrous. Let's leave 'em to the garrison─ain't enough meat on their shiverin' bones to warrant the chase."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"...Radlia, Radlia. I reckon this was little more than a diversion to you, but surely you didn't think I'd fold to such a weak hand?"},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"All the more pity that you assumed those airship parts were the only pieces of value taken from me and mine."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"But no matter─it's time to make your allegiances clear. If you and your Talons intend to continue this farce, then we'll have it out, here and now. ...Well?"},{"name":"RADLIA","text":"...It seems I misjudged my prospects. I had thought those simpletons might amount to more than sniveling turn-tails, but I have neither loyalty nor affection for a useless Cockatoo."},{"name":"RADLIA","text":"I suppose I shall have to content myself with this reunion in itself. But you will need more than clever bluffs to evade me next time─of that you may be certain."},{"name":"CAITSITH","text":"While sky pirating may prove profitable, villainy shall not─may the Cockatoos ne'er forget the lessons learned this day!"},{"name":"STACIA","text":"We were standin' by in case you needed help, but I'm glad it didn't come to fisticuffs. Sounds like it's only a matter of time before Radlia tries her luck again, and gods only know what she has in mind..."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Those were some fine samples, without question─but nothin' beats wearin' me own rags again."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Go ahead to the Parrock and wait for us in my chambers. We'll be along once I've spoken with Our Knights Most Thorny."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"I just want to make certain those snivelin' Cockatoos have all had their wings clipped. We'll meet you back at the Parrock."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Well, Utata says all stolen property is accounted for and finishin' touches on our airship proceed apace."},{"name":"STACIA","text":"And accordin' to the Rose Knights, the Cockatoos will be shipped off to the Diadem, where they can enjoy volunteerin' their services for the betterment of mankind."},{"name":"CAITSITH","text":"...Speaking of which, Captain─what is to become of the miscellanea recovered from the Cockatoos' hoard? I am sure House Haillenarte will lay claim to their possessions, but as for the appurtenances of origins unknown..."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Worry not, puss─I don't pocket any jiggumbob I find like some petty foister. We'll track down their rightful places soon enough, if my prediction holds."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? Is that you!?"},{"name":"TATARU","text":"It is! And you look quite as surprised as I feel─to think we'd meet here, among the clouds! And sky pirates!"},{"name":"TATARU","text":"I was just finishing up my affairs in Idyllshire, when who should come asking for me but Redbill Leofard! Quite the thrilling twist to my day, I'll have you know."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"How did Emmanellain put it? “She's got her fingers in more pies than a high street baker”? When I got wind she was in Idyllshire, it felt like snubbin' fate not to enlist her expertise."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Well, I'm exceedingly glad you did, for I have returned triumphant! Allow me to present the famous traveling portraitist, Duremert!"},{"name":"CAITSITH","text":"...Portraitist? But of course! Among the recovered items were a number of singularly beautiful paintings..."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"Oh, I am relieved to hear it. When I learned which vessel had fallen prey to sky pirates, I thought those pieces would be lost forever..."},{"name":"CAITSITH","text":"So you are yet another victim of the Monstrous Cockatoos... Still, a personal summons to the Parrock seems like the sort of social nicety to which the captain is normally intolerant."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"I believe my presence here may have another purpose entirely. You see, Leofard and I are old acquaintances. He commissioned me to paint that portrait, in fact."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"My beautiful daughter Raimille. She looks perfectly at home here."},{"name":"CAITSITH","text":"Beautiful...daughter!?"},{"name":"STACIA","text":"Aye. Duremert is father to Lady Raimille, the gentlewoman who cared for Leofard as a lad."},{"name":"STACIA","text":"He abdicated all family affairs to his son when he became a practicing artist, but he's still a lord in lineage."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"You mean to say that the renowned portraitist Duremert is not only your grandfather, but a former lord as well!? Oh, you must forgive my blithe introduction from earlier..."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Naught to forgive, Mistress Taru. On the contrary, I'm indebted to you for trackin' him down so quickly. Thanks to you, this can happen just as I hoped it might."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Construction's about finished on our new airship, and I wanted you here when I christened her. The <span class=\"emphasis\">Raimille</span>...will fly again."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"My dear boy, celebrating your mother's life with you continues to be my great honor."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"When you hung her portrait here, when you named your first airship─I could see the vestiges of her love shining in your countenance then, just as it is now."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"I only hope you continue to realize her greatest wish for you─to live as free and unfettered as the sky itself. ...I know she would be very proud."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"A bit like herdin' coeurls, ain't it? Gettin' us adventurin' types all in one room. But well worth the effort, I'd say."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Moments like these are meant to be shared."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"...Right! I believe we've got a new airship to fly─and the open sky awaits!"},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Now <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span> is an airship... With how she handles, I could fly to the edge of existence and back without so much as a hiccup."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"...Which I hear on good authority─or whatever authority Emmanellain is when he's in his cups─you have <span class=\"emphasis\">literally</span> done. "},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"I reckon I've never been such equal parts awed and envious...though I'll assume me invitation was simply lost by a postmoogle."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"Nay, nay, in all candor─I'm certain there are some skies only meant for your eyes. Escapades surpassin' even my wildest imaginings."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"So chart the ends of eternity and horizons filled with peril. Just don't think you've seen the last of what wonders these heavens hold."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"I'll come find you again before long, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. And I'll bring everythin' I always promise─that thrilling, heady rush of high adventure!"},{"name":"CAITSITH","text":"Though farewell may be bitter sorrow, know that it is but fodder for reunions most gay."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"No need to get mawkish, furball. It ain't as if <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s droppin' off the face of the star. ...Not permanently, anyhow."},{"name":"STACIA","text":"We'll meet again soon enough. Although Cait Sith is liable to mope like a damp kitten till we do."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"I expect these parts will be free of half-baked brigands for a time yet, but should you ever find yourself in need of a Redbill, don't hesitate to call."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Thank you! 'Tis no small comfort knowing our ships may distribute their wares in safety."},{"name":"LEOFARD","text":"...As for you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─we'll be in touch."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Well, that was invigorating! While I'd love nothing more than to catch our collective breath over a cup of tea, business calls me to Ishgard. No rest for the enterprising and talented, as they say! Shall we, Duremert?"},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"Might I persuade you to accompany us? I should very much like to hear of your adventures."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"Painting subjects I find personally inspiring is a particular credo of mine, and I daresay you have brushed shoulders with more than a few individuals of note."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"Thank you for indulging an old man's eccentricities. Now then─perhaps you could begin with the adventures you shared with Leofard and his crewmates..."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Leofard <span class=\"emphasis\">intentionally</span> off-loaded this in our direction, yes? Whatever could it be...?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"A show of goodwill from the Redbills."},{"name":"A2","text":"Whatever it is, Leofard's a man of his word."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Oh, that's right! When Leofard spoke to me about finding Duremert, he did mention sending something along in thanks."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"How mysterious! But now that I think of it, Leofard <span class=\"emphasis\">did</span> mention sending something along when he asked me to track down Duremert."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Well, I would make quite the sight lugging this around to all my meetings, so might I ask you to hold on to it for the time being? I trust you not to run off with my share of the reward!"},{"name":"TATARU","text":"A gift from the notorious Redbills... You know, they're rather a <span class=\"emphasis\">nice</span> sort of sky pirate, don't you think?"},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"A bright and energetic young lady is your employer, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I hope shepherding me back to Ishgard did not delay her business overlong."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"The tales you shared on the journey here were beyond anything I could have anticipated. Never have I heard such inspiring episodes of derring-do."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"Though I may not know them personally, I find myself fascinated by the individuals you described─the comrades and acquaintances of your journeys. Yes, I believe I shall remain in the capital to paint for a time..."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"Should you desire a portrait, I would happily part with it for the cost of its supplies. Find me here, and we can make the arrangements."},{"name":"DUREMERT","text":"I look forward to taking up my brush. Let us speak again once you have fulfilled your current obligations."},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"Welcome back! I just received word from Mistress Tataru─what's this about portraitists and sky pirates!?"},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"Redbill Leofard gave you this? For the necklace?"},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"It seems to be a leather strap of sorts...and an antiquated one at that..."},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"...Wait a moment. I recognize this design from my studies! This...this is a relic of the ancient city of Mhach!"},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"It is said that Mhachi sorcerers would weave these cords with magicks to make them unbreakable. You'd be hard-pressed to find better material for a necklace!"},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"Oh, Mistress Tataru will be so delighted. She chatted endlessly about how pleased she was to know the Redbills and what sorts of products might prove useful to our daring new friends."},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"And the Rose Knights have already placed an order for the garrison, so all in all, I believe our latest endeavor was a brilliant success!"},{"name":"MEHDJINA","text":"As always, we shall be on the lookout for new areas of opportunity, so I hope we can count on you to serve as our charming emissary again─in fact, I believe Mistress Tataru will insist upon it! Until next time!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You may now purchase portraits from Duremert by speaking to him in Ishgard."}],"reward":{"gil":656},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":90,"id":1}],"quests":[70119]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1042599","obj":{"i":1042599,"n":"Mehdjina","l":3706,"q":3}},{"type":"quest","id":"70119","obj":{"i":70119,"n":"Small Business, Big Dreams","g":80,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":10}}]}
