All clues point to Lebrassoir de Bonfaurt being the culprit, but without evidence to support your suspicions, there is no way to absolve Archombadin of his perceived guilt. When all seems lost, Theomocent steps forth with a plan as to how he might obtain a confession from your suspect. He asks that you accompany him to Dzemael Manor, where both Archombadin and his fast friend have taken shelter.","Thanks to Theomocent's ingenious ploy, you manage to trick Lebrassoir into confessing to his crimes. He proudly reveals that, spurred by long-held grievances against House Dzemael, he was the one who set in motion the turmoil that has taken hold of the scholasticate. Funneling a portion of the Dzemael heir's inheritance towards financing Ulaa's kidnapping, he then stirred up the rumors that Archombadin was to blame, and distributed the letters to strike the proverbial final blow. Though you may have finally ascertained the truth, the hour of the hearing which will determine Archombadin's fate is at hand, and Theomocent fears that events might take a further twist. Quickly make your way to the deacon's quarters with Lebrassoir in tow, that the truth might be presented before the council and Archombadin cleared of the false charges.","Soon after Lebrassoir confesses to his crimes before the deacon and Father Saturnois, Briardien bursts in with Temple Knight guards at either side. Pointing his finger at the scholasticate priest, he tells you that it was Saturnois who manipulated Lebrassoir into carrying out his schemes and that he is not the man he claims to be. Having suffered for years isolated from the outside world, and forced to work for Her Holy Body of Decency as a watchman consigned to monitor the expurgators─a terrible fate reserved solely for orphans who graduate from the scholasticate and enter the Holy See─he had intended to create a scandal so large, the outrage it would spark in the community would force the scholasticate into closure. He believed the establishment's demise would right some of the wrongs committed against him and others like him. While Archombadin's name has been cleared and it is clear he will not be expelled, Saturnois' revelation causes the deacon to question if the school itself should remain open. At the behest of the students, however, she instead holds a public hearing and divulges to the people of Ishgard the terrible tragedy suffered by both expurgator and watchman. Having turned over a new leaf by speaking the truth, the residents of the scholasticate are hopeful that it will rekindle the people's faith in their institution.","Briardien bids you thanks along with all the students of the scholasticate and tells you he will be swinging by Ul'dah to see someone special before moving on to solve his next mystery. While there is no doubt the students are sad to see the both of you go, they send you off with heartfelt good-byes and promise you that when you next return to Ishgard, they will have seen to it that the scholasticate has retaken its place as the nation's top establishment of higher learning."],"objectives":["Speak with Archombadin.","Speak with the scholasticate deacon.","Speak with Theomocent in Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral."],"dialogue":[{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"I think I missed something.

The planting of the book in Archombadin's quarters and the subsequent distribution of these letters were both carried out to a common end: to implicate the prefect in Ulaa's abduction and force his expulsion. It would stand to reason that the perpetrators are either working in tandem or, in fact, are one and the same."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"While that, in itself, does not reveal the identity of the culprit, it does lead us to our next question: who would have been able to enter and exit Ulaa's room unnoticed?"},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"It seems you've missed the obvious.

I hear that you possess a great gift─one which you employed to reveal long-hidden truths about our nation. Might you not be able to use this power to shine some light on the matter at hand?"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"So it is not yours to control. &lt;sigh&gt; I guess that means we'll have need to rely on our own wits to obtain the answers we seek."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Fortunately, I have an idea of my own, but I'll need your help to see it through."},{"name":"CRAMMEVOIX","text":"Well then, Theo, let us put this idea of yours into action.

Let's make our way there posthaste."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"I'll leave it to you to see that the bumblings of those three do not interfere with the final stage of my investigation at the Vault."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"But do not tarry long.

What are we to do...?"},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"Again!?

If you have something to report, pray return later."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"Findings? Ha! As if anything you four managed to dig up can help me now. The hearing is about to begin─my fate is as good as sealed!"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"There's still time, Archombadin! Earlier you pledged your innocence to us. Let us pledge it once more─at the hearing, before one and all. The truth shall speak for itself!"},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"The <span class=\"emphasis\">truth</span>? You expect those fools to see the <span class=\"emphasis\">truth</span> when this...this <span class=\"emphasis\">evidence</span> to the contrary is staring them in the face! How do you think this plan your pea-sized minds have concocted will succeed where all Lebrassoir's best attempts have failed!?"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"We <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> succeed, Archombadin! For it is not just I that stands with you, but the hero who brought to light the truth behind our very nation! Yes, there is <span class=\"emphasis\">nothing</span> that <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> has not seen."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Surely <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> understand the implications of this.

And it was <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> that distributed the letters─all so that I might implicate Archombadin."},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"How satisfying it is to finally be able to say it aloud! For so long I have had to plot my revenge in silence, and mask my hatred of you with hollow praise and bashful smiles."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"Lebrassoir! Wh-What madness is this you speak!?"},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"You truly are oblivious, aren't you? Then allow me to enlighten you! After all the transgressions your family has committed against mine, did you truly think I would remain loyal to <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>?"},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"For centuries your house has humiliated us. It was something we'd come to accept, but when the wall between the nobility and the common class came tumbling down, we were met with the most harrowing truth of all: that all our suffering had been for naught!"},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"Everything we grew up believing about our status was a fabrication, tall tales spun to keep us complacent. In reality, you're no better than the two Brume rats beside you! You never were! It was a terrible realization, but one that also gave me hope─hope that you could be taken down just as any other."},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"That's when I began plotting. Ulaa's abduction, the letters and the rumors they spurred─all was part of my master plan! To bring shame and dishonor on you and your family, as you have mine."},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"I have staked everything─yes, even my very freedom! But it was worth it to give you a taste of our pain! Bahahaha!"},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"What's more, I bribed the two kidnappers into abducting Ulaa with money from your purse! And having entrusted the management of your finances to me, you never suspected a thing!"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Lebrassoir. I can only imagine the pain you have endured, but to seek revenge in this way...! Nevertheless, I thank you for confessing to your crimes. Now we can absolve Archombadin of the false charges brought against him."},{"name":"LEBRASSOIR","text":"W-Wait a minute! You mean that <span class=\"emphasis\"><span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span></span> didn't actually see into the past!? Y-You deceived me!"},{"name":"CRAMMEVOIX","text":"If you'll recall, Theo never explicitly said that <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> had a vision of what happened to Ulaa. He merely observed that <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> possesses such an ability."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Truth be told, it is not even a power that can be controlled at will."},{"name":"CRAMMEVOIX","text":"Now then, Archombadin, I suppose that's all the proof of innocence you'll need. Let's escort Lebrassoir to the hearing and have him repeat his most dramatic confession before the headmistress."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"I never saw it... The hatred, I mean. H-How could I have been so blind? We've been friends from childhood, and never for a moment did I question his loyalty..."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"What a fool I was! However did I think I could stand at the forefront of our nation, when I was so oblivious to that which was happening under my very nose!?"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Archombadin, pray do not torture yourself so. Rather, open your heart and allow Halone's wisdom to set you free. Once you come to see Lebrassoir not only as your friend but as your peer, I promise that the both of you will find a way to mend any bonds that have been broken."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"“Of the Fury's love will all men receive, and by the balance of Her spear will all be set free...” You truly believe these words, don't you? You cling to them even when reality does all it can to prove you wrong. I suppose it is that unwavering faith that your friends find so...endearing."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"Now then, it is time for me to put my own faith to the test, and face my fate head-on. May the Fury have mercy."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"So what are we waiting around here for? We've a hearing to attend!"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"I'll meet you two there. There is something I must confirm with the inspector first."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I cannot shake the feeling that this affair runs far deeper than any of us could have imagined. If you would, please accompany Archombadin to his hearing and see to it that nothing goes awry in my absence."},{"name":"ELVIANE","text":"I must say, Master Lebrassoir, that I am extremely disappointed. That anyone, much less a student of our upstanding establishment, would commit such atrocities...! I am truly at a loss for words."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"Headmistress Elviane, if I may. Do you not find the timing of these confessions to be incredibly convenient? It's as if Master Lebrassoir here has been coerced into admitting to crimes he himself didn't commit. Let us not rush to condemn a man who may very well be innocent."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"We must also keep in mind that this incident will have repercussions that extend beyond the scholasticate. Distrust of our church has never been so high."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"If we were to expel either one of our prefects, both of whom have strong ties to House Dzemael, we will lose any credibility our establishment still has in the eyes of the citizens."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"To this end, I would propose an alternative plan: we will make a full disclosure of this scandal to the public, together with an announcement that Saint Endalim's Scholasticate will be temporarily closed. It is past time we pushed for a full reformation of the school and its curriculum."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"(-Incisive Voice-)And there it is...the confession I've been waiting for!"},{"name":"ELVIANE","text":"Confession...? Master Briardien! Explain yourself!"},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"From the start, I had my suspicions that someone was pulling strings behind the scenes─someone who had secured a high enough position within the clergy to manipulate the students and the system. I pored through records, closely examining any who fit this description."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"It was no easy task, but I finally found what I was searching for. And combined with the confession Theomocent obtained from Lebrassoir, I was able to uncover the true culprit..."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"I speak of you, Saturnois! And I do not call you “Father,” for you are no priest! The documents admitting you into your current position were all forged."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">You</span> manipulated Lebrassoir into carrying out what you yourself could not. You stirred up discord among the students, and fomented the people's distrust of the clergy in the hopes of creating an even greater rift between the people of Ishgard and the clergy...all in the hopes of seeing the scholasticate closed down once and for all."},{"name":"CRAMMEVOIX","text":"B-But I don't understand. Why would Father Saturnois seek the ruin of the scholasticate?"},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"The answer to that would lie in his past. Over a decade ago, Saturnois graduated top of his class and was welcomed into the ranks of the Holy See. It was there, he was assigned work as an expurgator."},{"name":"ELVIANE","text":"Expurgator? What are you taking about? In all my years serving the Holy See, I've never heard of such a post."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"I would be more surprised if you had. Her Holy Body of Decency─a sector that is comprised of a few select individuals─is perhaps the best-kept of Ishgard's many secrets. Its existence is known only to a handful of people beside the archbishop himself."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"I am impressed, Master Briardien─it would seem your reputation is well deserved. Though I must correct you on one account. I am no expurgator, but rather one of the so-called “watchmen” consigned to guard them."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"That said, we shared a similar fate. Both expurgator and watchman alike were struck from official records and confined in the bowels of the Holy See─damned to live out our lives in the shadows as pallid husks of the men and women we could have been─all so that someday we might fulfill one task."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"Where written records were deemed too dangerous, expurgators would serve as living documents, orally passing down our nation's greatest secrets. When the time came for the archbishop's successor to ascend the throne, we would briefly emerge from our isolation to pass from our mouths to their ears all we knew of Ishgard before sinking back into obscurity."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"Of course, no highborn man or woman would be condemned to this fate. No, this was a destiny reserved for commoners─orphans with no ties to the world above."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"Seven hells... So if the truth hadn't come to light, Th-Theo and I..."},{"name":"ELVIANE","text":"Men and women forced to sacrifice their own lives, that our nation's darkest secrets might be preserved forever unbeknownst to her people... I can scarce believe my ears!"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Father Saturnois. The friend you spoke of..."},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"Yes...he was an expurgator. Such anguish did his duties cause him that he chose death over that wretched excuse for a life. And while a new era is upon us─one that does not condemn the innocent to a life of despair for the sake of one man─it does not undo the injustice of a thousand years!"},{"name":"SATURNOIS","text":"It was to right the wrongs of the past that I escaped that foul dungeon and made my way back to the place where it all began. This twisted institution─the place responsible for stealing the bright futures of young orphans─needs to be closed down for good."},{"name":"ELVIANE","text":"...Father Saturnois. Your actions are heinous, and I can in no way condone them. That said, if there is truth to what you say, perhaps it would be best for us to suspend all lessons until we can reach a consensus as to how we might proceed."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"B-But Headmistress Elviane! Would not closing down the scholasticate be akin to evading our responsibility as men and women of the clergy."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"It is our duty to speak the truth, not bury it. For too long the people have been fed naught but lies. It is time we took the initiative, and gave them reason to put their faith in us once more!"},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"I must agree with Theomocent."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"As I have learned firsthand, we must take care never to abuse our power and privilege, lest we hurt the people closest to us. To keep silent would be to repeat the mistakes of our past."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"The only way we can move forward is to take responsibility for our actions, and make an earnest effort to reach out to those we have wronged. While we may never receive forgiveness, at least we can attempt to atone for any anguish we may have caused those that did not deserve it."},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"If it is true that all men are born equal─as I have heard so many in this room preach time and time again─then all are entitled to know the truth. Let us lead by example, and freely share all that we have learned here today."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Father Saturnois, while I cannot pretend to understand your ordeal or soothe the fury that has taken hold in your heart, I can promise you one thing. I swear on Father Choisseau's copy of <span class=\"emphasis\">The Parables of Saint Daniffen</span> that not you, nor any of those who shared your fate will ever again be forgotten!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Thus all was laid bare before the public─the atrocities suffered by expurgator and watchman alike, along with the hand the scholasticate and the Holy See had in their terrible demise revealed to all of Ishgard by the deacon herself."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"So it was that a new path was forged that day─one that would see a renewed faith in the church and its teachings where the citizens would come to learn that all men should be regarded as equal not only in the eyes of Halone but also by one another."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"Theo is a born detective! He told me that he went to speak with the inspector because he thought it suspicious that Father Saturnois was pushing so hard to have Archombadin expelled. Sure enough, it turned out that he was the one pulling the strings all along!"},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"While I'm glad this ordeal is finally behind us, I cannot help but feel as though we lost one of our own. We share the same origins as Father Saturnois, and would have shared the same fate, had it not been for you..."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, thank you for restoring peace to the scholasticate. You have reminded us that there is a world beyond these doors that relies as much upon us as we do them."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"You have opened our eyes and shown us that destiny is but the choices we make. If we are strong and persevere, I have no doubt we can rebuild the scholasticate and regain the people's trust."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, now that your work here is done, I suppose the time for farewells is upon us. Will you be departing Ishgard immediately? It's sad to say farewell, but let's send you and the inspector off in style!"},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"Ah, there is my trusted associate. I feared I might not be able to bid you a proper farewell before I left. On behalf of my uncle, allow me to thank you for all your hard work."},{"name":"CRAMMEVOIX","text":"There's still so much fighting and bickering going on, couldn't you stay with us for just a bit longer?"},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"I fear that there are more pressing mysteries that demand my attention. Not to mention a certain young lady in Ul'dah who awaits my return."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Oho! Another client of yours, I take it?"},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"Theo, is your head screwed on backwards!? He's talking about his─"},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"Tactless fools, the both of you! But I suppose you're nothing if not sincere...eh, Theo?"},{"name":"ARCHOMBADIN","text":"And while I'll admit that naiveté is one of your more endearing traits, combined with the blunderings of the idiot beside you, it's like as not to bring the scholasticate to ruin. That's why you'll need someone with extensive knowledge of the affairs of Ishgard─and the proper connections to actually bring about the change you seek. Someone like me."},{"name":"CRAMMEVOIX","text":"The words of a man looking to steal his way into our dear Theo's heart! Hahaha! Blaisie, Leigh, it seems you've got competition."},{"name":"LEIGH","text":"The Fury take you all! Call me what you will, but Theo would never replace me with anyone─much less a conniving snake like Archombadin!"},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Hahaha! How refreshing it is to hear such playful banter among my friends! It would seem our worries are finally behind us. Before we celebrate, however, there is one last thing. Blaisie, I'd like to thank you for your support. Were it not for your meticulous notes and sharp eyes, Ulaa would still be missing."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, Inspector, words are not enough to express our gratitude. It was only because of you that we were able to unmask the perpetrator and restore peace to our school."},{"name":"THEOMOCENT","text":"Just as Father Choisseau brought you to us in Gorgagne Mills, I cannot help but feel Halone guided you to us in our time of need.
