{"quest":{"name":"A Festive Fiasco","location":"Gridania","id":69553,"patch":5.4,"sort":185,"icon":101035,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1035473,"target":1035473,"genre":204,"journal":["'Tis that season of the year again, and Amh Garanjy is making plans for an extra special Starlight.<br>※This quest is available for a limited time only.","Amh Garanjy greets you with a smile, heartened by your arrival. It would seem the ever-unflappable Starlight celebrant has been plagued by more trouble than usual in preparing for this year's festivities─such that the celebration itself is in peril if she cannot secure a capable helping hand, and quickly. Further complicating matters is the presence of Kamlito Halito, son of a prominent merchant from Ul'dah, who has been sent by his father to observe the festivities, but appears to believe himself above it all. Nonetheless, the presence of the Saint of Nymeia is evidence enough that a miracle or two may lie in your future. Should you be willing to lend your aid, you need only speak to her saturnine colleague by the waterwheel storage cabin.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","The Starlight celebrant welcomes your generous offer of assistance. Your first task, if you choose to accept it: make for the Conjurers' Guild and clean up the most indecorous decorations put up in the area by Kamlito Halito, who clearly has a less-than-stellar understanding of what the Starlight season is all about.","Thanks to your diligent work in cleaning up the unsightly decorations left by Kamlito Halito, the scene has now been set to deck the streets with décor more suitable for the season. Return to the saturnine Starlight celebrant with the unneeded baubles and report that your task is done.","Taking the improper decorations in hand, the celebrant thanks you for your efforts in his typically unenthusiastic manner, and sets off to decorate the town in more traditional Starlight fashion. He encourages you to return to Amh Garanjy, who will no doubt be overjoyed with your contributions and looking to reward you accordingly.","Amh Garanjy beams a smile upon your return, ever more confident that she has found the helper she needs to see that this year's Starlight Celebration is one to remember. Expressing her hope that Kamlito Halito, too, will come to understand the spirit of the season in time, she bids you reward yourself for your efforts with a present from the twinklebox. She further explains that her colleague Baenfaeld, as well, has received missives of gratitude from around the realm intended for you, and encourages you to peruse them from time to time. Many more preparations must be made before Starlight can commence in earnest, and your further aid would be more than appreciated."],"objectives":["Speak with the saturnine Starlight celebrant.","Clean up the misplaced ornaments.","Deliver the misplaced ornaments to the saturnine Starlight celebrant.","Report to Amh Garanjy and open the twinklebox."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"(-Expectant Child-)Is it not Starlight season yet?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"An adventurer, I take it? Why, it's as if the saint himself sent you to me! Oh, but there I go again. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Amh Garanjy, and it is my honor to serve as celebrant for the Starlight Celebration."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Well, if it isn't my favorite adventurer! I see the saint has once again guided you to me in this most wonderful of seasons. Truly, your very presence is a Starlight miracle!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"That said, I'm afraid I must apologize. There has been a bit of a rub, you see, and as such we're not quite ready to kick off the festivities as of yet."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"How shall I put it? Our troubles began when we encountered some unexpected delays in deciding on a theme for this year's event. Things spiraled from there, and as a result, we've been left with far too much to do in far too little time."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"As a result, we celebrants have been forced to recruit helpers of all stripes─from small children to strapping adventurers like yourself. Speaking of which, you wouldn't perchance be able and willing to lend us a hand, would you?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Oh, thank you, my friend! I daresay your generosity truly embodies the Starlight season. Without further ado, allow me to explain the tasks we would ask of you."},{"name":"GODBERT","text":"(-Saint of Nymeia-)Ho ho ho! It would seem you've found a most promising helper for me again this year!"},{"name":"KAMLITOHALITO","text":"(-Listless Lalafell-)Another adventurer? And I suppose this one, too, will also be wanting some kind of <span class=\"emphasis\">reward</span> for their services. I say, sometimes I wonder if this whole Starlight business is worth the effort─and the coin─we pour into it year after year."},{"name":"GODBERT","text":"(-Saint of Nymeia-)Must you be such a killjoy, my young friend? Just look at the faces of the children around you. Why, each year they spend moons waiting in eager anticipation of this most joyous of seasons, and the most delightful presents they will receive!"},{"name":"KAMLITOHALITO","text":"(-Listless Lalafell-)Ah, yes, the <span class=\"emphasis\">presents</span>. Worthless trinkets foisted off on naive young fools in hopes of making them forget the mundanity of their everyday existences. If we truly wanted to bring joy to people, would it not be more prudent to invest in things that might actually improve the quality of their daily lives?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"...Ahem. Allow me to introduce Kamlito Halito, first son of a prominent family of surveyors in Ul'dah. He's journeyed here all the way from the sultanate to help us prepare this year's festivities. Standing beside him is the Saint of Nymeia himself, a man who no doubt needs no introduction."},{"name":"KAMLITOHALITO","text":"Let me state for the record that I did not come here merely to deck the streets with gaudy lights and trinkets. I initially proposed to Father that we do away with all this mummery and transform this festival into something that would contribute more directly to the mutual economic prosperity of our nations and the realm as a whole."},{"name":"KAMLITOHALITO","text":"But did he listen? No, he simply muttered something about how he didn't raise his son to be a stuffy spoilsport, and all but demanded that I accompany Lord Mand─pardon, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Saint of Nymeia</span> here to learn something about “holiday cheer”─whatever that is supposed to mean."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Come now, Kamlito! I understand that you are serious about your family business, but I daresay it wouldn't hurt for you to lighten up from time to time. Here, perhaps this will put a smile on your face..."},{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"(-Expectant Child-)Do you mean that truly? If I help you, I can get a present, too?"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"But of course, my dear child. Behold the twinklebox!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Tucked beneath the many lids of this casket are hidden all manner of delightful wares. Why, they've been fashioned especially for this year's festivities by some of the realm's most celebrated crafters!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"For every task you complete, you will earn the opportunity to pop off one of its lids, and help yourself to the contents within."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"And that's just the start of it─needless to say, there will be even more glorious gifts in store for you when the preparations are complete and the festivities can kick off in earnest."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"You can think of this chest as something to tide you over in the meantime, and as our way of thanking you for lending us celebrants a helping hand in our time of need. What do you say, child?"},{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"(-Expectant Child-)Wow! This is wonderful! Mother and Father say I have to help out around the house during Starlight, so I don't know if I can come back."},{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"But I have plenty of time to help now! Just say what you need and leave it to Isainne to get things done!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Isainne, is it? What a generous girl you are! Thank you ever so much."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Needless to say, we've prepared some very special presents for adventurers like you as well, so I hope you can collect and enjoy them all!"},{"name":"KAMLITOHALITO","text":"Yes, yes...isn't that all so special? Now, if we're done getting all giddy about trifling baubles and toys, I should be getting back to work. &lt;sigh&gt; All those Starlight Trees aren't going to decorate themselves, after all..."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Now then, if you're ready to get started, simply head west from the amphitheatre and speak to my colleague stationed before the waterwheel hut. She'll be happy to explain all you need to know to get started."},{"name":"KAMLITOHALITO","text":"All this work, and for what─to take it all down when the festivities are over? A thorough waste of time and effort, if you ask me..."},{"name":"COMMITTEE04017","text":"An adventurer? I was expecting young Isainne, but I suppose you'll suffice. I'd like you to get to work immediately taking down the decorations nearby."},{"name":"COMMITTEE04017","text":"Hold your chocobos, now. It's not as if we're calling the celebration off. It's simply that...well, you met Kamlito Halito, yes? He was in charge of this area, and let's just say his sense for what's appropriate for Starlight leaves something to be desired."},{"name":"COMMITTEE04017","text":"I can handle things here by myself, so I'd ask you to head to the Conjurers' Guild and take down any seasonally inappropriate decorations you might find. When you're through, you can bring the inappropriate ornamentation back here to me, and I'll see that it's properly stored away."},{"name":"COMMITTEE04017","text":"Ah, yes. That should do it, then. Isainne here finished cleaning up her assigned area as well─in half the time, I might add."},{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"Did you <span class=\"emphasis\">see</span> some of those so-called decorations? It's as if that man has never attended a single day's worth of Starlight festivities in his life!"},{"name":"COMMITTEE04017","text":"At any rate, I suppose I'll see to it that the ornaments you took down are replaced with something more festive. In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if you could report to Amh in my stead."},{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"Of course! Leave it to me!"},{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"Getting presents is fun, too, but what I really enjoy is helping out and sharing the Starlight spirit!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Thank you for all your help, friend! I promise we'll get our act together one of these years. In the meantime, we truly appreciate your saintly efforts in helping us see that every child has a smile on their face for Starlight!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Allow me also to apologize on Kamlito's behalf for the extra work he created for you. The boy has much to learn, yes, but I've no doubt that he will come to understand what the spirit of the season is all about in due time."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"In the meantime, allow me to express my gratitude for all you've done in true Starlight fashion─with a present from the twinklebox. Go ahead, help yourself! And remember that there are more gifts waiting for you if you're feeling inclined to lend us your aid again."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Upon completing each of the tasks assigned to you by Amh Garanjy, you may open one of the lids of the twinklebox and help yourself to one of the presents inside."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"Oh, and lest I forget, I'm not the only one who truly appreciates your efforts─far from it! We've been receiving messages from the realm over thanking you and your fellow adventurers for all you do for the people of Eorzea each and every day."},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"My colleague Baenfaeld here in the amphitheatre is holding on to them all, so if you're curious, simply say the word─he'd be happy to share the words of appreciation and good cheer."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Missives of gratitude from across the realm have arrived in time for Starlight season. A new letter will be available to read each time preparations for the festivities are successfully completed, so be sure to take a break from your efforts from time to time and speak with Baenfaeld."}],"reward":{"items":[{"num":99,"id":32865}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}]},"next":[69554]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1035473","obj":{"i":1035473,"n":"Amh Garanjy","l":53,"q":6}},{"type":"item","id":"32865","obj":{"i":32865,"n":"Magicked Prism (Numeral 5)","l":1,"c":22632,"t":85,"p":10}},{"type":"quest","id":"69554","obj":{"i":69554,"n":"Starlight Slapdashery","g":204,"l":"Gridania","s":186}}]}
