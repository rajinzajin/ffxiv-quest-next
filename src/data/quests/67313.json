Venture to the southeast of Tailfeather to inform Q'yantaa of the good news.","You find Q'yantaa staring diligently at a rock wall for reasons unknown and unexplained to you. After you inform her of Loupard's good news, she hurries off to Tailfeather before telling you exactly what it was she was doing. Return to Tailfeather and speak with Loupard to finally meet your potential replacement.","The partner that Loupard has found looks uncomfortable in the chocobo hunter's garb, and the disappointment is clear in Q'yantaa's expression. Since he seems hesitant to introduce himself, speak with him to lighten the mood.","It seems Q'yantaa has been busy using her hunter's instincts to find the best places for chocobo hunting, but she seems skeptical of her new partner's abilities. Once again, she asks you to help her hunt. Split up and investigate the trap locations for any signs of chocobos.","Try as you might, you fail to find any trace of chocobos in or around the traps. Return to Tailfeather and inform Q'yantaa of the bad news. ","Q'yantaa seems surprisingly accepting of the fact that her instincts failed her, and instead she expresses her frustration at Gysol's tardiness. In a sudden show of compassion, her frustration turns to worry that her new partner might actually be in danger, and she resolves to go looking for him with you in tow. Accompany her to find the nervous hunter before some other beast does.","You find Gysol in a surprising situation: cooing over a chocobo hatchling which has apparently been separated from its parents. Despite Q'yantaa's protestations, Gysol resolves to take care of the chick himself, and to give up on chocobo hunting in favor of working in the stables. Return to Tailfeather and inform Loupard of this confusing hunting trip.","Loupard explains that hunters are not allowed to capture chocobo eggs or chicks, but decides to make an exception for Gysol considering that the chick would be helpless without him. With one more person in Eorzea realizing their dreams thanks to the Warrior of Light, you begin your search for Q'yantaa's partner anew."],"objectives":["Speak with Q'yantaa.","Report to Loupard.","Speak with Gysol.","Look out for chocobos at the designated locations.","Report to Q'yantaa.","Search for Gysol.","Report to Loupard."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Word of Q'yantaa's catch has been spreadin' around Tailfeather. Some say it's beginner's luck, but a few've expressed interest in joinin' with her to see a Miqo'te hunt for themselves. I've taken the liberty of findin' one I think might make a good match."},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"He's a fresh-arrived hunter that goes by the name of Gysol. I'm thinkin' we should have a li'l trial hunt to see if he and our budding prodigy get along."},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"'Course, I wouldn't be fool enough to let two greenhorns go out on a hunt unsupervised. That's why I need <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> to look after 'em. How about it, are you keen to go out huntin' with her again?"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"With any luck, she'll be off havin' adventures on her own in no time at all. Anyroad, I seen her leave the encampment just a couple of bells ago, off to the southeast. If you can find her, tell her to return to camp so we can get the introductions started."},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Q'yantaa wandered off to the southeast, gods know what for..."},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Oh, partner! What brings you all the way out here? Any chocobo sightings I should know about?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"You mean Loupard found me a <span class=\"emphasis\">real</span> partner!? I wonder what kind of bow they use? Well, best head back to Tailfeather to start my hunting career!"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"You mean to tell me <span class=\"emphasis\">that's</span> my partner? I bet he's never even <span class=\"emphasis\">ridden</span> a chocobo! "},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"Is it true? Did Q'yantaa catch a chocobo on her very first hunt? I...I'm not sure I'm qualified..."},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Now that everyone's here, how 'bout we all play nice an' introduce ourselves? Gysol's a shy bloke─why don't you try strikin' up the conversation?"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"He might look nervous, but he'll warm up to you in no time!"},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"Well met... I'm Gysol...like the gysahl green."},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"I came to Tailfeather in hopes of making my fortune, but... I didn't expect dragons and bandersnatches..."},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"...But I don't plan on going home empty-handed! With Q'yantaa as my partner, we'll catch a chocobo that'll have those snobby Ishgardians groveling at our feet...right?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Just when I thought I'd found a partner... Say, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, how about lending us a hand just one more time? I think <span class=\"emphasis\">someone</span> might need it."},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"That's what I wanted to hear! There might be hope for us after all! While some <span class=\"emphasis\">other</span> hunters were cowering in their smallclothes, I've scouted a few places that're just chock-full of chocobos."},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"I set up a few traps to the northwest of here. Scout out your respective areas and we'll meet back here to share our findings. Remember, a slow hunter is a poor hunter!"},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Best of luck with these two!"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"You're back! So, how many chocobos did we catch?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"My story's the same... Well, I guess a hunt can't succeed <span class=\"emphasis\">every</span> time. Anyroad, where in the seven hells is Gysol? I reckon he saw some dragons and ran off..."},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Well, it's not as if we can wait here till the next Astral Era. Besides, he didn't look the type who could defend himself, and the last thing I need is some rookie hunter's blood on my hands... Let's go look for him, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, before a bandersnatch gobbles him up."},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"He <span class=\"emphasis\">should</span> be just to the east of the encampment... Godsdammit, how hard is it to find a reliable hunter in a <span class=\"emphasis\">hunter's</span> camp!?"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"What in the seven hells is he doing!? The chocobos are over <span class=\"emphasis\">there</span>!"},{"name":"BABYCHOCOBO01777","text":"Kweh! Kweh!"},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"Q'yantaa, look at this! It's a chocobo hatchling... I wonder where its mother is?

Leave it here!"},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"But this one was separated from its mother. It's bound to starve or get eaten if we just leave it here..."},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"That's why I have to care for it until it grows as hale as Ishgard's mightiest steeds! Aye, I think...I think hunting might not be in my nature."},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"My mind is made up─I'll work in the stables while I raise this hatchling. And I have your hunting instincts to thank for helping me see my path, Q'yantaa!"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Well, I've never been one to tell another how to live... I hope you're better at raising chocobos than you are at hunting them!"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Well, I guess it's time to get back to Tailfeather. Gysol, I'll go with you to make sure you don't fall prey to any beasts along the way!"},{"name":"QYANTAA","text":"Looks like the search for a partner continues..."},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"I've told Loupard of my decision to work in the stables.

It's too bad huntin' ain't his callin', but everyone here is free to make their own choices."},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"Now about the hatchlin' he brought along... Generally, we don't allow hunters to take eggs or chicks, since if we did, pretty soon the forest'd be nothin' but bandersnatches and dragons."},{"name":"LOUPARD","text":"But it looks like this one's lost its mother, and Gysol seems right adamant about raisin' it himself, so...I think I can make an exception this time."},{"name":"GYSOL","text":"Thank you, Loupard!
