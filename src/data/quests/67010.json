Even as Cid and G'raha Tia rack their brains to find a solution, two peculiar individuals arrive and offer their aid. They introduce themselves as Doga and Unei, scholars of ancient Allag sent by the Students of Baldesion. Though Rammbroes is at first suspicious of their origin, he relents at G'raha Tia's behest, and allows them to join NOAH in an advisory capacity. Without further ado, Doga and Unei are asked to examine the sealed gate which leads into Syrcus Tower. Accompany the two scholars to the Eight Sentinels, and there speak with Biggs to be shown to the gate.","Much to the surprise of all present, Doga and Unei open the gate as if they were born to do it. Speak with Doga to learn how this feat was possible.","Doga and Unei reveal that they are “clones”─copies of two individuals who claim direct descent from Emperor Xande, the founding father of the Allagan Empire. In his desire to bring the world under his rule, Xande consorted with forbidden powers. Fearful of what might befall the world, the original Doga and Unei attempted to thwart their emperor's scheme. They imbued their clones with their will, that their work might continue in the event of their deaths. After millennia in slumber, the two clones now seek to finish what their namesakes had begun, but they require your help to succeed. The members of NOAH unanimously agree to join their cause, and Rammbroes tasks you with eliminating all hostile elements within Syrcus Tower and finally defeating Emperor Xande. See to your preparations, then speak with G'raha Tia.","You have declared your readiness to enter Syrcus Tower to G'raha Tia. Fight your way to the top of the structure, and strike down Emperor Xande.<br><br>※Syrcus Tower can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","You have defeated Xande, but your victory proves short-lived. Even as Doga and Unei attempt to annul the emperor's dark covenant, an entity calling itself the Cloud of Darkness pulls them into the rift that had manifested before the throne. Nero attempts to save them for his own reasons, only to end up sharing their fate.","With the rift having vanished, you are powerless to help your friends. For now, return to Saint Coinach's Find, and consult Rammbroes as to a way to bring them back.","Rammbroes believes that Doga, Unei, and Nero were drawn through a voidgate, and into the dark realm beyond. Though they do not yet know how, the members of NOAH are determined to save their comrades and eliminate the threat posed by the Cloud of Darkness. Rammbroes pledges to search for the answer, and bids you rest up in preparation for the instrumental role you will doubtless play in the impending rescue mission."],"objectives":["Speak with Biggs at the Eight Sentinels to be taken to Syrcus Tower.","Speak with Doga at the Eight Sentinels.","Speak with G'raha Tia at the Eight Sentinels.","Enter Syrcus Tower.","Speak with Rammbroes."],"dialogue":[{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"Ah, 'tis you, my friend.

I'm ashamed to say that there is nothing worthwhile to report."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"The Sons continue to probe the Labyrinth of the Ancients, and every day brings new discoveries.

There was...a pain, but it has subsided."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Well, well, this is rather unexpected. Your right eye is the same as ours."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"The same? You...you have the Allagan Eye as well?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"This sanguine hue is said to be a trait unique to the Allagans!

He will brief you on the situation."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I shall join you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

'Tis our hope that we can be of some small assistance."},{"name":"CID","text":"If your attire is aught to go by, your assistance should prove invaluable indeed."},{"name":"CID","text":"To begin with, let me tell you where we stand. Beyond rises Syrcus Tower, the principal spire of the structure collectively known as the Crystal Tower."},{"name":"CID","text":"The only way to get inside is through the proverbial front door─the imposing gate you see here. The problem is, we can't get it to open. It's sealed by some mechanism whose workings are an utter mystery to us."},{"name":"CID","text":"Having had no success via more <span class=\"emphasis\">orthodox</span> methods, I went at it with everything from a pickaxe to a magitek cannon. Nothing so much as put a scratch on it."},{"name":"CID","text":"For a blessing, the gate doesn't try to reduce us to ashes like the Eight Sentinels, but that doesn't make it any less effective a security measure. It's fiendishly frustrating in its simplicity."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"The only clue we have is the elaborate device carved upon it: a man and a woman, respectant. Allagan royalty, by my judgment."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Precisely who these individuals were, we cannot say. Nor do we know whether the device actually serves a purpose. Like as not, it is purely decorative."},{"name":"CID","text":"If you're thinking to force it, save your strength. It's no use─just ask the calluses on my hands."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Rest assured we do not mean to waste our strength."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Indeed. Why should we exert ourselves...when the gate will open of its own accord?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I...I don't think any of us expected <span class=\"emphasis\">that</span> to happen..."},{"name":"CID","text":"Seven hells...

You're still alive!?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"Garlond, Garlond. If I didn't know better, I would say you weren't happy to see me. Ah, but I jest. In light of our recent meetings, you have every right to be wary."},{"name":"NERO","text":"But rest assured I am no longer a threat to you. My legion is for all intents and purposes defunct, and my association with it means a tight noose awaits me back in Garlemald. And so I've been roaming this land Eorzea, a regular itinerant."},{"name":"NERO","text":"In the course of my wanderings, I chanced to catch wind of your latest venture. It sounded positively fascinating, and so I decided to come here and join you."},{"name":"CID","text":"After the wrongs you've committed? You think us that gullible?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"If you are suspicious of my intent, 'tis only my just deserts. But I am determined to make amends. As a gesture of goodwill, I will share with you what I know...starting with <span class=\"emphasis\">these</span> two odd characters."},{"name":"NERO","text":"As you are doubtless already aware, the Crystal Tower was the symbol of ancient Allag's might and prosperity. Entry was permitted only to royalty and a select few individuals."},{"name":"NERO","text":"According to the records I have unearthed, only royal blood can open the gate. In other words, the emperor and his progeny were living keys."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"You mean to say that these two are descended from Allagan royalty!?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"Oh, I suggest nothing so glamorous."},{"name":"NERO","text":"To put it plain, they are <span class=\"emphasis\">imitations</span> of royalty─living keys born of Allagan ingenuity."},{"name":"NERO","text":"“Clones,” I believe, is the name your creators gave your kind. Is that not so?"},{"name":"DOGA","text":"'Twould seem that the time for concealment is past."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Pray accept our apologies. 'Twas not our intent to deceive. We simply wished to avoid causing undue alarm by prematurely making what many would consider deranged claims."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"If it please you, let us return to the Eight Sentinels. There is much and more to tell."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Very well."},{"name":"CID","text":"Seven hells, do you <span class=\"emphasis\">seriously</span> mean to follow us around?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"Come, Garlond. You know me better than to think that I spoke in jest. What more will it take for us to be reconciled? A gift, perhaps?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"An Allagan tomestone. It holds the information I just shared with you, and a deal more besides. It used to be the jealously guarded property of the XIVth Legion, but it's yours now. I wish you joy of it."},{"name":"NERO","text":"I look forward to working together, old friend."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"You have every right to mistrust us, but I beg you to hear us out. Long have we waited for this opportunity to fulfill our life's purpose."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Let us hear what Unei and Doga have to say. It will not be too late to decide upon a course of action afterwards."},{"name":"CID","text":"It goes without saying that Nero can't be trusted. We'd do well to keep an eye on him at all times."},{"name":"NERO","text":"We may not have gotten off to the best of starts, but the past is in the past. Yesterday's enemies can yet be today's friends. Do you not agree, Warrior of Light?"},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"The chief and Nero go all the way back to the Magitek Academy. It's an exclusive school situated in the capital, reserved for the Empire's brightest elite."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"I don't know the nitty-gritty details, but they didn't get along back then, and they don't get along now. Fate's a bastard for bringing them together again."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"To think the Allagans could make copies of <span class=\"emphasis\">people</span>... If this knowledge were to fall into the wrong hands, the world would become a terrible place. I shudder to imagine a dozen Biggs, shouting at me all day long... &lt;gulp&gt;"},{"name":"DOGA","text":"If you are ready to listen, we shall tell you all."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"As it pertains closely to your investigation, your leader, Rammbroes, may wish to be present."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Before we begin, pray allow me to apologize again. It was not our intent to deceive you."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"As you will have already gathered, we are not scholars sent by the Students of Baldesion. Nay, we are “clones”─copies of people who once existed, given life through Allagan technology."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"This is rather a lot to take in..."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"If it would not be considered unseemly, might I ask why you and yours were created? And more specifically, what is it that you now seek to do?"},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Answering your questions requires that we revisit Allagan history. Pray bear with us."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"The Allagan Empire reached its zenith long before our kind came into being."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"In that glorious age, the Crystal Tower stood tall as the symbol of Allagan pride. Parents took their children there, that they might learn how the nigh-limitless energy it produced brought prosperity to the whole empire."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"That prosperity, however, bred decadence, and the empire began to show signs of stagnation. This decline was made all the more rapid for want of strong leadership."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"In a matter of generations, the Allagan civilization became a pale shadow of its former self. Its once gleaming cities fell into disrepair, and its frontier lands were given over to the wilderness."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Lamenting the pitiful state of affairs, one technologist made it his mission to restore Allag to greatness."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Amon was his name, and he believed that the ailing empire wanted for but a potent ruler. And none was more potent than its founding father, whom he sought to resurrect."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"The founding father? You cannot mean Emperor Xande!?"},{"name":"UNEI","text":"None other. As part of his experiments, Amon created clones of the emperor's descendants. We are the products of that experiment─copies of Unei and Doga."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"Historical texts mention the reigns of two Allagan emperors named Xande."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"It was commonly believed that the second was the namesake of the first. After all, such a custom is not uncommon among royalty and commoners alike. To think that the two were in fact one and the same..."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Aye, Xande returned from the grave and assumed his throne once more. And true to Amon's prediction, the emperor restored his realm to the glory it once knew. Would that he could have been satisfied with that..."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"In his previous life, the emperor desired to bring the entire world under Allagan dominion─an ambition that ultimately went unfulfilled. Having been granted a second chance, he was determined to succeed."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Realizing that he needed more power to wage his war of conquest, Xande turned his sights towards a forbidden source: darkness. In order to learn how to harness this power, he converted the Crystal Tower into a restricted research facility."},{"name":"CID","text":"Darkness...<span class=\"emphasis\">again</span>? Seven hells, what is it with megalomaniacal rulers turning to darkness in their lust for power?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Well, at least this one won't be bothering us, being thousands of years dead and all."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Would that you were right, Master Garlond."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Alas, Emperor Xande is very much alive. Within Syrcus Tower he still abides, his ambition burning all the more ardently for his empire's collapse."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Wielding the power of darkness requires prodigious amounts of energy─energy that not even the Crystal Tower could produce. In order to augment the shortfall, Dalamud was created and launched into the heavens. On high it hung, gathering the sun's energy and channeling it to the tower below."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"However, a miscalculation resulted in a surge of energy that escaped into the land. This triggered an earthquake of unprecedented violence─the calamity that ushered in the Fourth Umbral Era."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"In the blinking of an eye, the mighty Allagan Empire was laid to waste."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Yet even as the Crystal Tower was sinking into the earth, the technologist Amon, now Emperor Xande's closest aide, invoked powerful magicks and halted the flow of time."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Every soul within the structure, the emperor included, was placed in a deep slumber. In that state they were to remain until the time was ripe to awaken."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Eras came and went. After millennia lying dormant, Dalamud was summoned back to the earth. Its descent triggered the Seventh Umbral Calamity, in the wake of which the Crystal Tower reemerged."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"At that moment, Emperor Xande awakened."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"In his lust for power, the emperor consorted with darkness and was seduced by its corrupting influence. Even though his empire is now little more than a fading memory, he will stop at nothing to see his ambition realized."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"'Tis for no other purpose but to put an end to Xande's madness that we exist. This is the mantle we have inherited from our namesakes─the true Unei and Doga."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Fearing what might befall the world, the two of them sought to thwart their emperor. They gave unto us their will, that we might carry on their mission should they fail."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"When we came to our senses within the Crystal Tower, we deliberated a course of action. Concluding that we alone could not overcome Xande, we struck out to find a worthy ally. It has taken years, but our search is finally over."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"'Tis no ordinary <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> who can cut a path through the Labyrinth of the Ancients. With you as our champion, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span>, we are confident that we can end Xande's dark ambition once and for all."},{"name":"CID","text":"Well, that'll teach me for speaking too soon... Setting my chagrin aside, I see now why you knew about the Students of Baldesion among a host of other things─you were observing our investigation the whole time."},{"name":"CID","text":"So, what will we do, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? The world's in grave danger again, and it just so happens you're an expert at saving it."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"You have our eternal gratitude. Together, let us see the Allagan Empire's dark past laid to rest."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"It has been our mission to recover the long-lost knowledge of the Allagan civilization. But what worth is that knowledge if it means subjecting the realm to peril?"},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"Truth be told, it pains me to think that the tower's secrets may become lost to us, but the greater good must ever come first. Besides, no quantity of ancient relics can compare to our friends Unei and Doga─living, breathing Allagans."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"And so I hereby declare a change in NOAH's objective. Henceforth, we shall direct all efforts towards sealing off Syrcus Tower. Its dark secrets must never know the light of day."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, as you did for us within the Labyrinth of the Ancients, I would have you enter the structure and eliminate hostile elements. Suffice it to say this includes Emperor Xande himself."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"Meanwhile, the rest of us shall examine ways to isolate Syrcus Tower from the outside world. To work, then!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Wait. There is something I must know. My right eye is like yours. Does...does this mean...?"},{"name":"DOGA","text":"You inherited the trait from your father, you said. Know that clones are unable to bear offspring. You have no cause for concern."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"The Allagan Eye, you called it, but to us it is the Royal Eye, owing to the fact that the trait manifests only in those possessed of royal blood."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"I cannot well explain why the eye runs in your line, but I am disinclined to think it a coincidence."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Though you are doubtless impatient to learn the truth, pray have patience. All will be revealed in due time."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Though their names do not appear to have survived the passage of time, Doga and Unei were worthy individuals. They were not without faults, but they placed the welfare of the people above all else."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"When Xande was resurrected, they supported his second ascension to the throne, in hopes that the empire would flourish once more under his leadership."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"When it came to light that Xande was consorting with dark powers, they did all within their power to stop him. Among their many acts, they imbued us, two humble clones, with their will."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Within Syrcus Tower, you will encounter clones who share our appearance."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Though they, too, were created in the image of Doga and Unei, they are but empty husks bereft of independent will. Their sole purpose is to eliminate intruders."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Striking down spitting images of Unei and myself may give you pause, but you must not let that stay your hand."},{"name":"CID","text":"Technology made the Allagans great, but so too did it prove their downfall. And now the Garleans are treading in their very footsteps, the bloody fools. It's true what they say: history repeats itself."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"...Nero? Wandered off on his own a moment ago. Only the gods know what that bastard's scheming. If it were up to me, I'd lock him up and throw the key into Silvertear Lake."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"While you're off purging Syrcus Tower of nasties, Biggs and I will make a round of the Labyrinth─make certain that no funny business is going on inside."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"My apologies if I've given you cause to worry. I am quite well, I assure you. As you can appreciate, there has been much for me to think on."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"But now is the time for action, not idle thoughts. Syrcus Tower awaits us!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Your task is to eliminate all hostile elements within the structure, Xande himself included. This will afford us the chance to seal off the facility. May the Crystal grant you strength!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"The truth of my eye is ever on my mind, but right now every man of us has a job to do. Rest assured I shan't allow myself to be distracted."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"You did it! You defeated Emperor Xande!"},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Empires may rise and fall, but man's indefatigable spirit ever lives on. Truly, you are the champion we had hoped for, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span>."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"With Emperor Xande now at eternal rest, his dark legacy may be undone."},{"name":"CID","text":"What are you playing at now, Nero?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"In case you haven't noticed, Garlond, these are dangerous surrounds. Can a man be faulted for exercising due caution?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"At any rate, you needn't mind me. I am perfectly capable of looking after myself. Go on and finish what you came to do."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"There are two ways that we may seal off Syrcus Tower: either isolate it from the outside world, or cripple its ability to produce energy."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"The choice of method is yours to make. Before you proceed, however, Doga and I must needs attend to a task."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"That distortion... What is it?"},{"name":"UNEI","text":"The power that Xande sought to obtain comes from the void─the World of Darkness, our people called it."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"And the true nature of that power was none other than the armies of voidsent."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"Voidsent feed on aether, as you may already know, and no plane is richer in it than ours."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"In exchange for their allegiance, Xande entered into an unholy covenant. He would open a gate through which the voidsent could freely enter our world."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"The covenant, I'm afraid to say, is still in effect. However, being of the emperor's lineage, Unei and I believe that we can annul it."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"By his blood Xande sealed his dark pact. By our blood it shall be undone."},{"name":"DOGA","text":"It is time."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Yes, Doga. Finally, we may fulfill our purpose."},{"name":"NERO","text":"Hahahahaha... AHAHAHAHAHA!"},{"name":"NERO","text":"Oh, be still my beating heart!"},{"name":"NERO","text":"For a moment I feared that this outing would end in disappointment, but my readings were not mistaken! Not even the Ultima Weapon compares to this!"},{"name":"CID","text":"What are you going on about!?"},{"name":"CLOUDOFDARKNESS","text":"(-???-)The covenant...is everlasting..."},{"name":"XANDE","text":"And so Meracydia is brought into the fold. Soon, all the world shall be united under Allagan rule."},{"name":"XANDE","text":"And yet...with every dream that becomes reality, the memory of death grows ever more vivid─an endless void, bereft of light and warmth."},{"name":"XANDE","text":"Though I may have defeated death, it did not leave me unscathed. Nay, its ravening claws have scarred my soul for eternity. Never shall I know peace."},{"name":"XANDE","text":"Beings without will. You cannot fathom my rage. My melancholy. My <span class=\"emphasis\">fear</span>."},{"name":"XANDE","text":"What worth is wealth and power when all must inevitably be consigned to nothingness? If man has nothing, he need not know the pain of loss."},{"name":"XANDE","text":"So let there <span class=\"emphasis\">be</span> nothing."},{"name":"XANDE","text":"Harvest more power, that the gate may be thrown full open. Let the Cloud of Darkness come and engulf the world, devouring all life, hopes, and dreams. Let all be returned to nothingness."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Pull yourself together!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Is there no end to them!? What in the seven hells is happening!?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Argh! Not now, damn it!"},{"name":"CID","text":"Nero! Were they part of your grand plan, too?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"Save your japes, Garlond! I didn't put up with your arrogant face to play with worthless clones!"},{"name":"NERO","text":"Something controls them. A voidsent, and no ordinary one at that."},{"name":"UNEI","text":"Doga!"},{"name":"NERO","text":"Confound it!

What are we supposed to do now?"},{"name":"CID","text":"As much as it pains me to leave without them, there's precious little we can do. Let us return to the Find and consult Rammbroes."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I feel as though that I'm forgetting something important, but for the life of me, I cannot remember what that something is..."},{"name":"CID","text":"Rammbroes may know a way to bring our friends back.

I shudder to imagine what this voidsent is capable of."},{"name":"CID","text":"However dreadful it may be, we can't abandon our friends. Is there no way to save them?"},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"I will not lie to you, Master Garlond. The situation is bleak."},{"name":"RAMMBROES","text":"Though voidsent can enter our world, instances of men entering the void have never been documented.
