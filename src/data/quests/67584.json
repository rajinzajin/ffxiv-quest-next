Apparently, Mujih is planning a series of articles, for which she seeks the guild's permission to follow the doings of a first-rate botanist. With none of your peers available who fit the bill, Fufucha recommends you as the subject for Mujih's story. At the same time, she bids you answer a call for aid from faraway Ishgard, which comes through your friend and colleague Roiteloin. Take the letter of introduction Fufucha has given you, and deliver it to Roiteloin at Skyfire Locks.","Roiteloin assures you that a letter of introduction is unnecessary to vouch for your ability, and goes on to share with you the particulars of the call for aid. The petitioner is a botanist named Basyle, who is stationed at Camp Cloudtop in the Sea of Clouds. Roiteloin will arrange for you to meet him at the aetheryte plaza in Foundation; make your way there and join Mujih Mewrilah ahead of time.","You speak with Basyle, who informs you of his work at Camp Cloudtop. He labors to alleviate the outpost's reliance on supplies being shipped in, but his attempts to raise crops thus far have met with little success. It is his hope that your abundant knowledge and skilled hands will serve to aid his cause.

Have you given any thought to my request?"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"(-Animated Maiden-)Oh, I beg your pardon! I didn't know you had a guest! Judging by your attire, I take it you're a botanist as well?"},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"I am sorry, but our situation is unchanged. I am afraid there are no botanists at present who can assist with your story."},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"(-Animated Maiden-)I won't make a burden of myself, I promise! I just need them to answer a few questions in their spare time.

She is planning a series of articles, for which she requests our guild's cooperation."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Specifically, she would like to follow the doings of a first-rate botanist for an indefinite period of time. Alas, none among us who meets her stringent requirements can afford to engage her at present─none save for perhaps you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>..."},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Ooh!

Well, a friend of his is struggling to raise crops in the Ishgardian frontier, and he begs us send a botanist to aid him."},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"The Ishgardian frontier? That sounds positively <span class=\"emphasis\">wild</span>! I can already picture the title: “Foreign Botanist at the <span class=\"emphasis\">Fore</span>frontier”!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Heh, I've got a good feeling about this! I'll go on ahead to Roiteloin's place, and ask him a few questions!"},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"...She certainly wastes no time.

Aye, Mistress Mujih has told me everything, and rather more besides."},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"A letter of introduction? Ever proper is our Fufucha. She scarcely needs one of these to vouch for your skill, my friend."},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"As you will have been informed, the petition comes not from me, but a friend. Basyle is his name, and he is a botanist engaged in settling the Sea of Clouds. That is where your task will take you, and for an extended period of time."},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"Some years ago, House Haillenarte established an outpost there, and they seek to make the place self-sufficient. To this end, my friend has been attempting to cultivate various crops. Alas, results have been mixed at best. And that is where you come into the picture."},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"Now, I should like to send you along to Basyle at once, except Ishgard isn't accommodating of foreigners. We must find a way to circumvent the bureaucracy."},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"Hm, you have some skill at arms, have you not? Then you should be able to enter our nation in the capacity of a mercenary. However, I have doubts whether Mistress Mujih will be permitted to accompany you..."},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"You are a guest of House Fortemps, you say? Well then, your entry was not an issue from the first. However, I have doubts whether Mistress Mujih will be permitted to accompany you..."},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"You needn't worry! I have ways of getting into places, and I <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> get into Ishgard. See if I don't!"},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"That is well...I think."},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"Now then, Basyle has returned to the Holy See to meet with you. If it suits, I shall let him know to look for you at the aetheryte plaza."},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"At the aetheryte plaza─got it! I'll see you there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"ROITELOIN","text":"Basyle has returned to the Holy See to meet with you. I shall let him know to look for you at the aetheryte plaza."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Ah, you must be the botanist Roiteloin sent. I must say, your retainer is quite a character."},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"What took you so long? Your client's been waiting for the better part of a bell!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Curious how I got into Ishgard, I shouldn't doubt? For now, let it suffice to say: if anyone asks, I'm your retainer!"},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"'Tis a pleasure to meet you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, and your lively retainer as well. I'm Basyle. Thank you for making the long journey to Ishgard. Though we still have some ways to go, to be sure."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"As I'm sure you've been told, I'm a botanist at Camp Cloudtop. We're heavily reliant on supplies being brought in by airship, but I'm trying to change that.

I'll be turning to your abundant knowledge and skilled hands both."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"In case you're wondering, I haven't any work for you just yet─today's a meet and greet, as it were.

I shall convey all your messages without delay!"},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"I'd be much obliged, miss. Now then, I'd best be getting back to my work. I look forward to seeing you again, most certainly at Camp Cloudtop."},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"I'll remain here in Ishgard and await word from Basyle.
