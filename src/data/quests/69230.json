Wait, you <span class=\"emphasis\">were</span> a dreaming child once, yes? That's how it works, is it not?"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Anyhow, let me guess: you loved to dream of going on grand adventures. Journeying to the bottom of the deepest waters! Braving perilous ruins in search of ancient treasures! Why, that's what <span class=\"emphasis\">I'd</span> like to dream of if I were a mortal child!"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Yes, I do believe that settles it: something precious from the ruins of the House of the First Light should be just what I need to spin the most stirring and dramatic dream ever! And <span class=\"emphasis\">you're</span> going to bring it to me─for the children, of course!"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"What sort of relic will make the children happy? Well, how should I know? Only one of us has been a mortal child once, and it certainly isn't me! Anyhow, I'll leave it up to you. If I don't like what you bring me, I'll just send you back for more! Tee hee!"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Ooh! You're back! Wait...back from where, again? Oh, that's right! Tell me: what wondrous relic did you find for me under the waters?"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Why, it's a teensy-weensy figure of a knight. How very interesting!"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"They say that in the old days of Voeburt, people used to play a game where they moved these bitsy people around a board. It doesn't sound nearly as fun as spinning dreams, but to each their own, I suppose."},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"A silver ring...? It's so strangely cold to the touch. And these engravings..."},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Ack! These runes are to ward away pixies! Whatever is the meaning of this, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!? Could it be that─gasp!─you don't like me as much as I like you?"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Why, it's an old Voeburtite coin! They say that back in the days of the Kingdom, you could buy all sorts of things with these. I haven't seen one of these in years..."},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Anyhow, I simply must polish it up to the finest sheen! Only the very best for my dreamers!"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"In any event, I do believe this will make for a most rousing treasure hunt for the children. If only you could be a child again, yes? I'd like nothing more than to spin you a dream as a token of my thanks!"}],"reward":{"gil":606,"reputation":60,"items":[{"num":15,"id":28},{"id":28186}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":3,"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1031809","obj":{"i":1031809,"n":"Uin Nee","l":2956,"q":28}},{"type":"item","id":"28","obj":{"i":28,"n":"Allagan Tomestone of Poetics","l":1,"c":65023,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"28186","obj":{"i":28186,"n":"Fae Fancy","l":1,"c":65074,"t":100}}]}
