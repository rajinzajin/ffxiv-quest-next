Before risking direct confrontation with Titan, Y'shtola proposes that you learn more about your foe by speaking to former members of the Company of Heroes─the famous band of mercenaries who defeated the dread primal once before. She directs you to the Grey Fleet mills in lower La Noscea, where one such individual is said to reside.","Your search leads you to Trachtoum, the self-proclaimed “best axeman” of the Company of Heroes.

Yet the situation is far from simple. The kobolds are not prone to unprovoked aggression. Did not the thalassocracy make a pact with the beastmen that each would keep to their own lands, and that no blood would be shed?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"...And was it not the <span class=\"emphasis\">Lominsans</span> who violated this agreement, dissatisfied with their lot?
