Now it's time I fulfilled my half of the bargain, and explained what has befallen your comrades."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"That is a conversation I would rather have in the privacy of my quarters, however. I must go on ahead to the tower and organize a few things, but I shall see that the guard knows to admit you."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"The tower's gate lies open, then?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Just like that?
