Upon closer inspection, you realize that the ash spells out a message."},{"name":"SECRETLETTER","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">To the kind soul who finds this missive,<br>Pray deliver this letter to the unassuming Miqo'te scholar who can usually be found sequestered in a quiet corner of the Confluence.<br>Many thanks.</span>"},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"Yes? Were you looking for me? I suspect I spend too much time in this corner of the Confluence if someone I've never met knows to find me here."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"A letter? If you don't mind me asking, can you tell me where you found this?"},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"Of course... I see..."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"The place where you chanced upon this is one of dubious prominence. Students are confined there as punishment for...recalcitrant behavior. I believe I recognize the hand which penned this message."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"The student is an acquaintance of mine, although that might be a rather generous term. Several days ago he was confined there for concocting an explosive alchemical compound and using it to “surprise” his teachers. His little stunt ended with half the gardens in the Teachers' Quarters in ashes."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"And it seems he put more effort into writing a message to his would-be courier than to his letter's recipient...<br><span class=\"emphasis\">Bring me food and a candle.</span><br>I see..."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"That boorish lout! It serves him right, being locked up in that room!"},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; As you can doubtless surmise, our relationship is somewhat strained, and I apologize for making you party to it. But what's done is done, and now I would ask a favor of you myself."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"Could you procure a candle from Toffwyb at the Agora? I shall prepare the food this fool has requested, much as I would rather not. When you are done, pray meet me at the spot where you found the letter."},{"name":"TOFFWYB","text":"A candle, you say? Why of course─here, take this. Please inform the requesting student that they can pay at their leisure."},{"name":"TOFFWYB","text":"The student can pay at their leisure. I know they're good for it."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"There you are. Were you able to acquire the candle?"},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"Yes, this shall do. Once again I must apologize for sending you to and fro, but the sooner this matter is concluded, the better off we both shall be."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"I suppose since you are from a foreign land, you are unaware of what this candle represents. There is a reason that scoundrel requested a candle of this type."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"Long ago, one of the students confined within these rooms spent his days unraveling some of the most troublesome mathematical problems of the time. With nothing to distract his attention, he was quite successful."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"He wrote the equations on his wall with the blackened ends of his spent candles. When the professors saw what he had done, well, they were too impressed to be angry."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"Doubtless that idiot means to make his own mark, as many delinquent students have attempted to since. The professors will turn a blind eye to his vandalism, to be sure─they would not let rules impede discovery."},{"name":"CORNERSTUDENT","text":"Anyroad, I will deliver these to him. Perhaps some good can come of his selfish request. Here, take this for your troubles. I pray there are no more."}],"reward":{"gil":815},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69916]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1039345","obj":{"i":1039345,"n":"Bookish Miqo'te","l":3706,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69916","obj":{"i":69916,"n":"Sound the Bell, School's In","g":11,"l":"Old Sharlayan","s":534}}]}
