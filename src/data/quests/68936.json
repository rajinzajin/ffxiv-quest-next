Urianger doesn't pay any attention to us anymore!"},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Of late, Urianger has been paying us no mind. He always used to have time for us, but now he is busy with other things. He leaves us with no choice but to play tricks on him."},{"name":"PIXIEB03400","text":"That's right! We're going to play tricks on Urianger, and you're going to help us prepare them!"},{"name":"PIXIEB03400","text":"First of all, we'll need to draw water from Handmirror Lake. Come and meet me by the water!"},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"My spirited friend awaits you by the lake. Off you go, now."},{"name":"PIXIEB03400","text":"For our trick, we need nice, clean water, and I want you to carry it. But normal carrying is insufferably boring."},{"name":"PIXIEB03400","text":"That's why I've asked the faeries who dwell in these parts to make an exciting game out of it!"},{"name":"PIXIEB03400","text":"Try to carry the water back to the Bookman's Shelves without dying, you hear? And don't be too slow either. Slow is boring!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Deliver the heavy barrel to the dispirited pixie at the Bookman's Shelves."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You will have ninety seconds to complete the task. Should you fail, return to the starting location and begin anew."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Be wary of attacks from enemies, which will sap your strength."},{"name":"PIXIEB03400","text":"Spilled the water, did you? Oh well, you'll just have to start over!"},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Oh? I was under the impression you were to bring me water. Better head back to the lake...and best of luck making it back."},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Well, well, you actually came back alive. Most don't, so give yourself a pat on the back."},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Hm? How will we use this water, you ask? We'll boil it and then pour it into a pot with some withered leaves. This produces a foul, brown water that Urianger absolutely loathes."},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Now, while I prepare the water, I want you to go and fetch a fragrant treat from the cabinet over in the corner. That's another thing that Urianger loathes."},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"The fragrant treat should be in the cabinet yonder. Go and fetch it while I prepare the water."},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Did you find the treat?"},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Good, good. Now everything is in readiness. Heh heh, I can't wait to see the look on Urianger's face when we offer this to him."},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"...But hmmm, my friend sure is taking their time. Let's go and find them."},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Here they are. They were just smelling the flowers on the way."},{"name":"PIXIEB03400","text":"The preparations are in order? Excellent! All that remains is to await Urianger's return!"},{"name":"PIXIEA03400","text":"Tee hee, we never tire of seeing him gag as he sips the brown water! But he's so polite, he always drinks it to the last drop. Why, I almost feel sorry for him! Anyway, our thanks for helping us. Let's do it again sometime!"}],"reward":{"gil":898},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}],"quests":[68846]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1029882","obj":{"i":1029882,"n":"Dispirited Pixie","l":2956,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1030416","obj":{"i":1030416,"n":"Spirited Pixie","l":2956,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68846","obj":{"i":68846,"n":"Unto the Truth","g":8,"l":"Il Mheg","s":320}}]}
