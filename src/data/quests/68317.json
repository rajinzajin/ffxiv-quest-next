I have always been curious to observe a warrior from outside the Steppe in battle. You see, as a hunter, it is my duty to defend the Dawn Throne and the surrounding perimeterâ”€especially against creatures known as chaochus."},{"name":"ORONIRHUNTER02781","text":"As such, I am constantly searching for ways to improve my own fighting technique. I feel there is a lot I can learn by observing you. Please, if you are willing, meet me to the southwest of here. There you can demonstrate to me your combat style."},{"name":"ORONIRHUNTER02781","text":"This area is populated by chaochus. Please go and slay two.

Though, should they be missing even a single petal, it would ruin the gesture entirely."},{"name":"ORONIRHUNTER02781","text":"While I have little difficulty in taking down these monsters, I often end up destroying their flowers in the process. I am confident that in incorporating a few of your techniques this can change."},{"name":"ORONIRHUNTER02781","text":"I shall not forget the knowledge you have bestowed upon me today.
