However, before he questions you further, he asks that you accompany him outside the Cups. It seems there is something he wishes to show you...<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Outside the Cups, Naroshs Koal presents to you a collection of rubbish likely dropped into the ocean from a ship as it sailed overhead. Unlike other Ondo, he has an insatiable curiosity for knowledge of finless ones and their ways, and so he bids you inspect the debris and tell him what purpose it once served.","Your explanations have given the Ondo youth much to mull over. Indeed, he is like to remain lost in thought if you do not speak to him again.","Naroshs Koal is grateful for your words of wisdom, but is nevertheless disappointed. Before you can press him further, however, an older Ondo, Xeroshs Ooan, arrives and scolds the youth for wandering off with you in tow. He then turns to you and explains that their clutchmother, who is pregnant, may not be able to give birth safely in the absence of water, and so they wish to entreat your assistance. You are to return to the Cups and speak with her directly.","Xeroshs Ooan introduces you to the Ondo clutchmother, who speaks to you from the privacy of her chambers. Though the Ondo bear you no ill will for drawing back the waters of their realm, they hope that you will grant them the boon of knowledge, that they might learn how the finless ones ease the burdens of troubling mothers. As you are indeed responsible for this state of affairs, you consent to aid her.","After your audience, Naroshs Koal explains that he had sought you out for the very purpose of aiding the clutchmother. She is mother to all Ondo, and so he would do anything and everything to comfort her in her hour of need, and so he prays that you will be able to help him achieve this end."],"objectives":["Speak with Naroshs Koal outside the Ondo Cups.","Inspect the rotting debris.","Speak with Naroshs Koal.","Speak with Xeroshs Ooan.","Speak with Naroshs Koal."],"dialogue":[{"name":"NAROSHSKOAL","text":"Hail, finless one, and welcome to the Cupsss.

Before we ssspeak at length, there is something I would show to you. Let us leave behind the Cupsss and head due west. Come."},{"name":"NAROSHSKOAL","text":"These are relics of your kind, yesss? The leavings of a ship that sssailed the seas above long, long ago. They lie as they fell, untouched by any Ondo, for most have little interest in the affairs of the finless."},{"name":"NAROSHSKOAL","text":"I, however, do. Ever sssince I was saved by one of yours, after being washed ashore, weary and near death. Sssuch kindnesss is a rare and wonderful thing, and I would know more of the people who showed it to me."},{"name":"NAROSHSKOAL","text":"And so I ask you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span>, to teach me of your ways.

I have heard of these before. Do finless ones ssso delight in dulling their wits?"},{"name":"NAROSHSKOAL","text":"Ahh, how versatile. Ondo too often utilize sssimple objects as tools─stone and bone and such. Our peoples are not so different..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Among the debris you spy what appears to be a rotting ship's wheel..."},{"name":"NAROSHSKOAL","text":"That was carved from the wood from one of your many trees, yes?

I see..."},{"name":"NAROSHSKOAL","text":"I sssee, I see! That possibility I had not considered. A pity that this material so quickly degrades when immersssed in water.

Here in the depths she will give birth to many, many eggs. We male Ondo will then take them into our care and raise them as our own."},{"name":"XEROSHSOOAN","text":"But absssent the flowing waters, we know not if she will be able to deliver them safely. If not, the future of our people will be in jeopardy."},{"name":"XEROSHSOOAN","text":"The Flood of Light claimed many Ondo lives.
