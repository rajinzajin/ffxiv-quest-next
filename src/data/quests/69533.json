After agreeing to her request, it is decided that your little group will assemble for departure at the Gridanian airship landing.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You meet with an elated Elyne at the airship landing and board the airship together. As she struggles to contain her excitement, the ever-dutiful Kupka explains that they must first pay a visit to the royal seneschal at the Ruby Road Exchange.","Upon your arrival, you make straight for the Ruby Road Exchange and the royal seneschal. Just before the Songbirds arrive to accept their fan letters, however, Astrid delivers a missive of her own─it seems that Lisette would take advantage of the close timing of Valentione's Day and Little Ladies' Day to host a joint event of some kind. It is then that Elyne suggests that the performers don Valentione-styled costumes, a proposal which is received enthusiastically by all involved. An excited Astrid immediately offers to return to Gridania to make the necessary arrangements. In the meantime, the seneschal wonders if you would be willing to lend him a helping hand...","You indicate your willingness to help, and the royal seneschal outlines his errand─a simple delivery to Frondale's Phrontistery. Once there, he asks that you seek out Lady Aldiytha in the children's ward and place the package in her hands.","Elyne, giddy at her first adventurer-like task, discovers that her delivery was actually a gift of sweets for the patients of the children's ward. Lady Aldiytha encourages her to help hand them out, and Elyne and Kupka enjoy spending time with some newly made friends. With the job complete, Kupka suggests you return to the seneschal and see if Astrid has arrived with the costumes.","The seneschal informs you that Astrid has indeed returned and is helping the Songbirds into their new outfits. You accompany Elyne to the stage and, following the performance, the three singers impart some words of wisdom to the would-be adventurer. It is almost time for the young lady to head home...","Although ready to leave, Elyne is already making plans for her next trip to Ul'dah. As you prepare to board the airship, however, Astrid mentions that Lisette would like to see everyone at the amphitheatre upon your return to Gridania.","You duly report to Lisette, and Elyne thanks you all effusively for making her dreams come true. Astrid and Kupka, too, are grateful for the experience, learning as they have that there is more to being an emissary than either one imagined. Pleased with her pupil's growth, Lisette reassures everyone that Valentione's Day─and the opportunity to spread more love and affection─is far from over!"],"objectives":["Wait at the airship landing in Gridania at the designated location.","Speak with the royal seneschal at the Ruby Road Exchange.","Speak with the royal seneschal once more.","Enter the children's ward at Frondale's Phrontistery and speak with Aldiytha.","Speak with the royal seneschal at the Ruby Road Exchange.","Speak with Elyne.","Speak with Lisette at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ELYNE","text":"You'll help me, then? Oh, thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"More than anything right now, I want to join Kupka on his trip to Ul'dah."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"The problem is, I'm afraid my parents will be too worried to let me go. But if they knew that <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> were going with me..."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"This could be your first step on the road to adventure!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"So you're saying you'll come!? Wonderful! Oh, I have to tell my parents right away!"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"I shall be right behind you when you do, a voice of steady reassurance!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"I, too, would like to see this tale to its conclusion. One can hardly abandon the ship of love ere it docks safely in the harbor!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Before we leave for Ul'dah, however, I should report to Lisette the reason for my continued absence. Let us convene at the airship landing when we are ready to depart!"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"I really must deliver these letters...but I am curious to hear the nature of this favor, kupo!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Elyne is happy and our work is done. Or so I thought! Pray lend the young lady your ear, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"They said yes! Kupka helped me convince them!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Wonderful! And might I say, you look very smart in your traveling clothes!"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Yes, it is all very exciting, but let us not forget your promise to return within the agreed-upon time, kupo! All aboard for Ul'dah! Once we arrive, I must speak with the royal seneschal at the Ruby Road Exchange."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Elyne seems to be enjoying herself, kupo! Perhaps we can see more of the city once I've tended to my duties."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Such a big and noisy place! And look at all these buildings! Do they make <span class=\"emphasis\">everything</span> out of stone, here?"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"In case you were wondering, Little Ladies' Day was close to overlapping with Valentione's Day this year, so they decided to go ahead with the former here in Ul'dah to avoid a collision of festivals."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"Oho! We meet again, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>! You have been keeping well, I trust?"},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"Well met, adventurer! I am the royal seneschal, and it is my great pleasure and privilege to oversee the joyous events of Little Ladies' Day."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"My dear seneschal, how time does pass us by, kupo! I come once more, bearing letters of love for the Songbirds."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"And how eagerly do they await your arrival, dear Kupka! Our lovely ladies are presently occupied with rehearsals for their upcoming performance, but they should be back any moment. ...Ahem, are these fine people <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> your assistants?"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Ah, how remiss of me, kupo! Allow me to make the introductions..."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"But isn't this fitting! Why, it's as if <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> is acting as seneschal for this darling young princess!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Yes! Exactly! And even as a Little Ladies' Day wish is coming true, so, too, are we fulfilling a mission of love for Valentione's Day. Two wonderful celebrations, joyfully coinciding..."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"...Oh, which reminds me! I have a missive here for you from Lisette, our eminent emissary of romance and affection."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"...Hmmm. Seeing as our respective festivals are set to take place at much the same time, the Lady Valentione proposes a joint event of some manner."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"This is indeed a rare opportunity, and one too precious to be squandered. But what might be suitable, I wonder..."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"(-???-)By the gods, I need a bath! But I'd say we're all ready for the big show!"},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"Ah, ladies! Kupka Kupp is here with your mail."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"I have a bundle for each of you, kupo!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"I thought for certain I would have the biggest pile this time! Why is it we always receive the <span class=\"emphasis\">exact same</span> number of fan letters!?"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Well, I think it's nice... We're all equally loved!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Besides, it's about the content, not the quantity. All those words of admiration and encouragement..."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"This fan writes, “I can hardly wait to see your next performance, not to mention your newest outfits.” ...Gods, we haven't even decided what to do with our costumes."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"“A new look for a new us” was the idea, but if we don't come up with something soon, we'll be taking to the stage in what we're wearing now."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"What about the Valentione's Day costumes? I think they're really adorable!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Elyne! That's a splendid idea! We could easily sew the same pattern using fabric in the Songbirds' signature colors─red, blue, and yellow."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"That <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> a splendid idea. A dash of Valentione flavor to spice up a Little Ladies' confection! It'll be the talk of the town!"},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"Well now, it would seem Lisette's desire for a joint event has found its answer."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Indeed! I shall return to Gridania to arrange the costumes and report the good news."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"Pray take your ease, ladies. I will inform you once the new outfits have arrived."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"And what are your own plans? If you aren't otherwise occupied, might I ask for a helping hand whilst you await the return of your companion? There would be no rush─you could even complete the task as you take a tour of the city. What say you?"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Would you like to know why the Songbirds always receive an equal number of fan letters? Me too, kupo..."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"I wonder what kind of task the seneschal wants us to do. Let's ask him!"},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"It is a simple errand, really: I've a single delivery that I should like you to make to the children's ward at Frondale's Phrontistery."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"We're to be trusted with a delivery!? I feel like an adventurer already!"},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"Oho, you've set your sights on becoming an adventurer, have you? Well then, Mistress Elyne, we must reward you accordingly: whatever portion of my delivery remains “unclaimed” shall be yours to keep. How does that sound?"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Y-You can count on me, sir! Um...what is this “children's ward” exactly, anyway?"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"From what I understand, 'tis a place where little ones around your age are sent to recover from illness, kupo."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"There will be a lady there by the name of Aldiytha. Put the package directly into her hands, if you please."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Yes, sir! On our way, sir!"},{"name":"ALCHEMIST03850","text":"A delivery from the royal seneschal, is it? The children's ward is right through here."},{"name":"Q1","text":"Enter the children's ward?"},{"name":"ALDIYTHA","text":"...I see! Well, you have my thanks, my little adventurer, as do your friends."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"If I may ask, Lady Aldiytha, where are all the children? I hadn't expected the ward to be so quiet, kupo..."},{"name":"ALDIYTHA","text":"They're with the physicians, undergoing a scheduled examination. We put up decorations whilst they're away, you see, ready to surprise them upon their return!"},{"name":"ALDIYTHA","text":"These sweets you've brought us from the seneschal are part of the celebrations. Perhaps you might like to stay and help hand them out?"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Oh! I would like that very much!"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Handing out sweets is an act of love, and very much in keeping with Valentione's Day tradition. As an emissary, it would be my duty and my joy, kupo!"},{"name":"DAMIELLIOT","text":"I was aware of plans to decorate the ward, but I did not expect we would be welcoming such delightful visitors as well."},{"name":"DAMIELLIOT","text":"Look how happy the children are to meet Mistress Elyne and Master Kupka. It is not often they get to make new friends of their own age, not to mention a different city, so this is quite a special occasion."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Lady Aldiytha gave me the leftover sweets as a reward! I guess that means we finished the job the seneschal gave us."},{"name":"ALDIYTHA","text":"And a fine job it was. I shall be staying here with the children for a time, so might I ask that you convey my regards to the seneschal?"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Of course! We should be getting back in any case, kupo! Astrid will surely have returned by now."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"I don't see Astrid, kupo..."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"We should tell the seneschal we made his delivery...shouldn't we?"},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"Thank you for delivering that most important cargo. And how is the Lady Aldiytha? Will she be joining us for the festivities?"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"She said she needed to stay with the children for the moment. Oh, but she did let me have the rest of the sweets, just like you promised!"},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"But of course! It is only fair you be paid for services rendered."},{"name":"BUTLER","text":"As for your companion, Mistress Astrid returned a short while ago with the promised costumes, and is assisting the Songbirds with the fitting. The ladies will be mounting the stage momentarily─you'll stay to watch their performance, of course?"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Ladies and gentlemen! Welcome, and thank you for coming to our concert!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Valentione's Day festivities are in full swing, and now, here in Ul'dah, Little Ladies' Day has taken over the city! This is our chance to have double the fun!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Have you all noticed our Valentione-themed costumes? This performance is dedicated to the ideals of both festivals, and we mean to give our emissary friends a run for their money! Prepare to feel the love!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"The Songbirds are so amazing...and pretty...and lovely!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"It's no wonder they're so popular! With the way they can stir people's hearts, we may have to appoint them as honorary emissaries..."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"I certainly feel inadequate after that performance, kupo. Perhaps I'm not as wise in the ways of love as I thought."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Did you see how much the crowd loved our outfits, Elyne!? We have you and your friends to thank for that!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"I was just saying how pretty you three looked. I'm so glad it went well!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"I don't know when, or even if, I'll ever be a real adventurer, but this trip to Ul'dah felt like a great start─going on a journey, and helping out the seneschal..."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Oh, you want to be an adventurer? You must be very brave!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Chasing a dream is no easy feat, especially ones that take a great deal of training and dedication. Sometimes they seem so far away...but we reach for them all the same, don't we?"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"That's because having a dream is the best thing there is! Sure, there'll be times when you feel it's all too hard, but remember to keep that fire inside burning bright!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Exactly! And don't you ever say “if”! Stick with “when”! Your dream will always be there, waiting. Put one foot in front of the other, and you'll get there in the end."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Praise yourself whenever you make it even one step further than the day before. That's what I do! It builds confidence, and helps you stay positive."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"I will! Thank you...all of you."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"I'll never stop chasing my dream..."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"We had best be getting Elyne back home, kupo! Her parents will be expecting her!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"“Your dream will always be there, waiting.” Now isn't that a reassuring thought?"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"I suppose I better be heading home...but when I next come to Ul'dah, I'll have to bring some Twelveswood flowers for the children's ward."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"I'm sure they would love that, kupo! And it would be nice to have a longer chat with our new friends."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Shall we board the airship, then? Lisette wished to see us upon our return, so pray join me at the amphitheatre if you have time."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Welcome back, everyone! Our dear Astrid explained all the excitement when she came to arrange the costumes."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"I am so pleased to see you lifted out of that gloomy mood, Elyne! And I really must thank you for your excellent suggestion!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Oh, Lady Lisette, you should have seen the Songbirds in their Valentione outfits─they were adorable!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I never would have braved any of this if it weren't for you!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Now, if an adventurer helps you, you're supposed to give them a reward. I'll have to ask Mother and Father what we can spare..."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Your kind words were enough."},{"name":"A2","text":"Don't worry about it. It was nothing."},{"name":"A3","text":"Forget about it for now..."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Hm? You mean my letter!? But that was only─ That hardly seems fair!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"It wasn't nothing! I <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> repay you for this! Someday... "},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Fine. But only for now! Once I start making my way in the world, I'll repay you for everything!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"...Well, I really should be going now. Please know that I'll never forget this for as long as I live!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Thank you, Kupka, for encouraging me to write that letter. I always enjoy our talks in the wood."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"And thank you, Astrid, for staying with me until the end! I'll come to see you as often as I can before Valentione's Day is over."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"And I can never thank <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> enough, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I dream of the day we can travel together again!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"I know I was on a mission of love for Elyne, and yet somehow I feel I gained as much from the experience as she did."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"I thought I understood what being an emissary was all about, but there is so much more. You were right, Lisette─I was trying to dash through the garden, when I should have stopped to count the petals..."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Well, that's one way of putting it. But at least now you know what you don't know, and that's at least two-thirds of the journey!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"If I could bring as much joy as even one-third of the Songbirds, I would be happy!"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Well, I shall be learning right alongside you, Astrid. It wouldn't do to have a fledgling outdo me, kupo!"},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Fear not, my eager emissaries! Valentione's Day is not over yet, and there's still plenty of love to spread around!"}],"reward":{"items":[{"id":32803}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}],"quests":[69532]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1035244","obj":{"i":1035244,"n":"Elyne","l":55,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1035151","obj":{"i":1035151,"n":"Lisette De Valentione","l":53,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"32803","obj":{"i":32803,"n":"Lovely Moogle Cap","l":1,"c":41519,"t":34,"p":1500}},{"type":"quest","id":"69532","obj":{"i":69532,"n":"A Delivery of Love","g":197,"l":"Gridania","s":200}}]}
