Bring the trader a chicken egg to coax him into spilling the goods.","After receiving the chicken egg, Kyokyoroon is more than happy to tell you that Teteroon has since moved on to barter his wares at a trading post elsewhere. However, he cannot recall where said trading post is, and instead directs you to a man named Wineburg at the Lominsan ferry docks, who he believes knows Teteroon's whereabouts.","Wineburg recalls only that Teteroon rode the ferry to Aleport, and nothing beyond that. Should you decide to continue your search there, he advises you to speak with a man named Ahldfoet.","According to Ahldfoet, Teteroon headed north into upper La Noscea, most likely in search of Memeroon's Trading Post. Proceed to the outpost and present Teteroon with his forgotten scarlet earring.","You have delivered the scarlet earring to Teteroon. Reminded of Buscarron, he promptly lapses into nostalgic reminiscences of former days."],"objectives":["<span class=\"highlight-yellow\">* This quest has been adjusted.
