{"quest":{"name":"An Othardian Wolfman in Gridania","location":"Gridania","id":68547,"patch":4.1,"sort":144,"icon":100734,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1024523,"target":1024532,"genre":203,"journal":["An investigator for the Adventurers' Guild appears to be more than a little concerned.<br>※This quest is available for a limited time only.","It is a day like any other in Gridania, except that a wolfman from Doma has wandered into the city and expressed a desire to join the Continental Circus. Said circus is, of course, no place for any good-hearted individual─beastman or otherwise─and the investigator is desperate to save the Lupin from a life of devilry. For lack of a better plan, he begs you to join the Continental Circus along with the Doman traveler.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","Soga, the Lupin come from distant Doma, is pleased to make your acquaintance and pleasantly surprised that you do not regard him with fear and uncertainty like so many others. He explains that he wishes to turn his uncommon appearance to his advantage by joining the troupe, where he believes he will be welcomed with open arms and be rich in “nakama” or some such. Yet all who wish to become a member of the Continental Circus must first receive the blessing of the Impresario...","The Impresario is delighted to receive you and Soga, stating that he is more than willing to permit you to join. First, however, you must complete a simple task. To wit, you must frighten several Gridanians for reasons the Impresario is quick to obfuscate. While Soga may use his gods-given gifts to accomplish this, you must rely on other means provided by the Continental Circus: a guise of the werewolf, which you may use to assume a rather more beastly form!"],"objectives":["Speak with Soga.","Speak with the Impresario."],"dialogue":[{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"Ah, it's you! The kind adventurer who helped us before! I do hope you'll forgive me for imposing upon you once more, but we have something of an unprecedented situation here..."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"You are an adventurer, yes, and an experienced one besides? Ah, Twelve be praised! We could do with the assistance of a <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> such as yourself..."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"You see, a wolfman claiming to have come from distant Doma wishes to join the Continental Circus!"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"Now, don't get me wrong─it's a fine thing the troupe does, going around Eorzea's great cities and livening up the various All Saints' Wake festivities. But I would never encourage someone to throw their lot in with the fiends!"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"And that's no exaggeration either. Mark me, friend: they're demons! Honest-to-gods monsters who delight in terrorizing decent folk like you and me!"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"...Though, to be fair, that mostly amounts to the occasional prank, like stealing your socks or spilling your drink when you're not looking. Still, there's no telling when they'll get a taste for blacker deeds!"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"I told all this and more to the wolfman, of course, but he just looked at me like I'd been quaffing milkroot all morning. Aye, at this rate, I fear there's nothing we can do to save him from a life of devilry..."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"Wait, I've got an idea! It's a little convoluted, but...if you and our Far Eastern friend joined the Continental Circus <span class=\"emphasis\">together</span>, you could keep him from committing any truly unspeakable evils!"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"Yes, yes, that makes about as much sense as anything. By the by, the wolfman's name is Soga. He's quite sociable, so don't be hesitant to, say, wander over to the Whistling Miller and approach him without prompting."},{"name":"SOGA","text":"You...you do not fear me, Eorzean?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"I've had dealings with beastmen before."},{"name":"A1","text":"Oh, I'm quaking in my boots."},{"name":"SOGA","text":"Would that more of your kinsmen could say the same. Most here regard me with suspicion, if not outright fear."},{"name":"SOGA","text":"Are you, now... Nevertheless, you have mustered the courage to speak with me, and for that I am grateful. Others make a concerted effort to pretend I am not here, as if my very presence is an affront to their Matron."},{"name":"SOGA","text":"I have found myself with more freedom to travel since the liberation of my homeland, and so I thought to come to Eorzea. Such is the reason for my being here, but what is yours for seeking me out?"},{"name":"SOGA","text":"With the aid of my countrymen I came to Gridania by way of Revenant's Toll. Such is the reason for my being here, but what is yours for seeking me out?"},{"name":"SOGA","text":"You too wish to join the Continental Circus? Ho, what fortune! I thought perhaps you were an associate of that nosy adventurer who attempted to deter me from my course..."},{"name":"SOGA","text":"Wheresoever I go in these lands, I am feared. Men avert their gaze, women cross the road to avoid me, children burst into tears."},{"name":"SOGA","text":"That, however, is my experience as a humble traveler. As a member of the Continental Circus, on the other hand, I would be lauded for this “talent,” would I not?"},{"name":"SOGA","text":"No longer would I be scorned and alone─nay, I would be rich in “nakama,” as the Hingans say. We too could be nakama!"},{"name":"SOGA","text":"Ah, but I am getting ahead of myself! I have yet to even ask you your name."},{"name":"SOGA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, is it? It is an honor and a pleasure. Now, then─let us go and greet the Impresario!"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"It shouldn't be too hard to find Soga. Just stand around at a crossroads or some such and keep an eye out for, well...a wolfman!"},{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"Well, well, well. Two wanderers who wish to join our esteemed troupe of tricksters. Yet what is this strange sense of familiarity? Perchance naught more than a figment of my imagination, but...never mind."},{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"Well, well, well. Two wanderers who wish to join our esteemed troupe of tricksters. I cannot help but wonder at your motives, but it matters not in the end─if you truly yearn to strike fear into the hearts of your fellow man, that is enough."},{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"This year we will throw open the doors of our haunted manor once more, and as we have our hands full with the preparations, we would be fools to turn away you and your wolfman associate."},{"name":"SOGA","text":"Then you will permit us to join the Continental Circus? Just like that? Kami be praised! I am grateful to you beyond measure, good sir, and should be glad to assist you in any way you desire!"},{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"My, such enthusiasm! Very well, let us begin with a simple task─a test of your skills, rather, in which you shall attempt to frighten several subjects, sowing seeds of terror into their─ahem─thereby showing them a jolly good time."},{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"Afterwards, you may then encourage them to join in the fun as well, though... Hmm. That said, your comparatively plain disposition will not serve you well in this endeavor."},{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"Fortunately, we have the means to bestow upon you rather simliar wolflike features! Take it, with our blessings!"},{"name":"SOGA","text":"I wanted to let that adventurer know not to worry about me, so I gave a missive to one of those little postmen earlier. It twirled and said, “Thank you, kupo!”"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03011","text":"Soga wrote me a letter saying that the two of you were off to meet the Impresario? I'll leave you to it, then."}],"reward":{"items":[{"id":21104},{"id":21105}],"xp":3360},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}],"questsType":"any","quests":[65781,66211]},"next":[68548]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1024523","obj":{"i":1024523,"n":"Adventurers' Guild Investigator","l":53,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1024532","obj":{"i":1024532,"n":"Impresario","l":53,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"21104","obj":{"i":21104,"n":"Werewolf Attire Chest for Men","l":1,"c":26509,"t":61}},{"type":"item","id":"21105","obj":{"i":21105,"n":"Werewolf Attire Chest for Women","l":1,"c":26509,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"65781","obj":{"i":65781,"n":"It's Probably Pirates","g":1,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":91}},{"type":"quest","id":"66211","obj":{"i":66211,"n":"It's Probably Pirates","g":0,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":91}},{"type":"quest","id":"68548","obj":{"i":68548,"n":"The Adventurer Who Cried Wolfman","g":203,"l":"Gridania","s":145}}]}
