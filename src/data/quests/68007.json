Could it be─ Yes, could it just possibly be the scent of whispered secrets waiting to be overheard?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I do not like the cut of that man's jib. Not one bit."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Beautiful though it may be, we cannot spend all day staring at the aetheryte."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Come, come, let us move along. The markets are next!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"No sign of Gosetsu or Yugiri here. Not that I expected to stumble across them just like that. Though it would have been nice..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Just look at all these garish designs... Not fond of subtlety, are they.<br>Hm, is that a theater over there?"},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Be still my heart!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well, well. I would expect no less of a bustling port..."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"We have arrived at the largest shopping district in Kugane: Kogane Dori!"},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"\"Kugane,“ as you are doubtless unaware, is an ancient Hingan word for gold. So, in this prosperous port where golden fortunes are made, lesser fortunes, or ”kogane,“ are earned by the local merchants. It's all quite logical once you learn the language."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Heh heh heh... Now you're beginning to speak <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> language..."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Oho! A kindred spirit! What a pleasure it is to meet a young lady who appreciates the value of hard-won coin!"},{"name":"KEITEN","text":"(-???-)Hancock of the East Aldenard Trading Company. You are with clients today?"},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Why, if it isn't Master Keiten! Pray allow me to introduce to you my esteemed guests, but recently come from distant Eorzea."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"This kind and generous soul supervises all transactions here in Kogane Dori."},{"name":"KEITEN","text":"Your sincerity is ever appreciated. As he says, I am Keiten of the Hakuuchi clan, and it is my honor to serve as overseer of these markets."},{"name":"KEITEN","text":"As we receive many foreign visitors in Kugane, we accept all manner of currencies. Rest assured, your Eorzean gil are welcome here. I invite you to peruse our wares at your leisure."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Arms, armor, foodstuffs, potables─here you will find all of them and more."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Where to next, I wonder?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Hmm... We're actually quite far from the docks now, aren't we. This place is bigger than I thought."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Don't think I haven't memorized every detail of that street! There's at least half a dozen shops that will soon be enjoying my custom!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Hmm...the district up ahead has a different air about it."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"If we may pause here for a moment..."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"This road leads to the Ijin-gai: the district in which “ijin”─or <span class=\"emphasis\">foreigners</span>─are permitted to reside."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Would this also be where the foreign embassies are found─including that of a certain empire?"},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Precisely. So you see, it would not be at all unusual to cross paths with one of our Garlean cousins here. With this in mind, I would encourage you to choose your words carefully. We would not want any physical altercations, after all, such spats being <span class=\"emphasis\">strictly</span> forbidden!"},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"The Sekiseigumi punish breaches of the peace quite severely. I have seen foreigners permanently exiled for a single violation─though, to be fair, this is not common. More often than not, they are executed on the spot."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"What, cut down then and there!? You're joking, right?"},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Would that I were, but alas, these samurai are a humorless lot."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Why, I recall one instance when a foreign merchant in his cups dared lay hands upon a Hingan aristocrat in front of a Sekiseigumi. The samurai cut him in half with a single stroke."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Ugh, I don't even want to think about that..."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"So, as you see, it would behoove you to behave. Failing that, we may be forced to “part ways” with one another─or you with yourselves, in the manner of the late Teledji Adeledji!"},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"...Oh, how I amuse myself. But we must carry on! I have yet to show you the Garlean Consulate!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"So that building's full of Garleans..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Some might call it unwise to loiter outside the gates of a hostile empire's consulate."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Danger! Excitement! Intrigue! Oh, my!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Compared to the Hingan architecture, this seems drab and uninspired. Or mayhap I have simply had my fill of Garlean aesthetics, such as they are."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"This, as you may have surmised, is the consulate of you-know-who. Mark the guards at the gate─are their uniforms not different from those you have seen in the West?"},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Were you to travel far and wide, you would find that many such variations exist, often inspired by local designs. All of which goes to show that even a massive empire seeking to rule all of creation is not without its artisans!"},{"name":"EATCASSISTANT","text":"Greetings, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, and welcome to the Kugane branch offices of the East Aldenard Trading Company.
