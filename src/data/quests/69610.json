One of the Lemures has sent word that a hungry beast threatens his operations in Cutter's Cry. Seeking both to aid a member of her family and get you familiar with the tools of your trade, Drusilla bids you accompany her to Cutter's Cry and combat this threat.","Arnegis explains that the area through which he transports goods has been plagued by a chimera, a beast far too ferocious for him and his crew to drive off alone. Drusilla seems confident that you can defeat it.","Issuing a few helpful hints to guide you toward murderous ends, Drusilla sends you off into the sandpit to draw blood─and the chimera's attention. But will you and your scythe be up to the challenge?","The deed is done, and Drusilla is impressed. She shares with you the story of how reapers came to be─how when driven from their ancestral homeland by invaders, her Garlean forebears were forced to turn to pacts with fell voidsent in order to survive. Although the strength they gained was great, it came at cost and with risks, but such were the depths of their desperation. She leaves you to think upon the lesson of this tale and asks you to return to Lemures headquarters at your leisure.<br><br>※In the event that you leave Lemures headquarters, you may re-enter by speaking with the loyal Lemure in Pearl Lane.","The Lemures were formed to support Garleans living in exile, as Drusilla explains. She encourages you to think about their perspective, but reminds you that regardless of whether or not you sympathize with them and their plight, she expects you to spare no effort in the pursuit of your prey. She and the other Lemures will be gathering information on the voidsent's whereabouts. In the meantime, Drusilla asks that you hone your skills until further information is uncovered.<br><br>※The next reaper quest will be available from Drusilla upon reaching level 73."],"objectives":["Speak with Arnegis near Cutter's Cry.","Speak with Drusilla.","Speak with Drusilla at Lemures headquarters."],"dialogue":[{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"How do you find the weight of the scythe in your hands? Pleasin', I hope. Now that we have a bit more in common, it's time we became better acquainted. What's the name of our newest reaper?"},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>... Hmm, doesn't quite roll off the tongue, but so it is with Eorzean names. With every new one I learn, one more is forgotten."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Yours can replace Jijilyo. After our little conversation, I think he'll give us a wide berth."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Anyroad, we've more worthwhile concerns than shifty merchants. Namely, gettin' you conversed well and proper in the tricks of our trade. And the best way to do that is through battle."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"One of the family is havin' trouble with a particularly vexin' fiend, and has sent word askin' for assistance."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"He goes by the name of Arnegis, and he's stationed out near Cutter's Cry. Not much of a fighter, but he's got a keen mind for trade and can find a needle in a stack of needles if need be. We'd best hurry before he ends up at the bottom of some monster's gullet."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, say hello to Arnegis. It's not his real name, of course─he's as Garlean as we come. But I'd say he makes a passable Highlander in the correct light."},{"name":"ARNEGIS","text":"Boss, who's this? Are you sure we should be getting an outsider involved?"},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Thank you for your discretion, Arnegis, but it ain't needed. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span> has a personal contract with me, so consider <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> a mercenary in service to the family. Whatever you'd say in front of me, you can say in front of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>."},{"name":"ARNEGIS","text":"By your will, Boss. A chimera has been making these sands a living hell for anyone who dares to wander into its territory─which'd be us, since our trade route cuts right through it."},{"name":"ARNEGIS","text":"The men I've hired to carry my goods are scared to death, and I can't blame them. None of us are fit for monster hunting, so I sent for you."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"We'll see what we can do, Arnegis. Might want to find a rock to hide behind, though. Chimeras ain't known for bein' the most discriminatin' of beasts."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Time to put your new skills to good use, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have learned all reaper actions and traits to level 70. Detailed descriptions can be viewed in the <span class=\"highlight\">Actions & Traits</span> window, accessed under <span class=\"highlight\">Character</span> in the main menu."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Ready, are we?"},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Bloody impressive work, that."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"I knew there was somethin' about you, but truth be told I didn't expect you to make such clean work of that chimera. I reckon even I might be hard-pressed to match that display."},{"name":"ARNEGIS","text":"You know talent when you see it, Boss. And with that, the ceruleum will flow once more."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Among his many roles, Arnegis is a merchant of sorts. He sells ceruleum at a price that'd make those gil-pinchers at Amajina & Sons balk, but still turns a pretty profit. We can barely keep up with demand, despite the occasional beast or two buttin' into our affairs."},{"name":"ARNEGIS","text":"All thanks to you, Boss─and our countrymen up north, of course. Here's to getting back to business as usual."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Ceruleum ain't easy to come by. Amajina & Sons protects their monopoly with a gilded fist, but there's one place they can't touch: the imperial refinery to the north."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Ceruleum ain't easy to come by, as you well know. Amajina & Sons protects their monopoly with a gilded fist, but they've yet to force the imperial stragglers up north out of the market."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Now, before you go runnin' off to the Flames, let me assure you that this arrangement is entirely above board. Sellin' goods to imperials is forbidden by law, but there's nary a word writ about <span class=\"emphasis\">buyin'</span> from 'em."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"I know you Eorzeans like to call Garleans by all sorts of colorful names. Bastards, tyrants, invaders. And aye, we've got all those and worse."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"But while many a foul deed has been committed for the glory of the Empire, we ain't megalomaniacs to a man. Even amongst the purebloods, those that serve don't always do so by choice. Could be argued we're all casualties of the great machina's ambition."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"No small number of the Empire's troops would return home in a heartbeat if they could. But the world bein' what it is, most settle for sendin' their family what few coins they can afford to part with."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Most Eorzeans wouldn't suffer a whit of color to complicate their black-and-white view. But if you're going to fight with us, you should learn the truth of our past."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Long ago, long before the Empire, our forebears lived in Locus Amoenus, down in southern Ilsabard."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"With temperate climes and fertile earth, the land provided. Many of us were but simple farmers, harvestin' abundant crops with the selfsame scythes the reapers would eventually wield."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"But gifts are ever the object of envy. When not tillin' the fields, our ancestors were forced to defend them. Every year they yielded a few more ilms, and some eight hundred years ago now they were driven from Locus Amoenus completely."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"They fled north, to the frozen region that would become Garlemald. Even there, they fought tooth and nail for the scant resources of that frigid land."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"From the fires of hardship were the first magitek devices forged, and with innovation upon innovation that humble group of farmers grew into an insatiable empire."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"But before that miraculous twist of fate, we were a dying breed, bereft not only of magic but of hope itself. With no natural advantages to speak of, our mere survival was in question."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"From harsh necessity were the reapers born. We turned our tools to weapons and struck a bargain with the whispers in the dark. With the void's power, we could strike at an army's beatin' heart─slay their generals and throw the rank and file into disarray."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Our way is to end battles before the sparks catch, to sacrifice the one for the many. To keep avaricious hands away from family, friends, and lovers. And now this power belongs to you."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Remember our story. Remember what drives a <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> to turn to the void, and you'll not be led unto deeper temptations."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Our work here is done. I'll see you back at headquarters."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"For your first outin', you did good. I think you've earned the right to know just who this lot you've thrown yourself in with is."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"You might've gathered this yourself, but the Lemures were formed to support those Garleans who are livin' in exile."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"'Tain't easy to be far from home, let alone in a place where most would sooner gut you than offer a helpin' hand. Oft the only place to make a livin' is in the shadowy corners that lie outside the watchful gaze of the law."},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"Now, I don't expect you to embrace us like brothers and sisters straightaway. But know this: I <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> expect you to apply yourself to this job. "},{"name":"DRUSILLA","text":"In the meantime, I'll be workin' with the family to ascertain the whereabouts of our prey. I expect that scythe to be like an extension of your own body when next we speak."}],"reward":{"gil":2343},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":180}],"quests":[69609]},"next":[69611]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1037014","obj":{"i":1037014,"n":"Drusilla","l":4022,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1036629","obj":{"i":1036629,"n":"Drusilla","l":4022,"q":4}},{"type":"quest","id":"69609","obj":{"i":69609,"n":"The Killer Instinct","g":165,"l":"Ul'dah","s":700,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69611","obj":{"i":69611,"n":"On the Hunt","g":165,"l":"Ul'dah","s":730,"f":1}}]}
