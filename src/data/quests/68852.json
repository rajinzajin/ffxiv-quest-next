You...you would be my patron!?"},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"But...I can't do anything for you. The lawless ones took my invisible ink, and without it I can't make my arcane wares."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"Who are the lawless ones? They're Nu Mou like us, except they've turned their backs on our values. Curs without honor, they are."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"They refuse to work, instead spending all their time cavorting and making a nuisance of themselves. It was when I was outside for a walk that they set upon me and robbed me of my possessions, the ink included."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"I was too weak to resist them...but you, mortal─you look quite strong. Do you think you could take my ink back from those villains?"},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"If you do this, I will consider it your patronage. And by way of my service, I will make you something very special!"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"E-Excuse me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but I couldn't help overhearing. If you mean to undertake this task, will you let me accompany you?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I would learn from you...and help in what little way I can."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You're welcome to join."},{"name":"A1","text":"Just don't get in the way."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Thank you so much!"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Thank you! I promise I won't be a burden!"},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"The lawless ones make their lair to the south, inside a cave called Father Collard's Chambers. They took many vials of ink, and I would be grateful if you could bring as many back as possible."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"The lawless ones make their lair to the south, inside a cave called Father Collard's Chambers. When they see you, they're like to attack on sight, so please take care!"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Father Collard's Chambers is through here. I peered inside, and sure enough, it was milling with Nu Mou. They looked none too friendly."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"If Thancred were here, he'd tell me to go about it quietly and quickly. Let us split up."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I'll find all the ink I can and then come back outside. See you shortly, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"WYDAENC","text":"Still offering your patronage to us? When you have a moment, I would speak with you all."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"M-M-Mercy, Your Majesty! We had no choice! Please forgive us!"},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"...O-Oh, it's you. M-M-My ink─were you able to retrieve it?"},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"Haha! Yes, this is the ink, and almost all of it too!"},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"When our king spoke to me, my day went from bad to worse, but thanks to you it's simply bad again!"},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"What? You had the vision too? Oh, woe is us..."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"Ordinarily, when a living being turns into a sin eater, it loses everything about its mind that defined it. However, the king has retained some of their instincts."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"This manifests in the desire to play and be free. So strong is that desire, it often leaks through the seal to invade our consciousness."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"For a long time we've ignored it, but we can't do so forever..."},{"name":"WYDLAD","text":"But forgive me, I was going to thank you for reuniting me with my ink. You did exactly as I asked, so I will give you the service I promised.<br>...Ahem! Nothing up my sleeve, and...voilà! May it serve you well!"}],"reward":{"gil":460,"items":[{"num":3,"id":7569}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":73,"id":142}],"quests":[68851]},"next":[68853,68944,68945,68946,68947,68948,68949,68950,68951,68952,68953,68954]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1027672","obj":{"i":1027672,"n":"Wyd Lad","l":2956,"q":3}},{"type":"item","id":"7569","obj":{"i":7569,"n":"Aetheryte Ticket","l":1,"c":25918,"t":63}},{"type":"quest","id":"68851","obj":{"i":68851,"n":"Spore Sweeper","g":8,"l":"Il Mheg","s":370}},{"type":"quest","id":"68853","obj":{"i":68853,"n":"The Elder's Answer","g":8,"l":"Il Mheg","s":390}},{"type":"quest","id":"68944","obj":{"i":68944,"n":"Scents of Security","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3001}},{"type":"quest","id":"68945","obj":{"i":68945,"n":"A Lawful Trade","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3010}},{"type":"quest","id":"68946","obj":{"i":68946,"n":"The Mushroom Menace","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3020}},{"type":"quest","id":"68947","obj":{"i":68947,"n":"Growing Pla Enni","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3030}},{"type":"quest","id":"68948","obj":{"i":68948,"n":"Much Ado About Giving","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3040}},{"type":"quest","id":"68949","obj":{"i":68949,"n":"Help My Porxie","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3050}},{"type":"quest","id":"68950","obj":{"i":68950,"n":"One Good Trick Deserves Another","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3060}},{"type":"quest","id":"68951","obj":{"i":68951,"n":"A Leafman and a Hero","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3070}},{"type":"quest","id":"68952","obj":{"i":68952,"n":"Magic Is Love, Magic Is Life","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3080}},{"type":"quest","id":"68953","obj":{"i":68953,"n":"Are You Being Served","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3090}},{"type":"quest","id":"68954","obj":{"i":68954,"n":"A Stranger Fuath","g":116,"l":"Il Mheg","s":3100}}]}
