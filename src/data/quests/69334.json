Should you be inclined to heed its call, seek out Chaqurl Qhotl and see how you might best proceed.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","You speak with Qitarl Natl, who shares with you further gleanings from the excavation of the flooded tunnels, and Chaqurl Qhotl, who laments the sad fate of the catfish people who once crossed paths with his ancestors. But there is more troubling news at hand─Towarl Manol's symptoms have returned with a vengeance, and the sickness that afflicts her appears to be spreading about the Stopple. At the behest of the Qitari father and son, you resolve to travel to Fanow in their stead to acquire an additional supply of medicine from your Viis friends.","Master Lanille in Fanow is more than happy to provide you the medicine the Qitari require, but with it comes grim tidings─a malady similar to that which plagues the Qitari appears to have afflicted the Viis as well. Deeply concerned for the well-being of your forest-dwelling friends, you set off for the Stopple once more, hoping that the remedy will provide a temporary respite from the suffering until such time as a cure can be found.","Your return to the Stopple is greeted with grim news when Chaqurl Qhotl informs you that the sickness has spread in your absence, leaving even Qitarl Natl bedridden. As the young Qitari struggles to come to grips with the situation, Quinfort rushes to the scene in a panic and confirms your worst fears─the Night's Blessed of Slitherbough, too, have been stricken with the strange sickness, and your friend Valan lies unconscious in bed as you speak. Deeply distressed at this turn of events─and at the thought that the Qitari themselves might be responsible for spreading the disease around the Greatwood—Chaqurl resigns himself to calling off the excavation effort until a cure can be found, but is convinced otherwise by a timely interruption from the Great Serpent of Ronka. Believing this to be a sign that the very answer he seeks might be found in the tunnels below, he proclaims that the excavation will go on. Admiring the Qitari child's courage and composure in trying times, you resolve to speak to him and give him the encouragement he needs to go exploring without his father at his side.","Having descended into the tunnels with the great serpent at his side, Chaqurl Qhotl returns to the surface alone, but with triumphant news─the fourth stela has been found. As the Qitari child tells it, unlike the previous three, it is in pristine condition, and the etchings upon it appear to provide the very answer that you seek. Guided by the divine wisdom of the great serpent, you resolve to scour the forest for the rare variety of Ronkan moss that may stay the spread of the terrible pox that now plagues the forest.","You succeed in harvesting the moss and delivering it safely to the Stopple. At Chaqurl Qhotl's direction, the remedy is brewed and swiftly administered to the sick, who begin to show immediate signs of recovery─just as foretold by the great serpent. Before long, Qitarl Natl is back on his feet, greatly relieving his son. You are curious to speak with the elder Steward and hear his thoughts about the spread of the mysterious sickness.","A recovered Qitarl Natl shares with you his theory on the spread of the disease, which he believes to have been an unfortunate side effect of the migration of his own people from the far-flung reaches of the forest. Troubled by the implications and yet taking heart that it was the wisdom of his forefathers that quelled the epidemic, he vows that the Stewards will be vigilant against any similar outbreaks in the future. With the four stelae finally unearthed and restored to their original form, the Qitari resolve to continue their excavation and study, that further lost knowledge may be gleaned."],"objectives":["Speak with Chaqurl Qhotl.","Speak with Lanille in Fanow, and obtain the medicine.","Deliver the medicine to Chaqurl Qhotl.","Speak with Chaqurl Qhotl.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mine a [Error] at the Husk</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver [Error] to Chaqurl Qhotl</span><span class=\"alternative\">Gather a [Error] at the Husk</span><span class=\"alternative\">Catch a [Error] in the Red Chalice</span></span>.","Speak with Qitarl Natl."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BOUSHITSUCHINOKO","text":"Scree...!?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The great serpent lets out a high-pitched squeal.

For I was able to locate the fourth stela myself! And─thanks be to the divine protector─there was barely a scratch or scrape on it!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Yes, using the tools and techniques you have supplied to us, I do believe we will be able to raise it to the surface in pristine condition!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Remarkable! Truly, you are a paragon of Ronkan industriousness and ingenuity! Now do tell─did the stone provide any new insights that might help us fend off the plague?"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Oh, Master Quinfort! You will see for yourself once we raise it to the surface, but let me tell you what I saw with my own eyes!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Pictured <span class=\"emphasis\">provident</span>-ly in the center was none other than the great serpent itself! Atop its head sat a gloriously large and fluffy green mass. Before the serpent, a man in Ronkan garb raised his hands in sheer <span class=\"emphasis\">julib</span>-ation!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Glorious! This is incontrovertible proof that the divine protector guided our ancestors to enlightenment just as it guides us today!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Sadly, Father is in no condition to share with us his thoughts on the carvings─but no matter! With the stela in im-<span class=\"emphasis\">pec</span>-ulate condition, I am confident that my in-<span class=\"emphasis\">pertritation</span> is the correct one!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Yes, there can be no doubting it! With a mighty “scree!”, the great serpent did bestow upon the Ronkan people a giant tuft of grass-green fluff, which cured them of a dreadful pox!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"No doubt it is to guide us to this very knowledge─the cure that would save our people─that the great serpent appeared before me!"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Glory be to the scree!"},{"name":"A2","text":"I could present another theory..."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Truly! The great serpent works in mysterious ways, but there can be no doubting that what happened here today was none other than a divine miracle!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Ally of Ronka or no, I will entertain no wild theories or speculation about what has happened here today. The great serpent has granted us a miracle, and we must show proper obeisance!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"If I might be so bold as to expand upon your insight, young Chaqurl, I believe I can identify precisely that miraculous object which the serpent did carry on his blessed pate."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Verily, this can be none other than that greatest blessing of Rak'tika─Ronkan moss, which grows so verdant and lush in our forest home!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"If I recall from my studies, Ronkan moss can be harvested from numerous sources, but in particular certain rocks found in the Husk, upon which it grows in great abundance."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"If I recall from my studies, Ronkan moss can be harvested from numerous sources, but in particular certain species of tree found in the Husk, upon which it grows in great abundance."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"If I recall from my studies, Ronkan moss can be harvested from numerous sources, but in particular from a species of turtle found in the Red Chalice, upon whose shell it grows in great abundance."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, ally of Ronka! You have my word that this is the last time I will impose upon you. Might you be so kind as to go forth in search of the moss that will save my people?"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Splendid! And I, young Chaqurl, will make for Fanow. The Viis will doubtless have insight to share on how to brew the moss into a proper elixir."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"I am deeply og-<span class=\"emphasis\">bliged</span> to you, my friends. I will tend to Father and pray that his condition has not worsened in the meantime. Until we meet again!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"The great serpent has spoken! The moss will heal Father and our friends once and for all─I am sure of it!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Does my encyclopedic knowledge of Ronkan flora surprise you? For it should not. Valan and I used to run about in the forest and collect rare shrubs and fronds since we were knee-high to a wood raider."},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"So the fourth stela has been found. Welcome tidings in these trying times, indeed. If there is aught we can do to aid our Qitari friends, you need but say the word."},{"name":"PHYNA","text":"Ronkan moss, you say? I fear that it does not grow in these parts. I pray that you find it, and find it swiftly─the fate of the forest depends upon it."},{"name":"CIUNA","text":"A type of moss that holds the power to heal the sick? I cannot help but wonder if this was one of the many wonders birthed by Ronkan mastery of the arcane."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Did you find the moss, friend? Oh, please say you did!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Splendid! Splen-<span class=\"emphasis\">fid</span>-erous! Why, it looks just as it did on the stela! We must prepare the medicine at once..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Following the method illustrated by the carvings on the fourth stela, the Stewards brewed an elixir from the Ronkan moss, and distributed it to their ailing friends. Before long, the symptoms eased, and a brighter mood returned to the Stopple."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"No longer lacking for manpower, Chaqurl Qhotl and his friends built a workshop where the medicine could be produced in large quantities to be distributed across the Greatwood."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Some time later..."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Ahem! Reports have it that our friends in Slitherbough and Fanow are well on their way to making a complete recovery. All of Rak'tika truly is in your debt, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I have no words to express my gratitude..."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"You have my <span class=\"emphasis\">grad</span>-atude as well, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! And we must not forget the great serpent, who guided us to the cure! Speaking of which...where did it go?"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"It is not our place to question the workings of the divine, my boy. No doubt it felt its role here was done, and returned to a place where only the gods know."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Does that mean─&lt;sniff&gt;─I'll never see it again?"},{"name":"TSUCHINOKO","text":"(-Great Serpent of Ronka-)Scree!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Did I hear what I think I heard!?"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"The serpent returns to us! Or...perhaps it was watching over us from behind the stela all along?"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Doubtless so, Chaqurl. Indeed...the great serpent truly does work in mysterious ways."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"And so it was that the Qitari reclaimed the history and knowledge of their forefathers, and in so doing, played their role in returning peace to the Greatwood─just as foreseen by a certain prognosticating priest. All was according to the great serpent's plan...or was it?"},{"name":"TSUCHINOKO","text":"Scree?"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I cannot thank you enough for all you have done on behalf of my boy─no, on behalf of all the Stewards."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"You will be pleased to know that we have succeeded in producing the mossy brew in large quantities. Any fears of a plague sweeping through the Greatwood are well behind us."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Did you ever find out what caused the disease, Father?"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"It is difficult to say for certain, but I do have a theory. Plants, blossoms, and trees abound in the Greatwood, all possessing their own seeds and spores─some of which can be quite poisonous."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Lesser poisons exist as well. In that case, one might build up an immunity if one lives for long enough in their presence. At the same time, different areas of the wood are home to different flora, each bearing their own poisons."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"And so, living for a hundred years far away from this place, you say we have a different...in-<span class=\"emphasis\">num</span>-ity than our friends in Slitherbough and Fanow?"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Precisely, my boy. More precisely, we carry an element of the poison within us, and it is this which protects us from their harmful effects."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"The downside of this, of course, is quite clear. When these poisons are carried to a new place, where others are not accustomed to them, the selfsame thing that protects us from their effects can have harmful effects on others─just as the poisons our own bodies are unaccustomed to can harm us."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"So, the sickness...it was all our fault for coming here?"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Perhaps...and perhaps not. We are not the only ones who traveled here when the path through the Ravel was opened. We Qitari, the creatures of the forest we saw on our way...doubtless the spread of the pox was inevitable."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"And besides, in coming here, we have rediscovered a powerful elixir fashioned by our forefathers─one that we might use to prevent any further outbreaks of disease among those who call the Greatwood home."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Looking back, I suspect that matters such as these were a source of great consternation in the days of the empire, when peoples moved about the Greatwood often and in droves."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"No doubt this is why it was the Ronkans who discovered the cure─with the guidance of their divine protector, of course."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"The same divine protector who remembers well the events of those days, and who led us back to the remedy it had shared with our forefathers so many years ago."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"The fourth stela has been reclaimed, and with it, another piece of our heritage. And yet, the Qitari did not do this alone..."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"You, ally of Ronka. Your friends Quinfort and Valan. Our loyal allies among the Viis. All played a part in making this day happen. Given our peoples' mutual histories, it is perhaps fitting─wouldn't you say, Chaqurl?"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"In-<span class=\"emphasis\">tube</span>-itably! At long last, I understand how people must have felt in the days of Ronka, when our peoples cooperated and lived together in a great <span class=\"emphasis\">cil</span>-ivization!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"The wisdom of our forefathers has saved us today.
