Only an audience with Tataramu will tell.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Ever dainty as a phial of nightshade and soft-spoken in the manner of someone accustomed to being listened to, Tataramu tells you that the only materials to be had are at the Gates of Judgement in Coerthas, where an Ishgardian trader awaits his sack of gil.","The Ishgardian trader has been met and paid, and you have had your fill of cryptic talk for the day. Think what a relief it would be to hand the materials to Norbettaux, and hear his easy chatter as he prepares the crafting facility for your use.","With his usual deftness, Norbettaux readies the crafting facility for you. With the materials you have obtained, synthesize three high-quality isolator components, and deliver them to Jezul Ahuatan at Ehcatl.<br><br>※In the event that the status <span class=\"highlight\">Facility Access: Detailing II</span> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Norbettaux.","Such is Jezul Ahuatan's relief at taking delivery of the isolator components that you are struck anew by the burden he bears as the Second of Ehcatl. In times of unrest, all must become adventurers─and trust in one another to acquire what is so urgently needed."],"objectives":["Speak with Tataramu.","Deliver the sack of gil to the Ishgardian trader at the Gates of Judgement.","Present the isolator component materials to Norbettaux at Camp Dragonhead.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize isolator components <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"></span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the isolator components <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Jezul Ahuatan the Second</span></span>."],"dialogue":[{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"One thing after another, always it is! So hard to find good products, why must it be? An urgent need of three replacement isolator components, I have. Squawkka-wak! Trust that favor-monger, I do not! But owe him this time, I must. Three more chits of mine, he will have, squawk!"},{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"Another way, there is not. Shake itself to pieces, the ceruleum propulsion engine will, without a frame made from quality parts. Go squawkka-wak, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Dezul Qualan</span> would, before the ground, it left!"},{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"Separate life and death, rubber dampers do. No dampers for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Dezul Qualan</span>'s engine, squawk? Burst every blood vessel in your feet, the vibrations would."},{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"Once, a ceruleum engine off its mount, I saw. Terrible sight, it was─rip-rip-rip through everything, it went. Held in place, the engine must be. The most important component, the mount is. Sqqquawk! Most important!"},{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"No material, there is. Material <span class=\"emphasis\">scare-city</span>, the featherless claim, squawk! Nothing by any other name, nothing, it is! Of quality material, these isolator components must be made. Or squawkka-wak, the result is, and much crumpling, there will be."},{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"No choice, I had. A humble request to Tataramu, I made. The materials for three components, he has found, in spite of the great...<span class=\"emphasis\">scare-city</span>. With you, he will speak."},{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"Say it thrice, I must? Urgent need of those isolator components, we have. Sqqquawk, the crafting skills, you already have. Found the material, that imp Tataramu has."},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"I'm sure Jezul has filled you in on my special...access? It took some doing, but I've located the material for your isolator components."},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"That is, of course, the good news. The bad news is that the location in question is Coerthas. I do hope you enjoy traveling. The mountains are quite beautiful this time of the year."},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"You have an appointment with a trader at the Gates of Judgement. No names, as he abhors the unnecessary exchange of information. Here is a sack of gil to pay him. Very exacting people, Ishgardians. Did you know they will drag a man to gaol over a single missing gil?"},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"But your sole concern is to secure the materials and craft those isolator components, I am sure. The crafting facility at Camp Dragonhead─do say hello to Norbettaux from me─is a much more pleasant destination than an Ishgardian scaffold, you'd agree."},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"Your material awaits in Coerthas, at the Gates of Judgement.

Take your material and have the joy of it─and should there be questions later, it comes not to me, understand? Ishgard has no liking for trade with outlanders..."},{"name":"ISHMERCHANT01523","text":"Even a trade with the great and wealthy Highwind Skyways. Not officially─but in the shadow of the Gates of Judgement, no man may judge another, for here, a man judges himself."},{"name":"ISHMERCHANT01523","text":"How do you judge yourself, Highwind's <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span>? For now, I will take my gil, you will take your material, and back we shall go to where our betters want us. But I think that you are one I would consent to meet again."},{"name":"ISHMERCHANT01523","text":"Take your material and go. We may meet again one day, but today, there are other duties each of us must attend to."},{"name":"NORBETTAUX","text":"I've had word of your coming from Master Tataramu─welcome to our humble crafting facility! Had a long journey? No rest for the crafty, I take it."},{"name":"NORBETTAUX","text":"Remarkable that you were able to secure materials in the midst of this shortage─but I wouldn't dream of prying into your affairs. I am only too happy that I can be of assistance..."},{"name":"NORBETTAUX","text":"The facility is fit for use─it does take a while to warm up. Here are your materials─not a single defect, of course. I'll hold the excess for safekeeping. Do let me know if you need anything else.

I am always here, it seems."},{"name":"NORBETTAUX","text":"All done with the crafting? Oh, that looks marvelous! I am sure your client─whoever he or she is─will be delighted! And of course, this crafting facility is ever ready to assist again should there be any problems with the components."},{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"A welcome sight, you are─squawk! Survive, you did, your brush with the Ishgardians? Brought me the components, you have?"},{"name":"JEZULAHUATAN","text":"Squee-squee... Well sourced, well made! Footprints in blood, I shall not see. Not on ceilings and not on floors... Trust the imp wholly, I do not. When say that, I do, trust me well. Trust you, though, I do. Good crafter you are, promises you keep.
