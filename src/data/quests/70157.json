Cascades of revelation, oceans of understanding! The risk of dependency looms, but the mind wants what it wants!"},{"name":"EAOMIA04621B","text":"...<span class=\"emphasis\">Ahem</span>. Do pardon my outburst─although we no longer possess the nervous systems of mortal meat sacks, one's consciousness still craves the occasional refreshment."},{"name":"EAOMIA04621B","text":"But to think that similar impulses once coursed throughout our systems at the slightest movement...
