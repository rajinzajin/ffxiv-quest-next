In which case..."},{"name":"BEVES","text":"Before the occupation I was a humble historian. While my duties leave me scarce time for aught else, I think it important that these momentous events be recorded for the benefit of future generations."},{"name":"BEVES","text":"Primary sources are indispensable, and I had a mind to question a number of my fellow freedom fighters─ask them their motivations for taking up this cause and so forth."},{"name":"BEVES","text":"You may take down their statements in this log. And...<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>...thank you for your service. Now and ever after."},{"name":"BEVES","text":"It matters not what their reasons are, only that they are honest and forthright. This is for posterity's sake, after all."},{"name":"HROTMAR","text":"Why'd I join the Resistance? Well, if you must know...it was to avenge a friend the imperials butchered before my very eyes, back in Ala Mhigo."},{"name":"HROTMAR","text":"We owned a stall in the markets, and a passing soldier snatched up a piece of fruit. He spoke out before I could stop him, only to get a fulm of steel in the gut for his troubles. I found my way here, and that was that."},{"name":"ORELLA","text":"Why? Why indeed... To save lives, perhaps. Or to make amends for the ones I couldn't."},{"name":"ORELLA","text":"My father and my brothers were worked to death while building a castrum. What did it matter to the Garleans, eh? More where that lot came from. After that, I couldn't keep on doing nothing."},{"name":"HUGHOC","text":"Hm? Aren't you the eikon-slayer? Damned if I know why you'd bother asking someone like me why I joined the Resistance, but it's simple: if I wasn't fighting for Ala Mhigo, I'd be fighting for the Empire."},{"name":"HUGHOC","text":"You're either with 'em or not, and if you're with 'em, you may as well make the most of it. Food, training, citizenship if you live long enough. You'll die stealing someone else's land, like as not, but that's the choice. But me? I'd rather die here."},{"name":"AHELISSA","text":"I was just a cook before all this. Simple fare, really. Had a chance to lend a hand and help feed some refugees one day..."},{"name":"AHELISSA","text":"I took a liking to the fighters. They...believed, you know? And there's always a need for cooks─or at least people who can work with whatever the foraging parties turn up..."},{"name":"BEVES","text":"Well met, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Have you spoken with the freedom fighters as I asked?"},{"name":"BEVES","text":"Hmm... As fascinating as they are varied... You have a knack for convincing others to bare their hearts to you. I could not have done better myself."},{"name":"BEVES","text":"Many years from now, when these tempestuous times pass into memory, their accounts will serve as a window into the struggle. We must never forget, my friend.
