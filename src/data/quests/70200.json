She asks that you summon G'raha Tia to the Eight Sentinels, that you may regale them both with tales of the enemies you fought and the experiments you unearthed.","As you relate your battle with the cloned Tiamat, Noah seems satisfied, revealing that the ultimate purpose of her request was to see that the contributions of Allag's researchers─namely, her pupils Unei and Doga─do not go ignored by future generations. With floor thirty of Eureka Orthos conquered, your obligation to the archmagus is fulfilled, but she informs you that the deeper floors house even more dangerous creatures to combat and more lustering treasure to uncover. Whether you set foot into those treacherous depths, however, is a decision entirely up to you."],"objectives":["Speak with Koh Rabntah."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"You are returned, and with no grievous wounds that I can discern! I take it that means you have proven equal to the task of plumbing Eureka Orthos's depths?"},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"I knew the contrivances of Allag's brightest minds would be no match for you! But of course, what else should I have expected from an adventurer of your caliber?"},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"I am very much looking forward to your full report, but first you should summon G'raha Tia. I did make the boy a promise, after all."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"If you would, impress upon him that the matter is one of the utmost urgency. Although I suspect he hardly needs the extra prodding."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Fascinating. It was as Noah said would happen─the vanguard of Allagan research came to meet your advance."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Artificial organisms and clones, each more fearsome than the last. And at the end of this vicious parade was none other than..."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"A clone of Tiamat, one of the first brood. "},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"When Xande began his conquest of the southern continent, the dragons which held dominion over the region offered fierce resistance."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Thus was every available resource poured into creating a species of wyrm which would bend to Allagan will. Once Tiamat and her kin were captured, they were used to hasten the subjugation of dragonkind."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"The many clones born from this research were also used as fodder for a different project, which aimed to perfect the means by which Bahamut could be used to power Dalamud."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"When we encountered Tiamat on Azys Lla, 'twas plain her thoughts had never strayed far from Bahamut, even after thousands of years of imprisonment."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"If her clone was forced to watch as he was reduced to a power source for that fell moon... Even if that Bahamut was merely a primal, the sight must have torn at her heart."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Is that compassion I hear in your voice? Toward Tiamat? My, how times have changed."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"I know not how the deeds carried out in Eureka Orthos will look when viewed through your eyes. I imagine they might not paint the empire in the most magnanimous of lights."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Yet as an Allagan myself, I can say that at the time, they were not only a symbol of our eminence, but also a means of our survival."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"...Perhaps you think we went too far?"},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Before rushing to judgment, allow me to remind you that civilization thrives by bending nature to its will. Allagan science is but one manifestation of this inevitability."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"None would bat an eye to see a river dammed to prevent flooding. We breed plants and animals with the intent to make their next generations hardier─for our own benefit, not for the subject's."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"I am interested to hear your opinion, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. What impression has Eureka Orthos left upon you?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"The Allagans were visionaries!"},{"name":"A1","text":"You're not wrong. But you aren't completely right, either."},{"name":"A1","text":"The Allagans crossed a line, then went far beyond it."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"You know, you never did say <span class=\"emphasis\">why</span> you wanted <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> to delve into the facility."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Was there some manner of impending catastrophe that you hoped to prevent by clearing the laboratory of threats?"},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Oh, 'twas nothing so noble as that. Naturally, with no researchers to maintain them, the remaining experiments would succumb to the march of time."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"I knew this would be my final chance to share them with another─to share what Allag's researchers wrought."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Their endless experimentation produced the answers to questions few thought to even ask. And now, in a way, their work shall live on."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"My time in Eureka Orthos was merely a diversion, but my pupils devoted heart and soul to their research, knowing that their fate─and the fate of their nation─depended on their success."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Your pupils were here?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I've heard that the archmagus guided the education of the imperial family."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"So when you speak of your pupils, that can only mean..."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Doga and Unei, yes. The direct descendants of Emperor Xande. They agreed to be cloned, that they might serve the empire forevermore."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"I wanted the world to know what their sacrifice gave us. How they spurred the advance of technology further than any before them."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"I thank you for going along with my selfish requests thus far. If you would allow me another indulgence, I would like to dedicate your expedition to the memory of those children and their fallen homeland."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Thank you, my friend! Now then, let us move on to lighter matters, yes? Eureka Orthos is not the sole repository of Allagan ingenuity."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"For the empire was vast, and they were loath to put all their eggs in one basket, so to speak. Doubtless other similar facilities dot the realm."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Should you stumble upon one during your adventures, do not hesitate to venture into its halls. Why, I daresay your most thrilling discoveries are yet ahead of you!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I look forward to hearing of them!"},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"Allow me to offer you my thanks once again, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Your efforts have seen a long-held wish of mine fulfilled at last."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"And while you have no more obligation to me, Eureka Orthos reaches deeper still into the earth."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"On the lowermost floors the most volatile experimentations were carried out. I cannot in good conscience suggest you delve further, but if riches and adventure are what you seek, I can think of no better place."},{"name":"KOHRABNTAH","text":"If you find aught of interest, I promise to share with you what I know of its history. That is, of course, assuming you survive the journey! Farewell and happy hunting, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!
