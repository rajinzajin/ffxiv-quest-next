Through choked sobs, she reveals that she was being held captive by the Corpse Brigade. Fearing that this incident may spur Wilred and the others to action, Gundobald bids you go to them and see that they do not do something they may later regret.","To your dismay, it would seem that Wilred and his friends have already set their plan in motion. Hurry back to Gundobald and show him the blunt hunting knife and the Zanr'ak map you have found.","It seems that Wilred and his friends have been plotting to summon Rhalgr. To this end, they seek to infiltrate an Amalj'aa stronghold and steal the beastmen's cache of crystals. Intercept Wilred and his conspirators to the east of Little Ala Mhigo before the unthinkable comes to pass.","Wilred's plan has come to naught, as have his hopes of reclaiming his homeland. Return to Little Ala Mhigo and speak with Gundobald.","Wilred reveals that it was the masked stranger who first prompted him and his friends to entertain the notion of summoning Rhalgr. But what did Lahabrea─if indeed it was he─hope to accomplish by putting great power in the hands of the unworthy?"],"objectives":["Ascertain the youths' intentions.","Deliver the clues to Gundobald.","Speak with Wilred.","Speak with Gundobald."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"Wilred mentioned obtaining the power to bring down the Empire.

Is it wrong to call ourselves Ala Mhigans?"},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"Do not heed such poisonous notions, child. Our dreams are what sustain us.

He was so angry..."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"I must tend to Bertliana. In the meantime, I need you to find out what the young ones make of this. I fear that they may do something rash."},{"name":"BERTLIANA","text":"...Don't worry about me.

Well, you're too late. Our plan is already in motion."},{"name":"WILRED","text":"Once we have the crystals, our enemies will pay for their crimes, and no one will dare oppress us ever again!"},{"name":"NPCA","text":"What those animals did to Bertliana is unforgivable! And to think <span class=\"emphasis\">they</span> look down on <span class=\"emphasis\">us</span>!"},{"name":"NPCA","text":"Well, I'll suffer this humiliation no more! I'm with Wilred to the bitter end! I'm not afraid of a few lizards!"},{"name":"NPCB","text":"If this plan succeeds, we'll have the power to lay the Empire low! To change the world for the better!"},{"name":"NPCB","text":"Might be as Gundobald's content to eke out an existence in this musty old cave, but I'll be damned if I'm going to spend the rest of my life here.

A hunting knife...and a map of Zanr'ak? ...Wait. You said Wilred spoke of crystals, did you not? But they couldn't possibly mean to─ By the gods, this is rank madness..."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"The young fools are untrained and unblooded, all. They have no notion of how dangerous the Amalj'aa are. They'll be butchered before they get within a hundred yalms of the crystals."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"They are headed east.

We never saw him again."},{"name":"WILRED","text":"I wanted so desperately to believe that we could raise ourselves from this squalor that I never stopped to question his motives. But I should have known─there's no solution, nothing we can do to change our lot. Our people are doomed to live and die like beasts..."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"Listen to me, Wilred. Our home may be lost to us, but it takes more than stones and mortar to define who we are. No matter where we may be, Ala Mhigo lives on within us all."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"It is for you to decide what to make of this legacy.

I promise."},{"name":"WILRED","text":"Thank you for saving me. And...sorry I tried to kill you."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"My thanks as well, friend.
