He is hiding from someone at Alder Springs, and asks urgently for your assistance. It is clear that, as was the case with Da Za, this is the work of the Defiant. Travel to Alder Springs and stop them before anything happens to Dozol Meloc. Lalai will inform Zhai'a Nelhah of the letter.","You find Dozol Meloc surrounded by Defiant mages ready to attack. You intervene and they soon fall to your dark magicks. Assist the Ixali mage and confirm that he is unharmed.","You have successfully defended Dozol Meloc from the Defiant mages. As he is thanking you for your help, Zhai'a Nelhah arrives. He once again berates you for slaying every last attacker─again leaving not one alive to be questioned─before realizing that they appear to have been burned alive <span class=\"emphasis\">from the inside</span>. Dozol Meloc suggests that, without the Gem of Shatotto to control their dark magicks, the very aether within their bodies ignited when they resorted to their most powerful spells. Zhai'a Nelhah offers his apologies for blaming you for the previous deaths before leaving. Dozol Meloc is safe and the Defiant mages have been defeated. Return to Ul'dah and report to Lalai.","You tell Lalai what happened. She points out that the Defiant's inability to utilize their powers without dying horrible, fiery deaths probably hinders their ability to recruit new members. This explains the desperation with which they approached your beastman allies. Although you have no information to assist in locating Waldeve and his cult, they are in no position to stay in hiding. Frantic for answers, they will soon be forced to reveal themselves. You need simply wait for that moment.<br><br>※The next black mage quest will be available from Lalai upon reaching level 58."],"objectives":["Search Alder Springs for Dozol Meloc.","Aid Dozol Meloc.","Report to Lalai."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LALAI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!

The handwriting is barely legible."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"It doubtless goes without saying, but Dozol Meloc is in need of our help."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"I shall have to tell Zhai'a Nelhah about this. Do not dwell on his previous outburst. I know you have full control of your powers."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Use this opportunity to show that man the true cunning and finesse that a black mage can bring to the fight!"},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Enough talk. Hurry to Alder Springs and save Dozol Meloc!"},{"name":"LALAI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, why are you still here!? Dozol Meloc is clearly in danger! Hurry to Alder Springs and save him!"},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Save Dozol's life, you have! Kazagg Chah tried to warn Dozol. Dozol panicked, tried to flee. But get caught, Dozol did! Squaaawk!"},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"Somehow knew that Dozol was exiled from tribe, these mages did. So into the forest, they chased Dozol! Squaaawk!"},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"Finally, they surrounded Dozol. Offered friendship at first...but rejected, Dozol did. They said if Dozol is not friend, then Dozol enemy... But save Dozol, you did. Many thanks."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Gods! I was too late <span class=\"emphasis\">again</span>! You've already cut your swath of reckless destruction."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"What did you plan to achieve? How many more lives must you end before you realize how fruitless this is?"},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Wait... These wounds...they're unlike anything I've ever seen. It looks like they were incinerated from the <span class=\"emphasis\">inside</span>."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, was this perhaps not your doing, after all?"},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"Of what does this man speak? Pursued Dozol for a long time, these men did. Tried to kill Dozol! Squaaawk! Explain! Who are they? What did they want!?"},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"Dozol understands now! Squaaawk! Read the Book of Thal, they did. Learned of mother of mother of mother of Dozol, learned of her secrets─Dozol's secrets. Made clear, their pursuit is!"},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"But these wounds... Perhaps Dozol has an explanation. These men did not have the Gem of Shatotto! Squaaawk! Dozol thinks that is why they died."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"Gem of Shatotto? Whatever are you talking about?"},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"Gem is proof that <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> is <span class=\"emphasis\">true</span> black mage."},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"Gem brims with magical power. Without the Gem of Shatotto, impossible to control, the most powerful black magic is! Squaaawk!"},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"Lost control, these mages did. Aether within their own bodies ignited! Burned alive from the inside. Painful way to die, it is."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"So these Defiant mages fell victim to their own arrogance─using dark magicks that far outstripped their ability to control them. So <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> isn't at fault..."},{"name":"DOZOLMELOC","text":"The answers you seek, Dozol hopes you find. But Dozol cannot stay here. Dozol must leave. Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Dozol owes you debt of life. Squaaawk! One day, Dozol will repay!"},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"So these men were slain not by your hand, but by their own use of powers they couldn't control."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"But please understand that the fact that <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> can control your powers does nothing to resolve the issue at hand."},{"name":"ZHAIANELHAH","text":"You should return to Lalai and explain to her what happened here. Please accept my apologies for my earlier accusations."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Was Dozol Meloc unharmed?"},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Hmmm, I see... Well, if nothing else, it seems that Zhai'a Nelhah no longer doubts your innocence."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"But...the Defiant were immolated from within? If Dozol Meloc's conjecture is accurate, the cult's situation becomes quite clear! But I hardly need to explain that to <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>, do I?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"How will you answer?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Ah, so you have noticed, too."},{"name":"A1","text":"But if you <span class=\"emphasis\">were</span> to explain it to me...?"},{"name":"LALAI","text":"But I still cannot condone Zhai'a Nelhah's attitude. I have struggled ceaselessly through my studies of the dark arts myself with what little power I have. Perhaps none can understand the Defiant's motivations better than I..."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"I suppose for one to whom these powers come as second nature, some things are not so easily noticed."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"The Defiant's numbers cannot continue to grow indefinitely. They will have difficulty swelling their ranks when they cannot use their powers without the risk of a horrifying death by immolation."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Thus they strive for control over the dark arts, while showing themselves only to our beastman friends in the hope that they might reveal the secrets to controlling these magicks."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Fortunately, we have prevented them from learning anything. With these avenues now lost to him, Waldeve must realize that he is running out of options."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"Though we may lack leads from which to track down the Defiant, their position becomes weaker the longer they wait. They will soon be forced to take action."},{"name":"LALAI","text":"There is no need to rush─we need simply wait the enemy out."}],"reward":{"gil":1524,"xp":72000},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":56,"id":26}],"quests":[67216]},"next":[67218]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006752","obj":{"i":1006752,"n":"Lalai","l":41,"q":16}},{"type":"npc","id":"1013055","obj":{"i":1013055,"n":"Dozol Meloc","l":57,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67216","obj":{"i":67216,"n":"A Cunning Plan","g":154,"l":"Ul'dah","s":540,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67218","obj":{"i":67218,"n":"Destruction in the Name of Justice","g":154,"l":"Ul'dah","s":580,"f":1}}]}
