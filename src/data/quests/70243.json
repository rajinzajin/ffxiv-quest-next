I daresay some deft management is in order. "},{"name":"MANAGINGWAY","text":"As managing is what I do best, I would have you to coordinate with Ridingway yonder, and revitalize our weary comrades with the best cure for a pair of drooping ears: music."},{"name":"RIDINGWAY","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Here to get a bounce back in some of our Ways' hop, eh?"},{"name":"RIDINGWAY","text":"Well, nothing brings it out like music. Once they hear some merry melodies, the thought of exhaustion will be the furthest thing from their minds as the uncontrollable urge to move takes over."},{"name":"RIDINGWAY","text":"But don't let me keep you here with all this talk─you ought to get hopping! Board the moon-hopper here, and perform the hop-step when you come across any exhausted Ways. We're counting on you!"},{"name":"RIDINGWAY","text":"Seems the moon-hopper returned with some unexecuted protocols. Sorry for the trouble, but I'd appreciate it if you could hop back out there and continue to revitalize any exhausted Ways you find with the hop-step."},{"name":"LOPORRIT04707A","text":"&lt;yawn&gt; Oh, what I wouldn't do to curl up somewhere for a nice long nap. But the items for the shopping center...I must make more..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Speak with Ridingway in Hoper's Hold to mount the moon-hopper, then perform the hop-step in the midst of exhausted Loporrits."},{"name":"LOPORRIT04707A","text":"Wh-What thrilling music! I thought I couldn't move another step, but now I could skip to my hibernation chamber! Once I've had a few winks, I'll get back to making items!"},{"name":"LOPORRIT04707B","text":"&lt;yawn&gt; I-I can't remember the last time I slept... I've been working on new inventions day in and day out without even so much as a...as a... I don't even know. Ugh, curse my admiration for Inventingway and my sycophantic desire to be recognized!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Speak with Ridingway in Hoper's Hold to mount the moon-hopper, then perform the hop-step in the midst of exhausted Loporrits."},{"name":"LOPORRIT04707B","text":"My, what a comforting melody! Just by hearing it I feel as though the panic that constantly hounds me may subside for even a moment─and look! Even my paws have begun to shake less violently!"},{"name":"LOPORRIT04707B","text":"You have my thanks. I never knew music could do such wonderful things, but now that I do, I shan't be wasting any more time with this “sleep” business. I have inventions to build! A boss to curry favor with! Failure to live in fear of! "},{"name":"LOPORRIT04707C","text":"I cannot move an ilm. An ilm, I tell you! I've been cooking up meals as the orders come at the cooking station, but they never, ever, <span class=\"emphasis\">stop</span> coming in!

I feel hope again! I feel alive! I could cook a hundred hundred more meals! Thank you for playing it. I was so weary I nearly forgot the joy I found in cooking. It is my dream, and as hard as it may be at times, it does truly bring me joy. I will continue to do my best! "},{"name":"MANAGINGWAY","text":"You are returned! Tell me, how did our exhausted Ways feel after hearing the music you played for them?"},{"name":"MANAGINGWAY","text":"Superb! Thanks to you and the wonders of music, my fellows were able to regain a bit of their lost vigor. It truly puts the power of melodies in a new light."},{"name":"MANAGINGWAY","text":"Management takes many forms, and caring for one's health is but one of them. Alas, it would seem some of our Ways have yet to grasp the concept, and so I do fear I shall be calling upon your help again in the near future."}],"reward":{"gil":735,"reputation":60,"items":[{"id":38952}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":5,"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":33}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1044403","obj":{"i":1044403,"n":"Managingway","l":3711,"q":28}},{"type":"item","id":"38952","obj":{"i":38952,"n":"Loporrit Carat","l":1,"c":"t/65100","t":100}}]}
