Our wares are known far and wide. Trade with the Namazu and Qestir has been especially profitable."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"But even as we enjoy new relations, we do not forget the old. The people of Isari traded with us when no one else would, and we continue to trade with them to this day."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"And today, there are some items that want for collection at the village─their payment for goods we provided them with earlier. Our merchants have been very busy, and struggle to find time to make regular visits there."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"The items in question were still being prepared when last we visited, but they should be ready by now. Let me see─dried fish, a wooden bucket, and a fish basket. Will you visit the village in our stead?"},{"name":"ISARIOLDMAN02993","text":"You're here from Tamamizu, you say? I've got these dried fish for you to take back."},{"name":"ISARIOLDMAN02993","text":"Our Kojin friends always request this. As I hear it, they don't have the right conditions where they live to make sun-dried goods themselves."},{"name":"ISARIOLDMAN02993","text":"There are two things we have plenty of around here: fish and sunshine. All I do is put the two together. Well, that and the fishing part beforehand. Speaking of which, I'd best get back to it. Bye now!"},{"name":"ISARIWOMAN02993","text":"The Tamamizu traders sent you, did they? They brought us some lovely coral the other day, but the bucket we promised them wasn't ready then. It's finished now though!"},{"name":"ISARIWOMAN02993","text":"My poor old Da was bedridden, and couldn't work for a while. But those Blue Kojin, good folk through and through, didn't mind the delay one bit."},{"name":"ISARIWOMAN02993","text":"Brought a tear to my eye, it did... Anyway, Da got it done as soon as he was out of bed. Give them our thanks!"},{"name":"ISARIMAN02993","text":"What's that? A fish basket for who? ...Ahhh, the Kojin! That's right, I was supposed to give them one!"},{"name":"ISARIMAN02993","text":"With the Empire buggering off and leaving us to our waters, demand for fishing gear is higher than ever! I'd run out of baskets just before the traders came to collect theirs."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"Were you able to collect the goods?"},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"Yes, these will do nicely. You may notice that none of these things are worth much. So why do we trade for these wares? The reason is simple."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"Isari suffered a great deal under the Empire, with fishing and trade heavily restricted. This is our way of helping, by asking only that which they can afford to give. We shall continue to support them, as they support us."}],"reward":{"gil":550,"reputation":60,"items":[{"num":15,"id":28},{"id":21081}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":5,"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":34}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1024217","obj":{"i":1024217,"n":"Zukin","l":2409,"q":24}},{"type":"npc","id":"1024310","obj":{"i":1024310,"n":"Isari Fisherman","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1024311","obj":{"i":1024311,"n":"Isari Fisherman","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1024312","obj":{"i":1024312,"n":"Isari Cooper's Daughter","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1024313","obj":{"i":1024313,"n":"Isari Cooper's Daughter","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1024314","obj":{"i":1024314,"n":"Isari Basket Weaver","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1024315","obj":{"i":1024315,"n":"Isari Basket Weaver","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"28","obj":{"i":28,"n":"Allagan Tomestone of Poetics","l":1,"c":65023,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"21081","obj":{"i":21081,"n":"Kojin Sango","l":1,"c":65058,"t":100}}]}
