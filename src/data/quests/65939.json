Visit the Brewer's Beacon and discover what has befallen Khanswys, the lighthouse keeper.","Locate the scarecrow in the middle of the dodo nesting grounds known as “the Flock,” and set the iron brazier down on the ground nearby.","Light a fire in the brazier to attract the attention of the runaway bomb. Defeat the torchlight and obtain a bomb claw from its remains.","You have obtained the bomb claw Khanswys needs to fuel her furnace. Return to the Brewer's Beacon and deliver the smoldering digit to the lighthouse keeper.","Though the bomb claw is able to power the lighthouse beacon for the time being, Khanswys is dubious about the quality of her makeshift repairs. Return to Swiftperch and report the situation to Fraeloef.","Fraeloef intends to file reports regarding the incident at the lighthouse, but is concerned about the fragile state of the furnace. The Yellowjacket requests that you make haste to the Armorers' Guild and ask Forgemaster H'naanza to oversee the necessary repairs.","After hearing your request, Forgemaster H'naanza agrees to have the faulty furnace repaired. The armorer mentions, with some irritation, that the furnace was only just recently fixed. It seems that the bomb trapped inside may have been overly volatile, but could there be another reason for the device's failure...?"],"objectives":["Speak with Khanswys.","Set the iron brazier on the ground near the scarecrow.","Light the brazier, and obtain a bomb claw from the torchlight that is drawn in by the flames.","Deliver the bomb claw to Khanswys.","Return to Swiftperch and report to Fraeloef.","Speak with Forgemaster H'naanza in Limsa Lominsa."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To accept this quest, you must abandon the current main scenario quest.

I would march over to the lighthouse and investigate myself, but I am duty-bound to remain at my post."},{"name":"FRAELOEF","text":"I would consider it a favor if you could make a visit to the Brewer's Beacon and see if aught has befallen Khanswys, the lighthouse keeper."},{"name":"KHANSWYS","text":"Ye say a Yellowjacket sent ye here?
