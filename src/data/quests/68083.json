In the heat of battle, it's either you or them, but after...when you've had time to think about what you've done..."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"I am told one of your comrades was injured during the operation. If there is aught we can do to help, pray do not hesitate to ask."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I've been thinking. If Alisaie needs more time to heal, maybe we should move her to Rhalgr's Reach."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"She can receive much better care there, after all. Our infirmary is probably the best place for her, short of sending her to Gridania."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Indeed. And given what Mistress Woad has told us, I would rather she did not remain here."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Then it's settled. Naago, go and see about getting us a carriage and an escort. Alphinaud, you should get your sister ready for the journey."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, would you mind going on ahead and telling Orella that we're on our way? I want a bed waiting for Alisaie when she arrives. Thanks."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"They'll learn what it means to live free. We'll teach them. Together."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Must seem strange seeing me doling out orders. But not half as strange as it feels to do it, let me tell you."},{"name":"ORELLA","text":"Hm? Do you require assistance?"},{"name":"ORELLA","text":"Very well, we will make ready to receive the patient at once. Give me a hand, would you?"},{"name":"ORELLA","text":"There. All crisp and freshly laundered."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We're here. Is everything in order?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Right. We're bringing her in."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Honestly, Alphinaud, you needn't have gone to all this trouble..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"What can I say? It seemed a good way to discourage you from limping off to battle when my back was turned. Listen to Orella, please. You need your rest."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I know, I know...<br>Any news of Krile? She'll be cross if you make her wait too long. As will I."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Hah. A chilling prospect indeed... I'll find her, Sister. And I'll fight twice as hard─for the both of us."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"They're good together...when they're not at each other's throats. I miss that feeling..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─I have a favor to ask. Would you mind waiting outside for me? I won't be a moment."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We'll find Krile and bring her home. After all, I need her to tell you to stay in bed."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I should have been there with you to the end. If only I hadn't been so reckless..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; Maybe we got a little carried away... But you have to admit that was fun."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.
