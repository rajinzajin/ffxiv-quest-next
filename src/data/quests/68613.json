Knowing what Allagan horrors once roamed its confines, they dare not investigate alone. To that end, Philiot was sent to request your assistance. You consent, and he readies himself for a long journey to Azys Lla.","You arrive at Azys Lla to find Philiot consulting with himself about one of the teleporters at Matter Conduit VI–VII. From what you can hear of his conversation, an intruder in the Fractal Continuum has triggered its anti-intruder systems, ruling out entrance via teleportation. The thought of piloting the <span class=\"emphasis\">Enterprise</span> to get inside terrifies Philiot. Thankfully, he will be accompanied by the Warrior of Light. With you at his side, he musters up the courage to board the airship and embark on a journey to the depths of the Allagans' great technological museum.","The Fractal Continuum was plagued with all manner of chimerical horrors, and even prototypes for one of the Allagans' most dreaded creations─the Ultima Weapon. Much to Philiot's relief, your surpassing strength proved the reason for their inferiority. With the source of the strange signal decommissioned, he suggests returning to Matter Conduit VI–VII to confirm the teleporters are once again operational.","The teleporters are fully functional, but there still remains the matter of the intruder who first locked them. You spy an Ixal in the distance with his head hung low whom Philiot presumes was the cause for your troubles. Considering the difficulty of reaching Azys Lla via an ordinary airship, he surmises the Ehcatl Nine are the only Ixal with the technological know-how to have made the voyage. He wishes to have a word with them for fear of another incident in the Fractal Continuum.","You arrive in the Black Shroud to find Kezul, the Ixal who ventured to Azys Lla, being scolded by the leader of the Ehcatl Nine, Sezul. Though he is furious at Kezul for stealing their airship, Sezul calms himself to ask why he would risk his life to return there. The answer is alarming. Among the chimerical monstrosities lining the walls of the Fractal Continuum, Kezul came across a creature that bears a striking resemblance to the Ixal. He soon came to the startling realization that they are a failed experiment of the Allagans, and the Ayatlan they yearned to return to is nothing more than a test tube. Sezul cares not for this revelation, reminding Kezul the dreams of the Ehcatl Nine were born from no one but themselves. They agree to keep this truth hidden from the others, and continue to search for a place the Ixal can call paradise.","Philiot is moved by the strength of Sezul's conviction. His resolve to continue pursuing a paradise for the Ixal has motivated Philiot to pursue his aspirations of becoming an engineer worthy of Garlond Ironworks.

Time to take a look at this here teleporter..."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"What in blazes? “Access Restricted”?<br>...This isn't good. Someone's already triggered the intruder defense system."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"The only way in now would be aboard an airship.

As you might've overheard a moment ago, the teleporter's been locked. Seems someone beat us here and activated the defense systems."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"It's nothing the <span class=\"emphasis\">Enterprise</span> can't handle, though. Once we've locked on to the signal, we can fly straight to its source in the blink of an eye.

On second thought, I'd rather not know the answer to that."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"I presume he was the one who woke the bloody things up. I tried talking to him, but only got sullen silence for my troubles."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"On the bright side, the teleporter should be functional now. That's assuming, of course, there's no one else lurking about."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"Well, would you look at that. Up and operational."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"But how do you think that Ixal reached Azys Lla in the first place? There's no way their balloons can reach these altitudes."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"...Unless the rumors are true. They say a group of Ixal in the North Shroud calling themselves the Ehcatl Nine has been working on some sort of hybrid airship."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"How's about we go and pay them a visit, eh? The last thing we need is for one of them to come back here and wake up another of the Allagans' <span class=\"emphasis\">delightful</span> toys."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"There you are. Well, come on then. Let's go and have a word with the Ixal."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"Seems I was right.

Why would you go back?"},{"name":"KEZULITZCAN","text":"Lined with tubes, the walls were. Filled with all manner of chimerical creations."},{"name":"KEZULITZCAN","text":"In the last of the chambers a terrible sight, I saw. It...it looked like us, Sezul. Named Iksalion, it was."},{"name":"KEZULITZCAN","text":"To serve the Allagans, they were made. Developed for an airborne division. Obey any order, they will."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"That sounds an awful lot like you Ixal, doesn't it? They say the Windrisen up in Coerthas follow their superior's commands with frightening obedience. Little wonder why you all left to make your own tribe."},{"name":"KEZULITZCAN","text":"Much the same, it sounds. But end there, the similarities do not. Weak to the elements, the Iksalion were. And riddled with genetic instabilities."},{"name":"KEZULITZCAN","text":"Does that not strike you as familiar? Unfit for the forests. Unfit to fly... An abomination, we are! A failed experiment of the Allagans. If Ayatlan exists, in a test tube, it lies."},{"name":"SEZULTOTOLOC","text":"Squawk, squawk! Silence!"},{"name":"SEZULTOTOLOC","text":"If Ayatlan is the damnable laboratory of Allagans, then seek paradise elsewhere, we must."},{"name":"SEZULTOTOLOC","text":"My desire to fly, to find our home in the sky─created by science, these are not."},{"name":"SEZULTOTOLOC","text":"Can we not aspire to greatness!? After all, made to dream, we were not."},{"name":"SEZULTOTOLOC","text":"Speak of this again, you will not. Understand? None will deny the Ixal's ambitions. Not even you!"},{"name":"KEZULITZCAN","text":"Forgive me, I...I was wrong. Our paradise. Ayatlan. Find it in Azys Lla, I did not. But someday I will, together with the Ehcatl Nine!"},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"Well, it looks like you've already resolved the matter we came to discuss. You won't be returning to Azys Lla, I take it?"},{"name":"KEZULITZCAN","text":"Never. Even at the threat of death, return there, we will not."},{"name":"SEZULTOTOLOC","text":"Squawk! Enough talking, Kezu. Prepare yourself. For stealing our airship, a most severe punishment, you will receive."},{"name":"KEZULITZCAN","text":"Squawk!? But...but Sezul!"},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"Everything's settled then, eh? And who would've thought the Ixal actually came from Azys Lla? I'd have lost all my feathers after hearing news like that."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"But they've chosen to keep a stiff upper lip...or beak, I suppose. And here I am being hard on myself for my upbringing in the Brume. Piss all compared to their hardships."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"If they won't give up on their dreams, then I won't on mine."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"Looks like I've got my work cut out for me if I'm to be even half the engineer Cid is."},{"name":"PHILIOT","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.
