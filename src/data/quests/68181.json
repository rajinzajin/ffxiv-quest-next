One such problem facing us right now concerns the local water supply."},{"name":"ANSGER","text":"Quarrying requires huge amounts of water─which becomes awfully dirty in the process. Should this water find its way into the reservoir next to the village, we'd lose our only source of clean drinking water."},{"name":"ANSGER","text":"Although, if we had an anila core or two─make that three─we could easily purify the water."},{"name":"ANSGER","text":"I'd like you to slay three dust anilas and bring back their cores.
