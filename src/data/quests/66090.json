Aye, I can tell by the lightness of your steps and the strength in your fists. I reckon you're ready for your next lesson."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"But before we begin, some warming up's in order. For this, I've scattered some gil across Ul'dah. I want you to run around the city and pick it all up."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Now, that's my money lying out there, so I want you to go about it like there's an Amalj'aa war band on your heels. In other words, I want you to <span class=\"emphasis\">sprint</span>."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Of course, you can't go on sprinting indefinitely─your body needs to rest awhile after each burst of speed. This may sound elementary, but I'm telling you this to demonstrate a point."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"As a pugilist, it's essential that you learn to pace yourself in a fight, else you're liable to get worn out.
