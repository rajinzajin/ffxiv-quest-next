Experienced with weapons, are you? What about the explosive kind?"},{"name":"DOB","text":"I've a friend who's uncovered a cache of imperial grenades, but neither of us has the slightest idea of how to use them. And you need to know your merchandise if you mean to get the best price."},{"name":"DOB","text":"My acquaintance is over at Specula Imperatoris right this moment, <span class=\"emphasis\">experimenting</span> with the ordnance. I beg you, please go and give him a hand before he loses both of his..."},{"name":"DOB","text":"My friend is still at Specula Imperatoris if you've a mind to look over those weapons for us. But pray make it quick─he can be a bit impetuous..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"An ordinary wooden crate."},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Oh, hello there! Dob sent an expert to have a look at my grenades, did he? I was about to start lobbing them at those crates there, but it might be best if you showed me how it's done."},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Says here on the case that these are the “Mark XLII” model...whatever that might mean. Naught for it but to try them out, eh? I'll wager you could blow up several crates at once if you threw one just right!"},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Come on! Let's see how the grenades fare against those crates! We need an idea of how wide─and how potent─the blast is."},{"name":"DOB","text":"You found my friend, did you? All in one piece? Good, good. Show him how to use those grenades properly, and we'll try to keep it that way."},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Rhalgr's righteous wrath, that was impressive! In fact, these imperial beauties might be powerful enough to blow a few other things to pieces..."},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Come with me to the backside of the base─I have something else I want you to test the grenades on!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The immobile remains of a warmachina."},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Do you see those warmachina? They're too broken for battle, but the individual pieces will fetch a decent purse on the right market. The only problem is, the things are still too damn sturdy to take apart without special tools."},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Well, I'd say a grenade counts as a “special tool.” Here, have a new case─let's see some warmachina bits fly!"},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"These Mark XLII grenades are pretty potent! Let's see if they do the job!"},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Nicely done! Now I've learned proper grenade usage <span class=\"emphasis\">and</span> we have a pile of parts to sell. Two birds with one explosion!"},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Aye, both the weapons and the warmachina pieces should earn us a tidy sum...assuming we can find a discerning customer."},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Speaking of which, I'd best take back any grenades you didn't throw. Where <span class=\"emphasis\">did</span> you learn how to use imperial weaponry anyway?"},{"name":"FOLLOWER02853","text":"Head back to Dob, and he'll reward you for sharing your expertise. Thanks again!"},{"name":"DOB","text":"My friend stopped by and told me how the tests went, so I thank you for keeping him safe. I'm not entirely comfortable around imperial ordnance, to be honest..."},{"name":"DOB","text":"We spent years slaving in a castrum workshop, loading powder into cannon shells and the like. It felt as if every bullet I filled was another countryman I helped kill."},{"name":"DOB","text":"The guilt grew so strong that I almost cast myself off a cliff. But my fear of death was the stronger─like a coward, I chose moldy heels of bread over the lives of my fellows."},{"name":"DOB","text":"In the end, I decided that I'd spite the Empire by living out my wretched life, and profit off the very same weapons I helped build. I'll be a damn weed, thriving on the rocky slopes of Gyr Abania..."}],"reward":{"gil":988,"items":[{"id":18723,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18724,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5678,"one":1}],"xp":116100},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":34}],"quests":[68079]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1021580","obj":{"i":1021580,"n":"Dob","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022960","obj":{"i":1022960,"n":"Manic Hyuran Man","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022961","obj":{"i":1022961,"n":"Warmachina Wreckage","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022962","obj":{"i":1022962,"n":"Warmachina Wreckage","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022963","obj":{"i":1022963,"n":"Warmachina Wreckage","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023067","obj":{"i":1023067,"n":"Warmachina Wreckage","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023068","obj":{"i":1023068,"n":"Warmachina Wreckage","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023069","obj":{"i":1023069,"n":"Warmachina Wreckage","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023141","obj":{"i":1023141,"n":"Manic Hyuran Man","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"18723","obj":{"i":18723,"n":"Palladium Choker of Healing","l":285,"c":54962,"t":40,"p":16485}},{"type":"item","id":"18724","obj":{"i":18724,"n":"Palladium Choker of Casting","l":285,"c":54962,"t":40,"p":16485}},{"type":"item","id":"5678","obj":{"i":5678,"n":"Savage Might Materia V","l":160,"c":20258,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Determination","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68079","obj":{"i":68079,"n":"Where Courage Endures","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1030}}]}
