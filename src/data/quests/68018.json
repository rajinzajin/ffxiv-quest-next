Alone you will deal with the Kojin."},{"name":"RASHO","text":"If you are set upon this course, I shall give to you a word of advice."},{"name":"RASHO","text":"Two factions have the Kojin. The mercenaries who serve the Empire belong to the Red."},{"name":"RASHO","text":"Those who belong to the Blue are the traders. They have made no pact with the imperials, and so may be willing to aid your cause."},{"name":"RASHO","text":"Seek the Blue on the Isle of Bekko. There you will find a cave.

If anything, I'm frustrated that I didn't think of it first..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Yda and my father had a way with words. They knew how to inspire people─how to bring them together. I always hoped I might have something of that in me too, but I'm starting to think I don't."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"What am I even doing here...?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...Lyse, you─"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Gods, listen to me! I don't know where that came from. Forget I said anything!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We have places to go, imperials to fight, and friends to save! And we're not going to get any of it done by standing around here moaning, right?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"...Right?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...Before we first traveled to Gyr Abania, I was in Limsa Lominsa, visiting...visiting a friend. A young child who had been through a great deal."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...That's neither here nor there, I suppose. Anyway, on the way back, I passed a patisserie which sold some of the most exquisite-looking tarts I had ever seen. I've always preferred cookies, to be honest, but nevertheless I decided to stop and try one..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...I'll treat you to one, when all this is over. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> too─and I won't take no for an answer."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"What about Y'shtola?

We should search further inland."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"How much further do you think it is?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Of course! Soroban said he was a Kojin of the Blue, didn't he?"},{"name":"SOROBAN","text":"Pleased though I am to see you again, I am confused. Were you not bound for Othard?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"How fortunate that we should find a familiar face in this place..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We should tell Soroban about our situation.
