But since you are here, perhaps you can offer us aid?"},{"name":"KEWSHSOOAN","text":"A ssspearfisher of ours has been away for some time. Too long by half. I fear he may be ssstruggling in this newly waterless world of ours. You, however, thrive in such environments. If he is injured or worse, then I should be grateful if you would go and render aid."},{"name":"KEWSHSOOAN","text":"Forgive me this sudden request, but I must ask that you search for him north of the Norvrandt Slope."},{"name":"KEWSHSOOAN","text":"The ssspearfisher I worry for has yet to return.

Where did you come from, finless one?"},{"name":"ONDOFISHER03578","text":"Kewshs Ooan sent you? Ah, how embarrassing... I am present and accounted for, as you can well see. However, the foodstuffs I had procured are not. A wily miscreant sssnatched them from my grasp not long before you arrived."},{"name":"ONDOFISHER03578","text":"I speak of those Ondo who refuse to treat with outsiders.

My thanks to you, finless one."},{"name":"ONDOFISHER03578","text":"I cannot return to the Cups without sssufficient game.

What has become of him?"},{"name":"KEWSHSOOAN","text":"Waylaid by thieves? That is unfortunate. But I am glad to hear he is unharmed, and that he managed to retain a portion of his catch."},{"name":"KEWSHSOOAN","text":"Do not mistake our misguided brethren for black-hearted villains. They but struggle to sssurvive in our changing realm, and I remain hopeful that one day they may see the error of their ways."},{"name":"KEWSHSOOAN","text":"We have all lost much in the wake of the Flood. Ondo and finless ones both. Yet we dare not let our loss define us or lead us unto wicked ways."},{"name":"KEWSHSOOAN","text":"You too have overcome much hardship in your life, have you not?
