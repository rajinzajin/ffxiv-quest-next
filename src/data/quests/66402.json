Show it to the goldsmith.","The work is more hands-on than you were led to expect. Pour the salamander oil on Godbert, and remember that generosity is a virtue.","Fortunately, you still have plenty of salamander oil. Unfortunately, there is still plenty more of Godbert in need of oiling. Keep pouring it onto the weary goldsmith.","You may as well finish what you started. Knead the oil into Godbert's weary flesh. This too is a virtue, though one less well defined.","Your work is far from over.
