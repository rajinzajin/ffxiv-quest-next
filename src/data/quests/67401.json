He sends the other two moogles on their respective patrols, and bids you find the errant Mogleo before he falls victim to a dragon attack.","You find Mogleo lying atop a broken piece of the ruins, apparently wounded in a fight with one of the dragons in the surrounding area. His wounds do not appear to be severe, but he worries for the safety of the others and begs you to inform Mogkul that Zenith has been overrun.","You arrive to find Mogkul breathing heavily over the fallen corpses of two dragons at his feet. He is dismayed and surprised that so many of Nidhogg's brood have infested Zenith, and is overcome with worry about the two moogles he sent on patrol. After you tell him of what happened to Mogleo, Mogkul resolves to go and aid his comrade-in-arms, and bids you find Mogga and Mogok before one of Nidhogg's brood gives them an unpleasant surprise."],"objectives":["Search for Mogleo.","Report to Mogkul."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOGOK","text":"Zenith is vast...
