Though he had always intended to use his mission to aid House Haillenarte to further this aim, he had not counted on having the famed Warrior of Light to assist him. Eager to take advantage of his good fortune, he makes haste for the airship landing and bids you follow.","The attendant informs you that the airship bound for Camp Cloudtop will be departing shortly.
