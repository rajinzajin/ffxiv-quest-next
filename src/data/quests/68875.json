I shall attend to Runar's ministrations."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Though I am loath to trust him, I suppose we have no choice. For now, at least."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Do you really think he can bring her back?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Could it truly be within his power to pluck Y'shtola from the Lifestream as he claimeth? 'Tis a feat beyond even the greatest practitioners of the arcane. Yet if he would attempt it, we cannot well stand in his way."},{"name":"RUNAR","text":"By the blessed Dark, there is yet hope!"},{"name":"ALMET","text":"I confess, I do not fully understand what is happening here─but I gather we were right to bring this man to you."},{"name":"UIMET","text":"We found him asleep in the shade of a tree near the ruins. A fine way to behave when one's companions are in dire straits."},{"name":"CYMET","text":"I am relieved to know he is an acquaintance of yours. Though I see you are not close. If he should displease you, we would be happy to deal with him..."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Now then, if I'm to fetch her for you, I will require a suitable place to work. We must find somewhere that resonates strongly with the Lifestream."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"And by we, I mean you. To that end, I give you this─an aetherial lamp of my own design."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Keep it close as you venture out into the woods. The brighter the glow, the stronger the location's resonance with the Lifestream. Once you've found a likely spot, all you need do is whistle."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"You do know how to whistle, don't you, hero? Just put your lips together and blow."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To find a location that resonates with the Lifestream, you will need to search the area marked on your map."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Use your aetherial lamp to pinpoint an ideal location then call for Emet-Selch."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Well, what are you standing around here for? Get searching! You <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> want to save her, don't you?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The lamplight is near blinding. Perhaps now would be a good time to call for Emet-Selch."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The lamp glows brightly."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The lamp glows warmly."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The lamp glows faintly."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The lamp is dim, as if it might go out at any moment."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Did Emet-Selch not return with you?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Though I struggle to form the words...I am glad that Emet-Selch was here."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"We can but pray Y'shtola never does anything so reckless again."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Urianger once told me that being immersed in the Lifestream can cause irreparable harm to the body. Do you suppose Y'shtola is all right?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"In all of history, there are but few who have returned from a misadventure in the aetherial sea possessed of mind and body both."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"To have done so <span class=\"emphasis\">twice</span> beggareth belief. 'Tis plain Y'shtola wanteth not for favor among the Twelve."},{"name":"RUNAR","text":"By all that is dark, Master Matoya is returned! She stands here before me yet still I cannot believe it."},{"name":"ALMET","text":"We are both gladdened and relieved to see your companion returned hale and whole."},{"name":"UIMET","text":"With your friend returned, you will resume your exploration of the ruins, yes? But say the word and we shall assist you."},{"name":"CYMET","text":"It was fate who brought you to us, and fate who returned your companion to you. She yet smiles on Ronka, I am sure of it."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"What a touching reunion that was. It fair brought a tear to the eye. But as we both know, such tender moments are nothing if not <span class=\"emphasis\">momentary</span>."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Before long, they will remember their many differences, and return to squabbling."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You're wrong. They're better than that."},{"name":"A1","text":"Says the arch Bringer of Chaos."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Oh, if I had a gil for every time one of you <span class=\"emphasis\">heroes</span> made that claim..."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Ah hah hah! Flattery will get you nowhere, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">my dear</span><span class=\"alternative\">dear boy</span></span>."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"But seriously, we Ascians do what we do for the greater good. For the Rejoining."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Though we may sow the seeds of chaos, it is man who tends them, he who reaps their bountiful harvest."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"But I grow tired of these arguments. If you would kindly refrain from retorting and return to your customary brooding silence, I will take it as thanks for rescuing your companion and leave it at that."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Now, we mustn't keep your friends waiting."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"I told you, I tire of these inane arguments. Shouldn't you be getting ready to slay the next Lightwarden or something?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"My apologies for having put you all through such an ordeal. I could see no other way to save the Night's Blessed. Happily, both they and I yet live─thanks to you."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"But our work here is not yet done.
