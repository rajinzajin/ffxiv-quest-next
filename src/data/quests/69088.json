I saw her on my way back from the mines, and I've been dreaming of her ever since..."},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"They say love is a dance, aye? Well, I've been watching from the edges for long enough─I think it's time I took to the floor!"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"She should be on her way to fetch water from the river soon, but...<br>Gah, I'm too nervous to approach her alone. Would you come with me? Please, you've got to come with me!"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"Thank you─you're the best friend I never had! Off to Boiled Owl Bridge we go!"},{"name":"LADY03552","text":"...Oh! I almost lost my bucket!"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"Look, there she is!<br>This is it, then. I'm just going to...stay right here because I'm a big, bearded coward."},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"...I need another favor from you. Will you ask her if she's wed? And if unwed, then what manner of man makes her swoon? Oh, and make sure to be subtle!"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"I'm like to stumble over my own tongue if I try talking to her now. No, first I need you to ask if she's wed, or, if unwed, her preference in men. Perfectly innocent questions from a perfect stranger!"},{"name":"LADY03552","text":"Oh, weren't you the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lady</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> who was traveling with Alphinaud? He spoke very highly of you, you know. Said he admired both your strength of arm and strength of character."},{"name":"LADY03552","text":"Now, what could such an admirable <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">fellow</span></span> want with a simple girl like me?"},{"name":"LADY03552","text":"...Am I wed? Well, no...and I've no prospects to speak of, neither. Amity is not exactly bursting at the seams with suitors."},{"name":"LADY03552","text":"...And if I were to pick a suitor? Gracious me, you are forward, aren't you?"},{"name":"LADY03552","text":"Hmmm... Well, it's what's on the inside that counts, isn't it? I would hope to meet a soul filled with warmth and kindness─someone much like how Alphinaud described <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>, I suppose."},{"name":"LADY03552","text":"No, I've no interest in how a person looks. I'd seek a partner with your qualities─someone kind and generous."},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"W-Well!? What did she say!?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What did she say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"She looks for kindness."},{"name":"A1","text":"Appearances aren't important."},{"name":"A1","text":"She seemed to like me."},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"...Kindness? What, like the sort of kindness you showed me...?"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"Hm? Is that something other folk judge their partners by?"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"In my village, it ain't considered polite to show your face until <span class=\"emphasis\">after</span> you're wed. Helms stay on outside the family home! Still, it probably helps that she's not concerned with how I look..."},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"...Sh-She did!? And here I thought I'd brought an ally, not a rival!"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"&lt;cough&gt; Well, we should be heading back, then. It ain't right for me to demand help then leave you unpaid for your counsel!"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"I was wrestling with the idea on the way home, and I've come to a conclusion: to win my lady's heart, I need to be more like you!"},{"name":"DWARF03552","text":"I'll travel the world, and make of myself a man worth marrying.
