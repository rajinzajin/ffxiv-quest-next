Now everyone in Eulmore's got something to complain about. Wouldn't want to be in Master Chai's shoes, having to keep that lot happy..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"All we know for certain is that Master Chai has shown great concern not only for Eulmore, but its surrounding settlements."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It seems logical, then, that having consulted those within the city walls, he would wish to do the same to those without."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, if you would go and make inquiries in Wright, I shall do likewise in Stilltide. Gatetown I leave to you, Kai-Shirr."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Fair enough. Where should we meet when we've finished?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well...Top Rung would seem to me to be his next most likely destination."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Let us reconvene there. With any luck, one of us will have stumbled upon him by then, but if not, we will be well situated to continue our search."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"With Vauthry gone, I had hoped things would change for the better, but this place seems little different from before. Perhaps they need more time..."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Don't worry, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I know Gatetown like the back of my hand. If Master Chai's here, I'll find him in no time."},{"name":"HASTELOT","text":"...No, the name doesn't ring any bells. But there <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span> a rather dapper-looking Mystel gentleman here not long ago. He wanted to talk about relations between Wright and Eulmore─or rather the lack of them."},{"name":"HASTELOT","text":"We lost a great many people to their promises of meol and the chance of a lavish life among the free."},{"name":"HASTELOT","text":"And Vauthry thought to take even more from us, conscripting the few able-bodied men we had left to guard his <span class=\"emphasis\">paradise</span>."},{"name":"HASTELOT","text":"I needn't tell you what happened when the sin eaters came... Such things are hard to forgive."},{"name":"HASTELOT","text":"But Vauthry's gone now, and we're curious to see what will become of Eulmore in his absence."},{"name":"HASTELOT","text":"That's what I told your friend...Chai-Nuzz, was it? And I'm sure the others said the same. Not what he wanted to hear, I suppose, because he left soon after. And that was that."},{"name":"HASTELOT","text":"I hope we didn't do anything to give him offense, but you can't blame us for being wary. Not after all that's happened. If Eulmore one day shows signs of real change, perhaps we'll lend him a friendlier ear."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Turns out Master Chai was over in Gatetown too. He spoke to a few of the residents, apparently. They told me they'd never seen a posh bloke look so miserable."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"So he paid a visit to both Wright and Gatetown as well, did he?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I see. Kai-Shirr and I gleaned much the same."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"He seems determined to salvage what goodwill might yet remain among the settlements of Kholusia, the only likely place he has left to go being Amity."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Come. If we are quick, we may yet catch up with him."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Alphinaud! Kai-Shirr! Wh-What are you doing here!?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We might ask you the same, Master Chai. We have been looking all over for you."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Looking for me? Whatever for?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Lady Chai has been nigh inconsolable in your absence. She claims you disappeared without so much as a word, and bade us return you to her side."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"What in blazes are you talking about? I left a letter for her in our chambers."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Though I suppose she <span class=\"emphasis\">could</span> have overlooked it... And when she gets an idea into her head... &lt;sigh&gt; I can only apologize."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"No harm done, Master Chai. But since we are here, might I ask what compelled you to come all this way?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We were told you had been elected mayor, and from what we have gathered from the nearby villages, you have been inquiring about the people's grievances."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Is it safe to assume you mean to take office?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Now, now, let's not jump to conclusions!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I <span class=\"emphasis\">did</span> seek to learn about the problems faced by the people of Kholusia, that much is true. But I am by no means sure I am the man to solve them."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Tackling our many challenges will require resources, and until I have secured them, it would not be right to assume the role of mayor."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I see. And you believe said resources can be found here?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Indeed. The people's grievances are many, but in the course of my inquiries, I have already met with several individuals willing to lend their aid in addressing them."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"However, there remains one individual crucial to my plans. A man whose counsel might yet make a mayor of me."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"With respect, such forethought is, in itself, proof of your suitability."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The city needs you, Master Chai. And I am certain this man of whom you speak─whoever he may be─will reach the same conclusion. For what little it is worth, we will vouch for you should he require convincing."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Whatever you need, you can count on us."},{"name":"A2","text":"We believe in you, Master Chai!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I...I don't know what to say..."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"You don't need to say anything. You've got your actions to speak for you."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"For as long as I can remember, all I ever wanted was to make it into Eulmore. But that dream's gone now, burst like a bubble─or a boil, more like."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Anyway, outside of repaying Master Alphinaud, I haven't had a clue what to do with myself. Spent most days in a daze. But you? You've been running up and down, trying to find a way to fix this mess for everyone."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"And I reckon you can do it. You got this lot up Mt. Gulg, didn't you? How hard could mayoring be? You're going to steer Eulmore to a better future, I know it."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"And I want to help. Properly help. Do something that makes a difference."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"I don't know what it is yet, but I'll work it out on the way. If you let me come with you, that is."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"You give me entirely too much credit, the lot of you...but I can't deny it gives me heart. Come, then. Let us press on together."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Thank you, Master Chai!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. Eulmore needs more than a man with good intentions. Which is why I am here─to find one with the experience needed to see the city thrive."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Who is this man, exactly, and are you certain he's here in Amity?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Wrenden is his name, and yes, he is. Or was. I had scarcely begun to explain myself when he decided his time was better spent elsewhere. "},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"He served as chief advisor to Vauthry's father when he was in office."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"If Ran'jit was the mayor's right hand, one might say Wrenden was the left, and between them, they kept Eulmore on the road to prosperity."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"The city needs more than a mere man of business─which is why I must find him."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"But even if you do, what makes you think he will listen?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Before giving chase, might it not be wise to speak with those who know him, here in Amity? They may be able to shed some light on his reason for rejecting your overtures out of hand."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Yes, I suppose that makes sense. Perhaps we should start with Tristol, then. As I recall, you made rather a favorable impression on him. I'm certain he would be willing to talk to us."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"I reckon Eulmore could learn a thing or two from Amity about standing on its own two feet. Then again, so could I. "},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"According to Master Chai, this Wrenden fellow occupied a position of considerable influence in the Eulmoran leadership. Which begs the question: why did he choose to leave?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I realize it was me who suggested speaking with Tristol, but who's to say he will be any more receptive than Wrenden? Why should <span class=\"emphasis\">any</span> of them give me the time of day? ...Bah, that's no way to think. Ignore me."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"Greetings, friend. And to you too, Master Chai. I presume you are here to ask after Wrenden? I couldn't help overhearing your earlier...exchange."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Yes, well...with Vauthry gone, Eulmore wants for a leader. Should no one rise to the challenge, the city could very well collapse. I came here seeking Wrenden's counsel in the hope that we could build a better Eulmore together─and that is still my wish. But given how abominably you were mistreated there, I will quite understand if you choose not to help."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"Worry not, Master Chai. I bear no grudge against you or the people of Eulmore, and I would not see you suffer for Vauthry's villainy."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"As you no doubt gathered from your meeting earlier, Wrenden can be rather uncompromising. He has his principles, you see, and little patience for anyone he deems less committed to their own."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"Your desire to right the wrongs of your past, of Eulmore's past, is quite admirable. But I fear the guilt you bear on the city's behalf works against you."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"I can see it in your eyes, in the way you carry yourself. It goes without saying he sees it as well. You must let those feelings go, Master Chai. Be more assertive─<span class=\"emphasis\">commit to this course</span>─and prove to him Eulmore has the resolve to change."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"The resolve to change..."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"I believe he was heading towards Pit 8 when he left. If you plan to go and speak with him, I suggest you be firm and clear in your intentions."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Very well. To Pit 8 we shall go. And I will not take no for an answer. Nay, not even a maybe!"},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"Despite our previous...artistic differences, I do believe Master Chai means what he says. But until <span class=\"emphasis\">he</span> starts believing it, I fear it won't amount to an awful lot."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Imagine it... A Eulmore that even a bloke like me could help to build..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"People cannot be brought together on the strength of high ideals alone. This I know from painful experience. Wrenden was right to demand proof of Master Chai's commitment."},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"It remains to be seen if his words will translate into deeds, but I shall endeavor to keep an open mind."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Ahem! Right, then. Is there a particular issue you would have me resolve?"},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"You seem to have conducted an assessment of the problems Eulmore now faces. I assume you will agree, therefore, that the matter of dwindling food stores is the most pressing."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Ah, yes... Meol being neither a desirable, nor less <span class=\"emphasis\">sustainable</span> option, I assume alternative foodstuffs are now required to fill the void."},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"And a man who hungers is not like to contribute much to society...save violence, perhaps."},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"So tell me: how do you propose to solve this problem? Give me a satisfactory answer, and I will consider offering you my counsel."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Hmmm... A combination of measures would seem to be in order. One to address the immediate issue of supply, and another, that of production."},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"Go on..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"For the present, Eulmore's coffers can be used to purchase food from our neighbors. This would afford us time to address the underlying problem that affects us all─the long-standing neglect of agriculture."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"The villages that once served as sources of trade for foodstuffs must be repopulated, their means of production restored."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"This assumes, of course, that we can rekindle relations with our neighbors, guarantee security and stability in the region, and most importantly, find people willing to leave the city and take up the rebuilding effort."},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"My, my... Think of that all by yourself, did you?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Well...yes. It began as a rather abstract plan I drafted some time ago, after speaking with the peoples of Eulmore and the nearby settlements."},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"Hmph.<br>...You've impressed me, Chai-Nuzz."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Uh─ I have? Well, that <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> a relief!"},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"Oh, you haven't secured my support just yet. Only my attention. Grand plans will not be enough to persuade the masses. If you would ask them to rebuild, you must provide them the means to do so."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"A fair point, Wrenden. And one to which I have given much thought. I propose the use of Talos to aid in the establishment and maintenance of these settlements. Their employment should drastically improve efficiency, and ultimately increase production."},{"name":"WRENDEN","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Talos</span>? But Daedalus Stoneworks closed their doors years ago. Without a ready supply of the necessary equipment, the people would starve before your plans could be put into effect."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Well, as the heir to Daedalus Stoneworks, it just so happens that Talos are my field of expertise."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"And with a little help, I'm quite certain we can acquire what we need in no time at all."}],"reward":{"gil":1339,"items":[{"num":2,"id":27892,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":27888,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":27889,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":27890,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":27994,"one":1}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":142}],"quests":[69214]},"next":[69216]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1031746","obj":{"i":1031746,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2952,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1031760","obj":{"i":1031760,"n":"Chai-Nuzz","l":2954,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"27892","obj":{"i":27892,"n":"Exquisite Beef Stew","l":450,"c":24110,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"27888","obj":{"i":27888,"n":"Pixieberry Cheesecake","l":450,"c":24070,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"27889","obj":{"i":27889,"n":"Kukuru Rusk","l":450,"c":24090,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"27890","obj":{"i":27890,"n":"Lemon Curd Sachertorte","l":450,"c":24071,"t":46}},{"type":"item","id":"27994","obj":{"i":27994,"n":"Nightworld Silver Piece","l":385,"c":26001,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"69214","obj":{"i":69214,"n":"A Notable Absence","g":9,"l":"Eulmore","s":60}},{"type":"quest","id":"69216","obj":{"i":69216,"n":"Finding Good Help","g":9,"l":"Kholusia","s":80}}]}
