Like a good historian─or a tactician─Wandering Breeze wants to study the threat. Slay four gigas and search their remains for items of interest.","You find a jagged piece of crystal on each of the gigas, the only things out of place among their effects. The crystals seem to be carved in some fashion, but analyzing them is well beyond your area of expertise. Perhaps Wandering Breeze will have better luck.","Wandering Breeze theorizes that the gigas consider the Crystal Tower a holy place, and seek to claim it for themselves. Place the carved likeness of the Tower on the chosen spot, and see what happens.","Being a mite fuzzy on what a scientific observation entails, you slay the gigas who comes to retrieve the crystal. The dead giant carries with him a detailed sketch of the Crystal Tower. Curious indeed. Hand it to Wandering Breeze and see what he says.","The drawing turns out to be from the documents stolen from the Sons of Saint Coinach. Do these fell creatures also burn to discover the secret of the Crystal Tower? If so, they may be an even greater threat than was supposed..."],"objectives":["Collect artifacts from the gigas.","Give the crystals to Wandering Breeze.","Place the likeness of the Crystal Tower in a likely spot.","Give the document to Wandering Breeze."],"dialogue":[{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"It would seem our trouble with the gigas outlives the troublemakers themselves. The creatures stole some research documents, of all things."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"We may have underestimated them. Why would they steal such a thing? What hidden aspects do they have? We must know more of their ways."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"Since observation is out of the question, we must collect artifacts. Thaliak's Razor dictates that we go straight to the source: gigas. Your task is to slay four of them and collect anything of interest upon their persons."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"You return, and I see you have not been idle. Did you find anything of note?"},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"What's this? Pieces of crystal? I don't understand why you would─ Oh...they are all carved to some degree. Interesting. They each have a certain statuesque quality to them."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"...<span class=\"emphasis\">This</span> one, in particular, is recognizable. It is crude, but this likeness is of the Crystal Tower. I cannot see a gigas taking the time to shape such a thing solely for amusement."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"Ah! I had almost forgotten, but there was a report two moons ago from another party molested by gigas. They, too, encountered such a crystal. And from their studies of it, they made out two words: “holy place.”"},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"The gigas may venerate the Crystal Tower. This may explain their migration following the Calamity, as well..."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, will you observe the gigas from a place well hid, after placing this likeness in plain sight? We naturalists lack the necessary training to risk such an observation, but I have every confidence you will remain undetected."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"You observed them? What I would not give to have been there! What manner of things did you see?"},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"This is from the documents reported lost to the gigas. We had thought it had been carried off pell-mell, but you say one who looked the chief among them had it?"},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"He tore a sketch of the Crystal Tower from the records, and kept it as a precious thing. We must conclude that the Tower is indeed holy to them."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"Gigas have been known to lead other giantkind, for they have the cleverness for it."},{"name":"WANDERINGBREEZE","text":"If they can lead, they can create an army. If they can worship, they can start a crusade...or so history tells us. These are matters we must be mindful of.
