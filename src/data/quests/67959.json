The creature was last seen making for the city; should it cause a commotion there, the blame is like to fall upon the festival. Nonotta bids you return with her to Gridania in order to alert Jihli at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","Jihli informs you that the spriggan has indeed come to Gridania and begun making mischief, startling townsfolk indiscriminately. At this rate, the Wood Wailers may be dispatched to hunt down the unwelcomed intruder. Dismayed by the prospect of violence, Jihli is determined to resolve the matter peacefully, and bids you reach out to the spriggan. Find the creature at Greatloam Growery and <span class=\"highlight\">soothe</span> him.","You find the spriggan, one Riggy, greatly agitated, but succeed in calming him down. From what you can make of his limited vocabulary, the creature was merely mimicking your actions in hopes of making people happy. Jihli invites Riggy to be an official part of the festival, and together they head back to Hyrstmill. Make your own way there and speak with Nonotta to learn what manner of plans they have in store.","According to Nonotta, Riggy is happily playing out in the forest. Having had his fill of startling, the spriggan now wishes to be startled for a change, and it falls to you to deal the shocks. Speak with Motte when you are ready to ride the egg and set about your task.","Motte helps you onto eggback and furnishes you further instructions. While on eggback, search for Riggy at his hiding place and startle him with the shockobo.<br><br>※Speak with Motte at Hyrstmill to ride the eggshilaration system.","You find and startle Riggy, much to his delight. Keen for another shock, the spriggan goes off to hide himself again. While on eggback, search for Riggy at his next hiding place and startle him with the shockobo.<br><br>※Speak with Motte at Hyrstmill to ride the eggshilaration system.","You find and startle Riggy again, and again the spriggan goes off to hide himself. While on eggback, search for Riggy at his last hiding place and startle him with the shockobo.<br><br>※Speak with Motte at Hyrstmill to ride the eggshilaration system.","You find and startle Riggy for the third and last time. Though the spriggan is sad that the fun must end, he goes off well satisfied. Your task now complete, return to Hyrstmill and present your three hard-earned shock eggs to Nonotta.","You show Nonotta your haul of shock eggs, after which Riggy arrives with other festival helpers in tow. Reflecting upon recent events, Jihli experiences an epiphany: the gemstone in her dream is none other than Riggy, who rode atop his magnificent rock and spread dazzling smiles to those around him. Grateful for your part in making her vision a reality, she spontaneously decides to gift you the eggshilaration system. Loath to part with her creation, Nonotta inadvertently reveals its secret, but much to her surprise, the truth impresses rather than upsets Jihli. After a tender moment, she undergoes a change of heart and gives you her blessing to be the proud owner of a hovering egg. May it bear you to all you have ever dreamed."],"objectives":["Speak with Jihli Aliapoh in Gridania.","/soothe Riggy.","Speak with Nonotta at Hyrstmill.","Speak with Motte.","Ride the eggshilaration system and launch the shockobo at Riggy.","Deliver the shock eggs to Nonotta."],"dialogue":[{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"You'll help us?

I-I thought you'd be upset that it's a contrivance rather than a gift from the Archons of old."},{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"The Archons work in mysterious ways, dear Nonotta. It was by their guidance, I believe, that you built the egg─an egg fit to serve as their vessel. I'm very proud of you."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"&lt;sob&gt; That means a lot to me, Jihli.
