Events in Garlemald reinforce their suspicions that the onslaught of lunar primals is only a precursor to a far more deadly crisis─a crisis which must be stopped at any cost. As you ponder your options, Tataru interrupts the gathering to bring word from Krile that you may now journey unto Sharlayan, as well as instructions to make all haste to the docks in Limsa Lominsa.","After an emotional farewell, you board the ship bound for Sharlayan. At sea you are greeted by a most unexpected visitor, Hydaelyn, who confirms some of what you know, and hints at more that you do not. Her weighty words still echo in your mind as the famous city of scholars appears on the horizon...","Your entry into Sharlayan is not as smooth as you had hoped, but the timely arrival of Krile and her convincing arguments is enough to assuage the immigration officer's suspicions. Nevertheless, you deem it wise to move some distance away from the bureaucrat before you discuss the delicate matters at hand.","Krile expresses relief at your safe arrival, and bids you take a moment to regain your land legs. If you are to embark on a quest for answers, you must mind your step on the treacherous path ahead..."],"objectives":["Speak with Tataru in Limsa Lominsa.","Speak with Krile."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, do you have some time to talk?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I would like to gather everyone in Dawn's Respite and together assess the situation in which we find ourselves..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Let us take stock of the facts, shall we? The crisis at hand began with the sudden appearance of ominous towers in a multitude of locations throughout the world."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We have since learned that said structures were brought into being by an organization known as the “Telophoroi.”"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The Telophoroi's stated purpose is to recreate the Final Days of eons past, an apocalyptic event that would result in the destruction of all we hold dear. Already have these towers of theirs been the cause of untold suffering."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Countless innocents kidnapped and imprisoned, their faith perverted for primal summonings..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And unless we find a way to deal with the corruptive aura surrounding the spires, we can't even get close enough to rescue anyone."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Those shielded with the blessing of Light seem able to resist being tempered, at least."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But after what happened to Arenvald and Fordola, we need to be very, very careful about how we proceed..."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Yet while these threats close to home are of paramount concern, we mustn't lose sight of the situation in Garlemald."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"As you know, the Telophoroi are under the leadership of Fandaniel and one other delightful fellow: Zenos yae Galvus, the crown prince and our dear friend."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"To date, he's reclaimed his old body, murdered Emperor Varis, and plunged Garlemald into an even deeper pit of chaos."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"The capital has probably seen the worst of it. For a good while there, it saw the bloodiest fighting in the war of succession. But that has since changed─and in troubling ways..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Aye, during our reconnaissance, the air was not once rent by the barking of cannons or the cries of discord. 'Twas an eerie fog of silence which did blanket that ruined city."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"The inhabitants appeared to have been tempered, and with nary a word spoken did they labor to transform the palace into a soaring edifice born of nightmares."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"If they were indeed made thralls, it seems safe to assume that these events, too, were orchestrated by the Telophoroi."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"An army of primals is awful enough, but in light of recent developments, I fear it is only the prelude to an even greater catastrophe."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"We need to devise a means to counter this threat, and quickly, before our allies are overwhelmed."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"We will find a way in Sharlayan, I am sure of it."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Master Fourchenault's comments regarding the Final Days were curious to say the least.

She says that arrangements for your visit have been finalized."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"You're to head to Limsa Lominsa and board the next ship bound for Sharlayan..."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"And on arrival, present yourselves as “associates of the Students of Baldesion,” come to assist with the order's restoration."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"The arrangements may be settled, but what of your thoughts? They must race at the prospect of returning home after so long."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...I am eager to see it, of course. Of course... Ahem. We should set off at once!"},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Then I'll accompany you to the docks.

And please, do be careful!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Though a part of me looks forward to returning home, I've not forgotten that my father stripped us of the privileges of our family name. I hope it doesn't cause trouble with the officials upon our arrival..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"What a grim reason to bring you to Sharlayan. Not much to be done about it, I suppose, but I would've liked to give you the grand tour under happier circumstances."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Contrary to what you might think, this will be like going home for me as well. I may have learned how to survive in Limsa Lominsa, but it was in Sharlayan where I was taught─quite relentlessly, I might add─the skills to properly <span class=\"emphasis\">live</span>."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I shudder to think what manner of truth awaiteth us beyond the Indigo Deep. Still more do I dread the prospect of discussions long overdue..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I might have lived in Master Matoya's cave for a good part of my life, but even for me, the thought of “returning” to Sharlayan is quite exciting. I can hardly imagine how it is for the others who lived most of their lives there."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I never thought the day would come when I would be sailing home again. It always seemed so very far away..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Sea travel can be tedious, but I don't mind it. 'Tis a rare experience for most Ishgardians."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Everyone's here!

Honestly. Better to be waved through with a stern warning than be denied entry, after all."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"That was about as awkward as expected. Still, we're here now, and that's all that matters!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Even allowing that the years I spent in the First passed here in the blink of an eye, the city feels untouched by time..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Allow me to extend unto thee my warmest welcome, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.
