Speak with O'kalkaya and see what troubles her.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","O'kalkaya of the Sanguine Sirens is concerned for Captain Rhoswen, who she suspects is preparing in secret for a fateful confrontation with the Kraken's Arms, the Sirens' longtime archrivals. Speak with Guildmaster Lyngsath at the Bismarck, which Rhoswen has been frequenting often in recent days.","Lyngsath is reluctant to share Rhoswen's secrets, offering only a cryptic comment that whatever the two are preparing, it is sure to cause sparks. Deliver this somewhat concerning news to O'kalkaya.","Your report strikes fear into O'kalkaya, who is now convinced that her captain is preparing firesand for a showdown with the Krakens. No sooner does she voice this concern, however, than she realizes that a Kraken deckhand has overheard the entire conversation. She bids you go in pursuit of the man.","The Kraken deckhand smugly informs you that he has already relayed what he overheard to his captain, who would speak with you about the matter. Seek out Carvallain at the Seventh Sage.","It would appear that O'kalkaya's concerns were not unfounded, as Carvallain reveals that Rhoswen has challenged him to a duel. Suspecting that the Siren has some underhanded scheme up her sleeve, he insists that you serve as witness to ensure a fair fight. Travel to the designated location ahead of Carvallain to put a preemptive stop to any foul play.","You are not entirely sure whether you just witnessed a duel or a botched confession of love, but whatever it was, it is mercifully over, with only a single piece of Rhoswen's chocolate remaining in the aftermath. Return the captain's confection to her crewman O'kalkaya.","O'kalkaya is taken aback upon realizing the true meaning behind the challenge. To defend her captain's honor, she insists that you speak not a word of what has transpired, offering a small gift to buy your silence. One can only hope that Rhoswen's wounds do not cut too deep."],"objectives":["Speak with O'kalkaya.","Speak with Lyngsath.","Speak with O'kalkaya.","Speak with the Kraken's Arms deckhand.","Speak with Carvallain.","Wait at the designated location.","Deliver the chocolate to O'kalkaya."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LISSETE","text":"Across the realm, hearts pine and yearn. How fare you in bringing them succor?"},{"name":"LISSETE","text":"You know not where to look? Why did you not say so sooner!? By the powers vested in me by my ancestors, I shall divine for you the whereabouts of a heart in need!"},{"name":"LISSETE","text":"What's this? Even strapping seawives are no strangers to pangs of the heart, 'twould seem. Yes, a young Siren by the name of O'kalkaya, not a stone's throw from where we stand, awaits you, though she is not like to speak willingly of her plight."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"If yer lookin' fer a place to wet yer whistle, scrag, I'd advise ye to turn tail an' run."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"...Hm. A landlubber who can look a Sanguine Siren in the eye an' not flinch? Ye've got more guts than most, I'll give ye that."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"Look, I ain't the type to warm to strangers, but I'm comin' to the end of me rope. Perhaps ye can do me a favor?"},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"It's our cap'n, y'see. She's in a foul mood of late─fouler even than usual, which is sayin' quite a bit."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"What's more, she's been sneakin' about late at night, and to the Bismarck of all places. Call it sailor's intuition, but sure as the tide, I swear there's somethin' amiss... Could a showdown with those bloody Krakens be a-brewin'?"},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"The cap'n's a tough mistress, but she's always been there for us, and I'll not abandon 'er in a time of need. Ye'll investigate for me, won't ye? Lyngsath should be able to tell ye a thing or two."},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"Cap'n Rhoswen? Aye, she was 'ere the other night. What's it to ye?"},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"What sort o' chef would I be if I went about blabbin' me customers' secrets to any swab who walked through these doors, eh? Aye, a dead one, like as not. So let's just say she's asked me to whip up somethin' that's sure to make some sparks! Hah hah!"},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"“Sparks,” 'e said!? Aye, that can mean only one thing─firesand. No doubt a showdown with those low-down Krakens is close at hand. But why the Bismarck? To hide the explosives from our foe's wanderin' eyes, ye reckon?"},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"Hm!?"},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"Blast! That Kraken spy 'eard everything! Quick, after the scurvy dog!"},{"name":"KANPAN","text":"You're a bell late and a million gil short, landlubber. I've already told the captain everything I heard."},{"name":"KANPAN","text":"...Not that I needed to. Yes, the schemings of those uncultured Sirens are as easy to read as the stars in the sky."},{"name":"KANPAN","text":"You've got some nerve showing yourself here after befriending that bunch. Fortunately for you, we Krakens are a more civilized lot, aye."},{"name":"KANPAN","text":"As a matter of fact, the captain has expressed a desire for a parley with you. If you're wise, you'll not keep him waiting long."},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"Welcome. You're a brave <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> indeed to come here. But fear not─I wish only to talk."},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"You consort with the Sanguine Sirens, yes? I doubt I need tell you that the feud between Kraken and Siren is an old one, dating back to the years before we united under the Admiral's flag."},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"Just yesterday, a missive from Captain Rhoswen was delivered to me, challenging me to a duel. It would appear that my rival has at long last summoned the courage to settle the score between us. Needless to say, I welcome the challenge, but I will stand for no less than an honest fight."},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"As an adventurer, you are not beholden to either crew. I would ask that you serve as witness to the duel. The place is the Anchor Yard, and the hour...is almost nigh. Hurry there to ensure my opponent plots no treachery, and I shall follow promptly."},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"The Siren does not show? No doubt she has come to realize that she is hopelessly overmatched. Victory by default is hardly as satisfying, but it is victory nonetheless."},{"name":"RHOSWEN","text":"Save yer godsdamned blabberin' for when the battle is done...if ye've still got a mouth to speak with, that is."},{"name":"RHOSWEN","text":"That said, I do give ye credit─I reckoned ye'd be too much of a scurvy coward to even show yer face."},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"Hah! I fear you vastly overestimate your own capacity for intimidation. Why, I would have challenged you sooner if I did not fear for the repercussions on your delicate heart."},{"name":"RHOSWEN","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Delicate</span>!? I've been ready for this day since ye were sucklin' at yer mum's teat!"},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"...Ever the songstress. Doubtless 'tis your silver tongue that earned you the name of Siren, yes? But enough talk─have at you!"},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"What in the─!?"},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"This ambrosial aroma. This couldn't possibly be...chocolate!?"},{"name":"RHOSWEN","text":"B-Bloody ridiculous! You watch yer tongue, or I'll rip it from yer throat!"},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"Ah, yes. Distract me with your feminine wiles, and then strike when my guard is down? I fear your feeble ruse will not avail you today. I prefer my ladies a bit more...refined, you see."},{"name":"RHOSWEN","text":"R-Refined!? Bah, 'ave it yer way!"},{"name":"RHOSWEN","text":"No woman in 'er right mind would fall for a puffy-shirted fop like you, anyway! What in the seven 'ells was I even thinkin'!?"},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"...Ahem. I am not entirely certain what just transpired, but what I <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> know is that this has been a dreadful waste of my valuable time."},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"As witness to the duel, I ask that you see to the disposal of that suspicious substance in my stead. It simply will not do to leave such hazardous materials lying about."},{"name":"CARVALLAIN","text":"I suggest you return it to the Sirens responsible for its creation. If not that vulgar Rhoswen herself, then one of her lackeys. Now, if you will excuse me, more important matters demand my attention."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"I thought ye'd never return! Whatever 'appened at the duel? The cap'n just returned, and I 'aven't seen 'er seethe like this in ages!"},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"Eh? What's this ye 'ave 'ere? <span class=\"emphasis\">This</span> is what the cap'n got from the Bismarck? The smell ain't like any firesand I've..."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"...Oho! So that's what ol' Lyngsath meant when 'e spoke of makin' sparks."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"After all these years on 'er crew, I thought I knew the cap'n, but it'd seem she still 'ides a secret or two up 'er sleeve."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"If ye value yer tongue, ye'll not speak a word of this about town. We Sirens 'ave a reputation to protect, aye."},{"name":"OKALKAYA","text":"'Ere, take this for yer troubles. Now if ye'll excuse me, I reckon the cap'n's lookin' for someone with whom to drown 'er sorrows."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have successfully assisted House Valentione in spreading love to all three city–states."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Return to the festival square in Limsa Lominsa and inform Lisette de Valentione that you have done your duty."}],"reward":{"gil":382,"items":[{"num":2,"id":6998},{"num":2,"id":6999}],"xp":1680},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}],"quests":[66833]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1005591","obj":{"i":1005591,"n":"Lisette De Valentione","l":28,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000919","obj":{"i":1000919,"n":"O'kalkaya","l":28,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000915","obj":{"i":1000915,"n":"Carvallain","l":28,"q":6}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000947","obj":{"i":1000947,"n":"Lyngsath","l":28,"q":22,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"item","id":"6998","obj":{"i":6998,"n":"Bitter Heart Chocolate","l":1,"c":24063,"t":85}},{"type":"item","id":"6999","obj":{"i":6999,"n":"Pure Heart Chocolate","l":1,"c":24065,"t":85}},{"type":"quest","id":"66833","obj":{"i":66833,"n":"The Puissance of Love","g":196,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":24}}]}
