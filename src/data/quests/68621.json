Far removed from the glowing lights and cheers of the crowd before them, however, they spied an unexpected sight─a young girl sulking by her lonesome, seemingly lost. Knowing they cannot abandon their tight schedule of performances, the royal seneschal turns to you for help in locating this wayward soul.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You find a young girl near the Gate of Nald, sullen and withdrawn. She has lost a gift from her parents─a necklace and pair of earrings─and is too racked with worry to enjoy the day's festivities. Your offer to search for them in her stead is met with disbelief followed by heartfelt gratitude. She tells you she remembers where they were lost, but rather than explain in words, she draws you a picture of the location. With her artwork in hand, you exit the gate out into central Thanalan.","Finding a vista resembling the young girl's drawing was no easy task, but eventually a familiar view catches your eye. Indeed, you have found the correct locale, and an inspection of the area turns up a necklace and earrings. They are so old and worn, however, you question if they are what you were sent to find. The only thing left to do is return to Ul'dah and see if the jewelry you found is truly hers.","The young girl is overcome with joy at the sight of the jewelry. She is taken by the ardor with which you came to her aid, saying she at last knows what it means to be treated as a princess for a day. Before leaving to join in the Little Ladies' Day celebration, she makes a final request: deliver her necklace and earrings to a man named Tobyn at Crescent Cove.","Tobyn takes the jewelry in hand and quickly turns pale. After you explain what brought you out to Crescent Cove, he hesitantly concludes that the young girl you encountered was the spirit of his late aunt. She disappeared as a child on Little Ladies' Day, her family of the belief she was abducted and sold for some nefarious end. The reason for her ghostly visit to Ul'dah, he believes, is she never had the opportunity to enjoy Little Ladies' Day and be treated like a princess. But thanks to you, her unfinished business is complete. The royal seneschal will certainly be happy to hear the news.","The royal seneschal is shocked to hear of your paranormal encounter. Though he finds your story implausible, he takes solace in knowing the girl's spirit is finally at rest."],"objectives":["Search for the lonesome lass.","Search for the location in the lonesome lass's watercolor sketch to find her missing jewelry.","Deliver the tarnished necklace and faded earrings to the lonesome lass in Ul'dah.","Deliver the tarnished necklace and faded earrings to Tobyn in western Thanalan at Crescent Cove.","Report to the royal seneschal in Ul'dah on Emerald Avenue."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Should you choose to undertake this quest, you will receive no guidance from the journal or the duty list.
