It is you. How much of my grumbling did you hear?"},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"An elder's torment knows no end. I sent my niece out to gather branches for a bow, but she has yet to return. Knowing her pious nature, doubtless she is lost in prayer under some tree or the other."},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"While I would never deny her her faith, she must learn not to neglect her worldly duties. My warnings fall on deaf ears, however. Perhaps you can succeed where I failed. Could you speak with her on my behalf? She is likely somewhere in the Wild Fete.

Please tell Lanille that I shall be home soon."},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"You have returned. I hope she did not prove too troublesome."},{"name":"LANILLE","text":"So, even a warrior such as you can be convinced to say a humble prayer? Perhaps there is power in her conviction after all.
