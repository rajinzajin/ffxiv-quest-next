He has provided the materials, but the facilities are another matter; only those in Hyrstmill, under the care of Dametta, will do. Journey to the hamlet and request her permission.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Dametta is willing to grant you permission to use her facilities─provided you carry out a simple task in exchange. She has prepared a hearty meal for Paulemont, a Wood Wailer stationed at E–Tatt's Spire. You need only deliver the meal and return with the sack which held her previous delivery. Alternatively, you could converse with the woman further and attempt to persuade her...but that approach may not end well.","Paulemont is relieved to receive the meal from someone other than Dametta for a change. He presses an empty sack into your hands and insists that you not forget to return it to his benefactor.","The sack serves both to inflame Dametta's passions and satisfy her requirements. With the materials provided to you by Yazel Ahuatan, synthesize a bladder lining component, and deliver it to him at Ehcatl.<br><br>※In the event that the status <span class=\"highlight\">Facility Access: Production</span> wears off or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Dametta.","Yazel Ahuatan accepts your work with a mighty squa-hawk, certain that it will meet with Methuli's satisfaction. The most modest of Ixal's posterior shall remain pristine...until next he incurs the wrath of the Hard."],"objectives":["Speak with Dametta.","Deliver the handmade meal to Paulemont.","Present the empty meal sack and the bladder lining component materials to Dametta.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize a bladder lining component</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the bladder lining component to Yazel Ahuatan the Able</span></span>."],"dialogue":[{"name":"YAZELAHUATAN","text":"Squa-hawk!

Squa-hawk! Those of Hyrstmill, suffice they shall, but welcome within their walls, Yazel is not. With featherless chatterbox, featherless <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">craftswoman</span><span class=\"alternative\">craftsman</span></span> should speak."},{"name":"YAZELAHUATAN","text":"Highly unattractive, Yazel's posterior would be, if plucked bare of feathers. For the sake of Ixali maidens, with my materials and the featherless chatterbox's facilities, craft the component we require! Squa-hawk!"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"I know that look─you've a mind to use these facilities, don't you? It's hardly the first time, suffice it to say. I find it quite flattering, actually─and who wouldn't? That the facilities I've worked so hard to maintain are in such high demand is high praise indeed!"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"However! That same demand means that I cannot allow unrestricted access, I'm sorry to say. Oh, don't look at me like that! Can you imagine the state they would be in if I let every traveler have the run of the place? It'd be no better than a pigsty!"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"But worry not! You may use them if you take this lunch to Paulemont at E–Tatt's Spire. A simple delivery should be no trouble for a strapping adventurer like yourself! Oh, and do remember to bring me any empty containers he may have. I reuse them, you see. One must <span class=\"emphasis\">never</span> be wasteful!"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"Paulemont never leaves his post, so I've no doubt you'll find him at E–Tatt's Spire. Nevertheless, I pray you don't take too long to deliver it! Meals are always best served fresh!"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"Such a dedicated Wailer, Paulemont is─and kind, too! I used to send him Mun–Tuy tonic, and do you know what he did? He shared it with his comrades when supplies ran low!"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"Just between you and me, he's quite handsome too! Much more than my husband, that's for sure. Oh, but don't go getting any ideas─I'd never do anything <span class=\"emphasis\">indecent</span>. But a woman has eyes, you know!"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"Like the other day, when a horde of ravenous opo–opos burst through the gates and began raiding our storehouses, a party of courageous adventurers came to our defense. So strong and skilled they were─and <span class=\"emphasis\">fetching</span> too! One young man in particular had such <span class=\"emphasis\">lovely</span> arms, and for a moment I couldn't help but imagine them wrapped around me..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"As Dametta continues to wax poetic about various men, your mind begins to wander..."},{"name":"PAULEMONT","text":"Gods save me, today's the day, isn't it? She'll be here any moment..."},{"name":"PAULEMONT","text":"Is that from Dametta? I, uh... Thank you! Here, don't forget this! No need for her to come all this way to fetch an empty sack, am I right?"},{"name":"PAULEMONT","text":"All things considered, it could be far worse. At least she's not forcing that gods-awful tonic on me anymore."},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"I do so hope Paulemont wasn't disappointed that I couldn't deliver his meal in person. I trust you've brought the empty sack? Oh, and as a precaution, I must ask that you present your materials for inspection as well. You would be <span class=\"emphasis\">shocked</span> by what some people have tried to make here, believe me!"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"My word, would you look how spotless it is! Nothing more satisfying than seeing that your man─ahem, that your <span class=\"emphasis\">friend</span> didn't leave a single crumb. Ahem. Ah, yes, your materials! Though unusual, I don't believe they could be used for evil ends. Here you are. You'll note I didn't return them all─there are several times the required materials, it would seem. Whoever entrusted this task to you left a note in the bag: “To featherless neuker, give only required parts. In case of failure, retain spares.” Hmmm... What in the world is a “neuker”?"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"Oh, do you require more time with the facilities? By all means, take as long as you like! And if you require additional materials, let me know. I have plenty here for the “featherless neuker.”"},{"name":"DAMETTA","text":"Is that the finished product? I...I have no idea what that is, but it looks splendid! I'm sure your client will love it! Ah─it so happens there was another note in the bag: “Retain spare parts, in case featherless neuker loses component en route.” He really doesn't trust you, does he?"},{"name":"YAZELAHUATAN","text":"Feathered, my precious posterior yet is, but not for long if featherless <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">craftswoman</span><span class=\"alternative\">craftsman</span></span> does not deliver bladder lining component!"},{"name":"YAZELAHUATAN","text":"Squa-hawk! A gift to the Ehcatl, your craftsmanship is, and a gift to Ixali maidens, Yazel remains! Ah─ Squahaha! Naught more than jest, my words are, of course. Never would Methuli harm his tailfeathers, Yazel knows."},{"name":"YAZELAHUATAN","text":"(A buzzard to be feared, the Hard is.
