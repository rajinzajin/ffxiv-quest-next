First, place the four umbles before the withered treant.","Having placed the umbles, next set down the two fragrant flowers.","The offerings placed, proceed to /kneel in deference to this once-proud guardian of the forest.","You have paid respect to the withered treant as instructed. Return to Buscarron's Druthers and let Ianna know that the custom has been observed.","Ianna explains that the people of her region revere the treants as forest guardians, and look to them to protect the balance of life in the Twelveswood─a task made at once more needful and more difficult by the changes set in motion during the Calamity. With the piteous image of the withered treant still fresh in your mind, however, you cannot help wondering if the ancient creatures might not require protection of their own."],"objectives":["Gather piles of antelope umbles.","Gather kedtrap petals.","Place the antelope umbles before the withered treant.","Place the kedtrap petals before the withered treant.","/kneel in respect to the withered treant.","Speak with Ianna at Buscarron's Druthers."],"dialogue":[{"name":"IANNA","text":"This tavern is sheltered by the Shroud, imparting a sense of peace and tranquility to all within.
