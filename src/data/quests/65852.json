There have been reports of a sizable creature roaming the outskirts of Aleport in western La Noscea."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"This monster is no Kujata, but the threat it presents to the locals is nonetheless sufficient to warrant our attention. It should also prove a worthy foe to test your burgeoning prowess."},{"name":"WYRNZOEN","text":"How to find this beast?
