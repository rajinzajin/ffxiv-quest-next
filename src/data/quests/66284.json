For want of a better lead, perhaps you should speak with Hihibaru once again.","Hihibaru suspects that someone may be inciting the beast tribes.

But thanks to the nigh-endless beastman raids, folk are too afraid to come within a malm of here."},{"name":"HIHIBARU","text":"I sold everything I owned to get my venture started, and I'm loath to give up without making an earnest effort to stick it out. But if things keep going as they are, I'll be bankrupt before the moon is through..."},{"name":"HIHIBARU","text":"Whining won't do me any good, though. No, for my business to survive, I need <span class=\"emphasis\">business</span>. Speaking of which, perhaps you'd like to browse my wares!

Cut my losses before they drag me all the way down..."},{"name":"NPCC","text":"Aye, I've heard tell of the masked devil. Seems he's been appearing not only around Highbridge, but elsewhere about Thanalan, too."},{"name":"NPCC","text":"Enough folk have reported seeing him to convince me he's more than a figment of the imagination, but little is known about him otherwise."},{"name":"HIHIBARU","text":"Judging by your expression, I take it you didn't learn much of use."},{"name":"HIHIBARU","text":"Look, I'm sorry for my rudeness earlier. It's just that things are tough for us merchants at the moment. The Qiqirn raids are so constant, so organized, we're beginning to suspect that someone is orchestrating it all."},{"name":"HIHIBARU","text":"I tend to put my own welfare first, like most of us do, but that doesn't mean I'm a bad person.
