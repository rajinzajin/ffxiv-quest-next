I mean, if they were easy to beat, they wouldn't be worth taking back to Doma, would they?"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"How confident and bold in speech he has grown. More and more he reminds me of his father in his youth..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Although I have spent much time with the Mol, I have yet to fully grasp the nature of the udgan and their insights."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"That they value the chance encounter, and the potential fortune it brings, however, is plain. Let us try not to disappoint them!"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"My friends. I must warn you. The path upon which you embark is fraught with peril."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"You will journey unto the far reaches of the Steppe to confront a terrible foe, as did the warrior Bardam in days of yore. Three days he battled with the demon ere he returned to his people. So it is written, so must it be."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Many who follow in his footsteps perish, lacking in strength of body and mind. Therefore..."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"We must treat you to a great feast!"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Have...have I said something strange? The hungry fox starves staring at the bull's testicles, therefore warriors should be well fed on the eve of battle!"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"She does have a point. You have been keeping busy in my absence. A brief repast may be in order, lest we collapse of fatigue and malnourishment in the midst of our trial."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Yes, just so! However, it will take time to prepare."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Is there anything we can do to help? It might also give us a chance to learn more about your people and their ways."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Well, if you insist, I am sure that the others would be glad of your assistance."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Hmm... Would you go and speak with Dorbei, Lyse?"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"As for you three─you can help me with another task."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"For today's feast the gods decreed that we lure gulo gulo to slaughter with entrails. Perhaps you could be the ones to do this?"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"That your people look to the gods for guidance I understand, but in your daily meals! I say, your grandmother must be quite busy."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Some days more than others. But every night we come together around the cookfire."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Even babes must earn their keep on the Steppe. Give over the entrails, Cirina. We will bring you a bounty of meat!"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Hien has the entrails. Good hunting, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Shall the gulo gulo be so easily lured to the slaughter, I wonder..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"A word of advice. Our quarry is wont to avoid the Xaela and their settlements, but is fond of flowing waters..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Hmm. A thought occurs to me. How about we make a game of it, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"I have six bags of entrails with which we may lure our gulo gulo. Three for you, and three for me."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Whoever returns with the greater portion shall be declared the winner. What say you?"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Then it is settled! Gosetsu will stand as witness. Let the game begin!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"The rules are simple. Whoever returns with the greater portion shall be declared the winner."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"You have but a limited quantity of bait. Use it wisely, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Seek places far from men and near water."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Use the entrails to erect a lure here?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This area appears to be isolated and far from any Xaela settlement. There may be many gulo gulo lurking nearby..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The river winds its way south, the waters churning with the gentle current. There may be many gulo gulo lurking nearby..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This area appears to be isolated and far from any Xaela settlement. There may be many gulo gulo lurking nearby..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Hoofprints and wagon tracks are unmistakable in the earth. Perhaps there are gulo gulo lurking nearby..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The watchtowers of Mol Iloh are still visible in the distance. It seems unlikely that gulo gulo would venture this close..."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Oh, have you used all your bait? In that case, let us see the fruits of your labor!"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Ho! It would seem that, at the very least, you are the <span class=\"emphasis\">faster</span> hunter."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"But speed is not everything. For my part, I slew six gulo gulo!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Aye, that you have, my lord. As for <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>..."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"The meat of eight gulo gulo did <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> bring! A fine day's work, and undeniably the greater portion."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"The meat of seven gulo gulo did <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> bring! By a slim margin did <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> best you, but victory is <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">hers</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> all the same."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Six gulo gulo did <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> slay too! 'Twould seem you have met your match, my lord."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"The meat of five was all <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> could muster. The day is yours, my lord─but only by a touch."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"With the meat of four did <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> return. Congratulations, my lord─you are the victor!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"This day you are twice the hunter as <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span>, for our friend delivered unto me but three portions─half your sum, my lord."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"...My lord, I do not wish to alarm you, but the bounty of meat <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> has brought far outstrips yours! Impossibly so..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Bah! A loss, is it? And how confident I was in my chances."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Nevertheless, it is a testament to your skills as a hunter and a warrior. How fortunate I am to count one so talented among my allies!"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Hah hah hah! Of all the possible outcomes, this is perhaps the most amusing."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"And perhaps the most auspicious. Though I would have preferred to win the day, I shall settle for the whimsy of the kami."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Oho! And there you have it. I shall try not to let it go to my head."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"I know better than to expect the hawk to show <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> talons on a whim. Nay, when the time comes, I expect you will prove yourself more than my match."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"And with that, our game is concluded. Let us return to Mol Iloh forthwith─and let us have <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> present our meat to Cirina."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Mayhap you are unfamiliar with traditional Xaela cuisine? Let not its appearance deceive you─it is quite hearty and nourishing."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Were it not so, I doubt they could have nursed me back to health. Heh heh, you should have seen the state I was in..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"She should be impressed when she sees the quantity we have brought."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Such kindness and generosity they have shown not only my lord, but us all. Victory in the Naadam will be a fitting repayment!"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"You are returned, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. How was your hunt?"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"My word, this is impressive! Or were you so hungry that you felt the need to kill so many?"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Well! I shall endeavor not to disappoint you all with my cooking!"}],"reward":{"gil":717,"items":[{"id":18353,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18356,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18357,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18359,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5683,"one":1}],"xp":207900},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":65,"id":142}],"quests":[68039]},"next":[68041,68304,68305,68306]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1020501","obj":{"i":1020501,"n":"Cirina","l":2411,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020544","obj":{"i":1020544,"n":"Hien","l":2411,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020545","obj":{"i":1020545,"n":"Lyse","l":2411,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020546","obj":{"i":1020546,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2411,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020547","obj":{"i":1020547,"n":"Gosetsu","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020548","obj":{"i":1020548,"n":"Hien","l":2411,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"18353","obj":{"i":18353,"n":"Pine Cane","l":273,"c":32714,"t":9,"p":38916}},{"type":"item","id":"18356","obj":{"i":18356,"n":"Tigerskin Codex","l":273,"c":33583,"t":98,"p":38916}},{"type":"item","id":"18357","obj":{"i":18357,"n":"Durium Astrometer","l":273,"c":34885,"t":89,"p":38916}},{"type":"item","id":"18359","obj":{"i":18359,"n":"Durium Smallsword","l":273,"c":36721,"t":97,"p":38916}},{"type":"item","id":"5683","obj":{"i":5683,"n":"Battledance Materia V","l":160,"c":20256,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Tenacity","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68039","obj":{"i":68039,"n":"Stars in the Dark","g":6,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":610}},{"type":"quest","id":"68041","obj":{"i":68041,"n":"The Heart of Nations","g":6,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":630}},{"type":"quest","id":"68304","obj":{"i":68304,"n":"Keeping the Faith","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":5170}},{"type":"quest","id":"68305","obj":{"i":68305,"n":"Tent That Rocked","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":5180}},{"type":"quest","id":"68306","obj":{"i":68306,"n":"Sacred Sweeping","g":110,"l":"The Azim Steppe","s":5190}}]}
