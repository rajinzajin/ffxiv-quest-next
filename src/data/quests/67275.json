In her old age, however, their delivery proves more difficult than she would care to admit. Determined to see her hard work is not wasted, she asks you to distribute three sets of packed meals in her stead. Pick up the packed meals and prepare to make your delivery.","You pick up the three sets of packed meals. See them safely to the knights of Camp Cloudtop.","You have delivered all of the packed meals, garnering you many thanks for temporarily relieving the resident cook of her duties. Head back and speak with the Rose Knight cook.","Though she lacks the vigor to jump for joy, her look of gratitude is unmistakable as she conveys the pleasure she takes in preparing their meals. Though the thinner air of the Sea of Clouds is harsh in her old age, she assures you a meal cooked by their hands is equally unkind, vowing to continue to work so long as she is able."],"objectives":["Pick up the packed meals for delivery.","Deliver the packed meals.","Report to the Rose Knight cook."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LUNCHCLERK01739","text":"Hello there, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">missy</span><span class=\"alternative\">laddie</span></span>.
