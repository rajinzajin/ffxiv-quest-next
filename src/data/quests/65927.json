The tasks she has in mind for you, however, will keep you close to Revenant's Toll. In addition to recruiting volunteers from among the adventuring population, the Antecedent wishes you to consult with Slafborn regarding the town's state of readiness. Speak first with Tataru, and invite the receptionist to join you and the Adventurers' Guild representative in discussing the troubles that might spill over the border from the conflict in Coerthas.","You explain Minfilia's request to Tataru, who immediately begins to plan for every possible eventuality. Follow in the enterprising young receptionist's wake, and join her in consulting with Slafborn.","Though Slafborn readily acknowledges the importance of elevating the Toll's state of readiness, he is unwilling to make any formal commitment to assist in the coming conflict. Consult with Tataru regarding the possibility of approaching adventurers directly.","Tataru seems more than happy to recruit volunteers face-to-face. Speak with the adventurers in Revenant's Toll and attempt to rally them to Ishgard's cause.","You have approached a number of adventurers, and been greeted with responses ranging from cautious interest to barely concealed hostility. After being rebuffed by a particularly reluctant Roegadyn, you are suddenly pulled aside by Riol, who proceeds to explain the suspicious circumstances surrounding the disappearance of Wilred, the youth from Little Ala Mhigo. With battle looming on the horizon, however, there is little time for you to delve into this latest mystery. Return to Tataru and inform her of the results of your recruiting efforts.","You compare notes with Tataru, and are pleased to find that her recruitment efforts have met with similar results. Should those who expressed an interest be true to their word, the forces of Ishgard will soon be bolstered by a small-but-experienced contingent of adventurers..."],"objectives":["Speak with Tataru.","Speak with Slafborn in Revenant's Toll.","Speak with Tataru.","Recruit adventurers in Revenant's Toll.","Speak with Tataru."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"I have bid the Archons travel to their assigned nations."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Should the members of the Alliance agree to pledge Grand Company soldiers to Ishgard's cause, our comrades will be on hand to act as intermediaries for the duration of the conflict."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"...The small matter of persuading the Alliance leaders to <span class=\"emphasis\">grant</span> such support I leave to Alphinaud."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"For you, my friend, a different task awaits: I would have you reach out to your fellow adventurers, and gather what allies you may for the coming siege."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"I would also have you consider the matter of our own security. Revenant's Toll is but a short flight from the snowfields of Coerthas─it is not unimaginable that the fighting may spill across the border."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Pray brief Slafborn on the brewing conflict, and discuss potential contingencies. The frontier settlers must be prepared for aught that might wing its way over our walls."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"I only hope that such precautions prove unnecessary...<br>Ah, before you leave─might I suggest that you have Tataru accompany you?

If war is coming to Coerthas, then the Toll must be made ready."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"I'll increase the number of patrols and lookouts immediately. I'll also see about finding room for an infirmary, as well as temporary housing for victims of the conflict. Ishgard has done well by us in the past and I would return the favor."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"But as for rounding up volunteers for the fighting itself, I'm afraid I must disappoint you. I will not send my fellow guild members to die on Ishgardian soil, and I am certain headquarters will say the same."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"There will be no official Adventurers' Guild presence at this siege. That said...each adventurer is of course free to do as he or she will.

I daresay there are a few stout souls about town who will answer your call to arms."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"I'll see if I can't persuade a few friends to join the cause. While I do that, why not try asking around for volunteers here in the Toll? I daresay you'll find a few who are willing to help. But do make sure they're up to the task, will you? You want to fight the dragons, not feed them."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Let's get started, shall we? We have a town to rouse!"},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Attention, adventurers!

Would that I had quit the stifling confines of my homeland sooner..."},{"name":"ADVENTURERC00391","text":"Revenant's Toll continues to grow, as does the number of travelers who pass through its gates. Between you and me, I'm having a hard time keeping an eye on them all."},{"name":"ADVENTURERD00391","text":"Adventuring is, by its nature, an unpredictable business. With planning and preparation, you can mitigate <span class=\"emphasis\">some</span> of the risks...but if you don't trust your instincts, you won't last long."},{"name":"ADVENTURERA00391","text":"Sell me blade to the Ishgardians?

I think not."},{"name":"ADVENTURERB00391","text":"Dragons claimed the lives of every one of my brothers─I do not mean to offer them mine.
