While the sight of the young birds setting out on the first leg of their life's long journey is soothing to the soul, the decomposing piles of leaf litter and broken eggshells they leave behind are less welcome. The moogle asks you to scour the heights of Zenith for the fledglings' abandoned nests and bring them back to him.","You clear away the empty wildfowl nests, leaving the heights of Zenith spick-and-span and ready for the birds' return. Descend from Zenith and deliver the nests to the unmaneuvering moogle.","The moogle thanks you for clearing away the nests and lets you in on a little secretâ”€he has heard rumors that birds' nests can be used to make a delicious soup, and plans to use those you have collected to test the recipe.
