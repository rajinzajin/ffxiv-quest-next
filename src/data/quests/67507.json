However, flat-footed opkens lurk near the area and prey upon his kind. Lie in wait at the specified locations and slay three of the creatures, that Saro Roggo need not live in fear.","You have eliminated the opkens. Take word of your success back to Saro Roggo.","Saro Roggo thanks you for making his past and future home safe again. But in spite of his apparent resignation, it is painfully obvious that he is not ready to give up. Use your powers of deduction to ascertain what he desires of you, and perform the appropriate action for him.","Your boisterous cheering has the desired effect, and Saro Roggo regains his determination to please his mistress. He declares that he will ask after her desires directly...right after you soften her up for him.","Following your lead, Saro Roggo approaches his mistress, and begs to know her desires. To his disappointment, however, she replies that she has none, explaining that she is but an old woman awaiting her death. Moved by his devotion, Matoya entrusts to Saro Roggo the task of closing her Crystal Eye when she dies, and then laying the serendipitous broom at her side. You may rest assured in the knowledge that Saro Roggo has finally found a purpose for his existence."],"objectives":["Lie in wait outside Matoya's Cave and defeat flat-footed opkens.","Report to Saro Roggo in Matoya's Cave.","Perform the appropriate action for Saro Roggo.","Speak with Matoya."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Should you choose to undertake this quest, you will receive no guidance from the journal or the duty list.
