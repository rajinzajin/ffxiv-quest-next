For that reason, he wishes to return to her a package he believes she left behind by accident during her last visit. Deliver the package as bade and see if Ser Ysaudore recognizes it.","Torn between decorum and her desire to do right by the hardworking mason, Ser Ysaudore deliberately left behind the package of extra rations, believing that Thierremont would understand her gesture. Alas, he did not, and now the food has gone to waste. As there is nothing to be done, return to Falcon's Nest and report to Ser Redwald.","Tales of your various deeds have reached Ser Redwald's ears, giving him cause to applaud your initiative. However, he has not the time to thank you properly, as a sudden development has him scrambling to dispatch every able-bodied man and woman."],"objectives":["Deliver the ice-crusted bundle to Ysaudore at the Anvil.","Report to Redwald."],"dialogue":[{"name":"THIERREMONT","text":"Are you for Falcon's Nest?
