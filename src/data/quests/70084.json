{"quest":{"name":"Defiant Ogul, Deified!","location":"Thavnair","id":70084,"patch":6.15,"sort":4,"icon":101173,"beast":15,"unlocksFunction":1,"eventIcon":71341,"issuer":1042300,"target":1042300,"genre":32,"journal":["Perhaps it is simply your imagination, but Svarna's working population feels notably bigger. The glint in Trna's eye suggests she'll be happy to explain.<br>※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level.","Thanks to their improved living conditions, Svarna's hippos are more energetic than ever, and business for the Riders is booming. Trna is informing you that would-be workers have gathered in hopes of hippo-based employment when Ogul arrives before you in a state of distress─and odd dress. She claims that a Gajasura calling himself “Acala” has injured a Rider and stolen a hippo cart, so Trna asks both you and Ogul to accompany her to the Shroud of the Samgha in hopes of evening the score with this hippo-stealing bandit.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Ogul leads you to the spot she encountered him, but Acala is nowhere to be found. Still, danger seems to lurk just out of sight, so you part ways with Trna and Ogul to scout the area for enemies.","You both confirm and trounce the Gajasura presence in the area. Knowing Acala can't be far behind, you rendezvous with the others to warn them.","Acala has beaten you to your comrades, but thankfully both Trna and Ogul seem unharmed. With halting speech, Acala proclaims that he has come to conquer Thavnair. Such a show of strength, he claims, will both prove his worth to the tribe that rejected him, and grant his compatriots sanctuary. While rebuking his threats, Trna seems moved by his plight, seeing in this stranger vestiges of her past self. Acala, in turn, awkwardly praises the Hippo Riders and swears he will one day take Svarna for his people. Before Trna can object, Acala rides off on the stolen hippo cart, leaving her in equal parts frustration and uncertainty.","You review the information at hand, but this Gajasura dilemma is too complicated to parse out in the jungle. You regroup in Svarna to talk strategy.","What to do about Acala is a question not likely to be answered overnight, but his surprising talent with a hippo cart awakens Trna to the possibility that anyone could learn to ride if given the chance. Trna has Maru open a meyhane on the premises, in hopes of recruiting adventurers and strengthening security in Svarna. With more people than ever milling about, the atmosphere is optimistic even as inevitable conflict with Acala looms in the distance... "],"objectives":["Speak with Ogul at the Shroud of the Samgha.","Survey the area and defeat any enemies that may appear.","Rendezvous with Ogul and Trna.","Speak with Ogul.","Speak with Trna in Svarna."],"dialogue":[{"name":"TRNA","text":"Nice to see you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. If you've a moment, I'll tell you the latest."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Thanks to our cool an' breezy stables, our hippos have been gettin' all sorts of luxurious shut-eye─an' the little 'pots can't be tempted away from their splashin'. All in all, our growin' family's burstin' with energy."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Good thing too, seein' as our services are in ever-higher demand. Folks have even started comin' around an' petitionin' for employment, if you can believe it!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"We've always liked keepin' our business to ourselves, so the thought of welcomin' in strangers felt dreadfully queer at first. But helpin' others is what Riders do, so we've got some new faces on the team."},{"name":"MARU","text":"Besides, as swamped in requests as we are, we'd be lost without the extra help..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"(-???-)Help! Help, I say!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I appreciate the enthusiastic chorus, Ogul─but what've you gone an' done to your head?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"...Lose a bet, perchance? "},{"name":"A1","text":"Ogul, you look fantastic!"},{"name":"A1","text":"Excuse me, have we met?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"This is hardly the time for jesting! We are in crisis, I tell you. Crisis! There are Gajasura in the jungle!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Ever since you mentioned that thieving Matanga, I've had this terrible suspicion. I had to know for certain, so I cleverly camouflaged myself with this gaja disguise and set out to investigate."},{"name":"MARU","text":"That's...a disguise? An' ain't you sweatin' an awful lot?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I would choose a pool of sweat over a pool of blood any day! Between the Au Ra and Gajasura, there can be naught but violence and requital."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"And there is no doubt as to what I witnessed─a Gajasura in the flesh!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"The image of it shall haunt my dreams─those red eyes...that devilish armor...that cart drawn by a frothing hippo!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Wha─? A hippo cart!?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"He declared his name with a ghastly voice─Acala. I became an edifice of fear. He asked if I was his Matanga brethren!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"In that moment, all I could envision was my own death and dismemberment by that beastly creature. Before I knew what had happened, I heard my own voice cry out:"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"“Not I! I am but a passing Manusya!”"},{"name":"MARU","text":"Manusya <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> have bodies of men and heads of beasts, so if you squint...<span class=\"emphasis\">really</span> hard... Never mind, ain't no way anyone'd buy that."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Actually, he was terribly polite about it. Pressed his hands together and bowed deeply before leaving me be."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"You're sayin' you let him go? Ain't no doubt he's the bandit we're lookin' for! You're a fighter, ain't you!?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I-I'm sorry. While I have come to cherish the Arkasodara as my friends and allies, Gajasura...are another matter entirely."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"When I came to my senses, I searched the area and found one of your associates injured and missing his cart─no doubt the same cart now in Acala's possession. Luckily, your man's injuries seemed manageable, so I saw him to Palaka's Stand, where Yezahn is treating him now."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Is that so? Then I owe you my thanks. Sorry for losin' my temper like that─everyone's entitled to their weaknesses."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Anyhow, even if he did give us leg bail, he can't've gone far! I say we track him down while the trail's hot an' take back what's ours."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Then let us reconvene at the Shroud of the Samgha. I shall take you to the very place I encountered him!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Saurya's in Svarna with the others. I won't be responsible for my actions if she gets taken too."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I've left Maru in charge, but if this Acala character really <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> Gajasura, I'd like to get back sooner rather than later."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"This is where I saw him. From here, he rode off on that stolen hippo cart...but I can't for the life of me remember which direction he went."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I was so paralyzed by fear that north could have been south and east, west. To let a phobia get the better of me like this... Can I really call myself an adventurer?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"There ain't much use cryin' over spilt chai. You were caught by surprise, end of story. We should stay grounded and focus on what we know."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Grounded...of course! That's it! "},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Grandmother would often say that the trail to prey begins at a hunter's feet."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"And look here! On the ground, beneath our feet─wheel tracks! Departing in a southwesterly fashion."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I say we divide our efforts to preclude any Gajasura trickery. I shall accompany Trna as her guard, while <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you survey the area for hidden villainy. I'm counting on you!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Sweeping your gaze across the area, you see no trace of Gajasura─hidden, villainous, or otherwise."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You listen closely to the sounds around you: the faint rustling of wind through leaves, the snuffling of wild beasts. No hippo carts."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I thought I heard fightin'. You okay?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Looks like we've finally found our man. His eyes really <span class=\"emphasis\">are</span> red..."},{"name":"ACALA","text":"Heard fighting! You hurt battle brothers!?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Ghhhnnn... M-M-My M-Matanga t-tolerance won't be d-defeated by the l-likes of you!"},{"name":"ACALA","text":"Why no fire? Thavnair full of fire, Acala hear, good for conquest..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I ain't got the foggiest idea what delusions you're ridin' in on, but I'll tell you one thing─you're pickin' a fight with the wrong island. You'd best give back what you took an' skip along home."},{"name":"ACALA","text":"No! Not leave till conquest Thavnair! Small Gajasura, shame to tribe─no place for Acala and battle brothers!"},{"name":"ACALA","text":"Travel far to prove strength, protect brothers! Conquest Thavnair, home for brothers!"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"We won't stand by and let you conquer Thavnair."},{"name":"A2","text":"Can't we settle this peacefully?"},{"name":"ACALA","text":"You silence! Acala no fight today. Battle brothers must eat medicine."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I see your reasonin', but you ain't got no right to involve my hippo. Let him go. <span class=\"emphasis\">Now</span>!"},{"name":"ACALA","text":"Your food, good taste. Wagon, good ride. Good for battle brothers. Soon, your home conquest for Acala! Remember!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Hey! Get back here, you─ Argh! What kinda person compliments your cookin' before ridin' off with hostages!? "},{"name":"OGUL","text":"H-He's gone. I-If hippo carts weren't so fast, w-we could have given chase..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"...He said somethin' about bein' small, but he didn't seem much different than us Arkasodara. Are other Gajasura seriously massive or somethin'?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Oh, about twice as big as your average Arkasodara! It is even said that their leader, the grand regent, is indeed so grand that to gaze upon their full stature is to break your neck looking upwards!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"In comparison, Acala seemed quite modestly sized. Were his compatriots similar?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I see, only slightly bigger, then... Still, they must be considered quite small by their other brethren."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"He said they had no place to go. Can't say I don't know how that feels..."},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"But can you forgive what he's done?"},{"name":"A3","text":"He didn't seem very open to negotiations..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I know, I know. But keepin' his brothers safe came before anythin', didn't it? Hard to damn him for that."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Gettin' pushed out of society just for bein' who you are can really work you woe. Makes you wonder if you were ever worth anythin' to begin with. No wonder he's itchin' to prove himself..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"On the Azim Steppe, the very notion that Gajasura could be capable of such nuanced emotions is─pardon me for saying so─preposterous. "},{"name":"OGUL","text":"However, judging a book by its cover does nothing but feed fear and misunderstanding. This is something I certainly learned thanks to my experiences in Thavnair."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"You've gotta judge others by their actions. Of course, so far Acala's mostly injured my associate, stolen my property, and kidnapped my hippo, but still..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Back in Vanaspati, we lived in a small village pretty cut off from the rest of the island. People had their opinions of you, an' it was no easy thing changin' anyone's mind."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I remember buttin' heads with the other villagers to an' again over how they treated us. Even made plans to leave town without a hippo to my name, once. So, I think I might know how Acala's feelin', if only a little..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Now, let us brace ourselves with some adventuring fundamentals─review of the information at hand."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"The bandit responsible for the assault of a Hippo Rider, theft of personal property, and kidnapping of an innocent hippo is a Gajasura called “Acala.” According to him, he and his compatriots are here to conquer Thavnair, so as to prove themselves to their fellows and secure a home of their own."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Acala also seems to have taken a fancy to our carts─which means he's got good taste─but it also means that Svarna's high on his list to conquer."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"If I rallied my people an' had you two there to back us up, we could probably put down Acala and his crew, full stop. But I'd rather it not come to blows."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I'm not goin' soft or nothin', but causin' a hurly-burly don't exactly right any wrongs. I wanna talk with the others an' see if we can't figure out a way to do this civilly."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Settling matters peacefully should also put you on the right side of the Radiant Host. I shall be sure to relay your plight to them in a most sympathetic fashion."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Now I shall away to Palaka's Stand to check in on your ailing associate. Once he feels well enough to travel, I will send him along."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I'd like your input on our strategy. I'll head back to Svarna first to round up the others."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Now, about that bandit..."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"Not only does he biff an innocent courier, he vanishes with our hippo!? When I'm through turnin' that scamp into paste, he'll wish he were turmeric..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Normally, I'd hand you the pestle with pleasure, Ghasa. But things ain't so simple. After all, in another lifetime, us and Acala might've been brothers."},{"name":"MARU","text":"I agree with the boss... Don't feel right pushin' around someone who's been through the same thing we have... "},{"name":"GHASA","text":"Still! Knowin' that bastard swindled his way into our sweet hippo's heart is bringin' me to tears faster than Maru and his damned onions! Since when do our hippos trust the likes of Gajasura anyway!?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Well, with so many jobs takin' us hither an' yon, our hippos've gotten used to all sorts of different folk. Even Acala's just one in a crowd."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Makes you think─if he can learn to ride a cart, anyone can."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"...Anyone and <span class=\"emphasis\">everyone</span>, I should say. An' why not?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"We gather people here like you an' Ogul─y'know, adventurers─and when a job comes in, we send 'em out on their own hippo carts."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Havin' a crew of strong arms hangin' around the place gives us the advantage, just in case Acala ever decides to pay us a visit."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"But they don't all have to be brawlers, neither. Say we've got some alchemists─we could send 'em anywhere on the island to take care of injuries. The right deed for any need, sort of a thing."},{"name":"Q4","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A4","text":"Opening an Adventurers' Guild, are we?"},{"name":"A4","text":"There will be refreshments, I trust?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Why not? Stop by, have a drink, hear what work's available. I think I'm on to somethin' here, if I do say so myself."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"If I can get a linkpearl connection goin' with Kancana, that'd be even better. We could give each other moment-to-moment updates."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Maru! We've got a kitchen, so how hard could a meyhane be, eh? Get me a meyhane, Maru!"},{"name":"MARU","text":"M-Meyhane! You got it, Boss─I'll get a meyhane runnin' in the twinklin' of a hippo's eye!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Thanks to the efforts of Maru and the others, Svarna has a new meyhane!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The Hippo Riders are now trustworthy couriers of some repute.
