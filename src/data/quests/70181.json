Nevertheless, it successfully directs you to await Tataru's arrival at the islet inlet.","To your surprise, Tataru arrives with Grand Storm Marshal Eynzahr and the infamous former captain of the Bloody Executioners, Hyllfyr, in tow. Your conversation with them leaves you with the distinct impression that talk of island sanctuaries may soon spread amongst the erstwhile pirates of the Rhotano Sea. For now, however, with the isle all to yourself once again, you may forget about the outside world for a while."],"objectives":["Await Tataru's arrival at the designated location."],"dialogue":[{"name":"OPERATORMAMMET","text":"Contact!

I hope you don't mind."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"(-Familiar Roegadyn-)I heard from the Admiral that you landed a permit for an island sanctuary, so I thought I would stop by and offer my support.
