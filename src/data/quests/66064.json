In order to facilitate your journey, he bestows upon you an airship pass, which will allow you to travel by air between the three allied nations. Before making your way to the airship landing, be sure to quiz Momodi as to what awaits beyond the deserts of Thanalan.","In addition to Ul'dah, the Eorzean Alliance encompasses the city–states of Gridania and Limsa Lominsa. Once you have made your final preparations for the journey, take the Wellhead Lift to the airship landing and speak with Elyenora at the entrance lobby.","You are now ready to embark upon the first leg of your journey, which will take you to Limsa Lominsa. Make your way to the landing area and await departure.","Having safely arrived in Limsa Lominsa, you must now seek an audience with the Admiral. Ask the storm honor guard for assistance.","The Admiral awaits you in her command room on the Bridge. Take the Crow's Lift to Bulwark Hall, and present Raubahn's missive to Zanthael before the Admiral's Lift to gain admission.","Admiral Bloefhiswyn is receptive to the proposal detailed in Raubahn's missive. It appears the Garlean Empire still poses a grave threat to Eorzea, with the XIVth Imperial Legion, led by Legatus Gaius van Baelsar, deeply entrenched in the border regions. Your business in Limsa Lominsa successfully concluded, make your way to the airship landing and speak with L'nophlo.","You are now ready to embark upon the second leg of your journey, which will take you to Gridania. Make your way to the landing area and await departure.","Having safely arrived in Gridania, you must now seek an audience with the Elder Seedseer. Ask the serpent honor guard for assistance.","The Elder Seedseer awaits you at the Lotus Stand. Make your way to Nophica's Altar within Old Gridania, and present Raubahn's missive to the silent conjurer to gain admission.","Having now passed on Raubahn's message to the leaders of both Limsa Lominsa and Gridania, you have discharged your duty as the Flame General's envoy, and learned of the various threats facing Eorzea in the process. Given the immensity of the forces at work, you are moved to wonder what meaningful contribution a lone adventurer might make to the realm's preservation. Perhaps the answer will be revealed to you in the days to come."],"objectives":["Speak with Momodi.","Speak with Elyenora at the airship landing.","Board the airship.","Speak with the storm honor guard.","Present Raubahn's missive to Zanthael at Bulwark Hall.","Speak with L'nophlo at the airship landing.","Board the airship.","Speak with the serpent honor guard.","Present Raubahn's missive to the silent conjurer at Nophica's Altar."],"dialogue":[{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Listen well, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

However, its innovations in the field of magitek, some fifty years past, helped to raise it from the depths of obscurity."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Emboldened by this technology, it set about subjugating its neighbors, swiftly absorbing each into its ever-expanding territory. And when all of Ilsabard lay within its grasp, it turned its ravenous gaze upon Eorzea."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Yet Garlemald's transformation did not come about by virtue of magitek alone.

This would explain the Empire's relative inactivity in recent years, which has granted us much-needed time to rebuild."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Yet we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent, for Garlemald still maintains a presence in Eorzea, in the form of the XIVth Imperial Legion."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Commanding this great host is Legatus Gaius van Baelsar, a man whose ambitions are well known to us. So long as he breathes Eorzean air, none of us may sleep easy."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"The Calamity wreaked such devastation upon the realm that it has been all we could do to nurse our wounds, never mind rebuild our defenses. Simply put, we have not the strength to repel the Empire."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"To add to our woes, the beast tribes continue to summon their primals, whose very existence is a bane upon the land."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Each nation is beset with its own primal problem; none has the resources to look beyond its own borders."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"The Admiral desires my counsel regarding a brazen wolf."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"She means to tell me that the Empire may soon resume its advance."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Though the primals pose an undeniable threat to our survival, the threat posed by the Garleans is greater still. Clearly, each nation can no longer afford to think only of that which occurs within its own borders."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"A storm gathers upon the horizon. If we are to weather it, we must needs stand united once more. A remembrance service may help to rekindle the spirit of unity which brought the peoples of Eorzea together when last the Empire threatened our liberty."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"The Flame General was wise to make his proposal, and I wholeheartedly approve of it.
