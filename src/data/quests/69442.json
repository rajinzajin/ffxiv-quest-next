We've been experimenting with a few different designs, but judging from the screeching some have been making, it seems like they're not up to the task."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"I reckon we could use your help in crafting a solution to this pressing matter, considering your knack for handiwork. 'Course, reputation only counts for so much, so I trust you'll give the parts a thorough testing before we put them to use."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Shigitt's the one in charge of the supplies, and it's him that'll fill you in on what we need. Off you go, now."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Ah, come to help with my tests, have you? Very good─the results of these trials could prove paramount to the further development of our tanks."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Of course, considering their size, it would be folly to test the parts on the tanks straightaway. That's why we'll be using automata for now. Much safer─a malfunctioning automaton never hurt anyone...as far as I know."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Now then, take these and work your magic to make three of my new load-bearing mechanisms. If you misplace or otherwise find yourself in need of more parts, you can always get more from Ronitt's automaton."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Now then, take these and work your magic to make three of my new load-bearing mechanisms. If you misplace or otherwise find yourself in need of more parts, you can always get more from Ronitt's automaton."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Now then, take these and work your magic to make three measures of my specialized oil─it should make those wheels as quiet as a cat's footsteps. If you misplace or otherwise find yourself in need of more parts, you can always get more from Ronitt's automaton."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Once you're finished, give the parts to my workers in Weathering and you can commence with the testing. I await positive results, and failing that, enlightening ones!"},{"name":"AUTOMATON03906","text":"&lt;beep&gt; Materials detected. Request denied."},{"name":"AUTOMATON03906","text":"&lt;beep&gt; Materials detected. Request denied."},{"name":"AUTOMATON03906","text":"&lt;beep&gt; Ingredients detected.

Good, good. Now let's just stick them right in here..."},{"name":"DAILYDWARF03906","text":"Gah, this way?<br>...Ah, this way!"},{"name":"SYSTEM03906","text":"Without making a sound, the automaton zooms off at full speed until it becomes a speck on the horizon."},{"name":"DAILYDWARF03906","text":"Well, off it goes! But did you hear that? Or should I say, did you not hear that? I daresay it wouldn't wake a baby. Well done, well done!"},{"name":"DAILYDWARF03906","text":"And now─<br>Oh, where'd it go!? I'd better find it before it falls off a cliff, or worse─automata don't exactly grow on trees! In the meantime, tell Regitt that the parts should be ready for use. "},{"name":"DAILYDWARF03906","text":"Was it this way...?"},{"name":"SYSTEM03906","text":"The automaton starts with a jolt, and without making a sound, zooms off into the distance at a frightening speed."},{"name":"DAILYDWARF03906","text":"Would you look at that! Not a squeak! Something seems to be wrong with the speed-limiting mechanism, but that's hardly a fault of yours. Perhaps I might call on your expert counsel later to address this new issue."},{"name":"DAILYDWARF03906","text":"Now, where did it go...? I'd best send someone to find it before it crashes into some poor, unsuspecting soul. You go and tell Regitt the parts you made are in perfect working order."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Welcome back! I can tell by the grease on your hands that you've been hard at work. And judging by the smile on your face, I reckon the tests were a rousing success!"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"For the good of the Anvil, we must continue developing and testing ever more complex parts. Then one day, we'll have a fleet of tanks that are silent not because they're broken down, but because they've been so masterfully built!"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Of course, even the most well-designed machines still need regular maintenance, but building them properly in the first place is half the battle. I sense many more tests are in store for us both!"}],"reward":{"gil":679,"reputation":60,"items":[{"id":28188},{"num":25,"id":10},{"id":28188},{"num":25,"id":8},{"id":28188},{"num":25,"id":9},{"id":28188},{"num":25,"id":10},{"id":28188},{"num":25,"id":11},{"id":28188},{"num":25,"id":12},{"id":28188},{"num":25,"id":13},{"id":28188},{"num":25,"id":8}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":3,"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":33}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1033712","obj":{"i":1033712,"n":"Regitt","l":2953,"q":28}},{"type":"item","id":"28188","obj":{"i":28188,"n":"Hammered Frogment","l":1,"c":65080,"t":100}},{"type":"item","id":"31152","obj":{"i":31152,"n":"Axle Component Materials","l":1,"c":25919,"t":61}},{"type":"item","id":"31153","obj":{"i":31153,"n":"Axle Component","l":290,"c":21005,"t":61}}]}
