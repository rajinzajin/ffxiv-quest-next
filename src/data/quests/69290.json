I had a feeling you'd be back! I know not what the others have suggested, but there's simply no way it could hold a candle to the sheer boldness and brilliance of Bert the Beloved's advice!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"You can only vote once.<br>What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You have my support."},{"name":"A1","text":"What is it that you propose again?"},{"name":"A1","text":"I'd like to have a moment to think things over."},{"name":"BERT","text":"Many thanks, my friend!
