I was hoping you might stop by."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"As you well know by now, these facilities were built to meet any and all needs your people might have. However, you're not at all what we expected, and I don't mean just your exceedingly diminutive stature. A great number of changes must be made, including to our sentry drones."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"We have no frame of reference for what may pose a threat to your kind, and I believe a better understanding of your strength may enlighten us."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"Not just your physical strength, mind, but your strategic prowess as well, which is why I'd like to see how you fare in a fight. What do you say?"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"Wonderful! If you could meet me in Greatest Endsvale, I'll see that everything is ready when you get there."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"Let's get started, shall we? Activating terminal one. Begin data acquisition!"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"You certainly have a knack for battle. I can hardly imagine how strong your enemies must be. All the more reason our sentries are in serious need of improvements. Now, might I trouble you for one more test?"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"That's the spirit! I can't imagine you'll have much trouble after seeing that first display, but one can never have too much data. Let's try one of our drones from terminal two."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"That was incredible. You haven't been sneaking any iron carrots, have you? I had no idea your kind were so fearsome in battle."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"Maybe we should forget the sentries and have you guard Bestways Burrow. I jest, I jest─we would never dream of putting you or your people in harm's way. "},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"I want to thank you properly, but not here. Let's head back to the main plaza."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"The moon will be as safe as safe can be once the drones are refurbished, and thanks to you, I have all the data I could ask for."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"Though I did read something a touch concerning in one of the books our collaborators sent us. Something about certain drinks you imbibe that make you a threat to yourselves and everyone around you...? I hope our drones will be prepared for such an emergency..."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04247","text":"At any rate, I better get back to work. It's not much, but I'd like you to have this─a small token of thanks for your help."}],"reward":{"gil":815},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69942]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1040865","obj":{"i":1040865,"n":"Brawny Loporrit","l":3711,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69942","obj":{"i":69942,"n":"Setting Things Straight","g":11,"l":"Mare Lamentorum","s":560}}]}
