To show his appreciation for your efforts, he insists that you and your comrades attend the service as honored guests. He then asks you to inform the others while he sees to preparations.","You find Minfilia telling Thancred of your recent undertaking in the woods. She is delighted by their invitation, and promises not to be late. With Y'shtola and Urianger toiling away to decipher the tablet, you decide not to disturb them and make for the Darker.","In the dimly lit cave you find an elderly woman you believe to be the attendant Runar spoke of. Without saying a word she hands you a candle, and points to a spot on the floor close by.","Seeing the cluster of candles there on the floor, you place yours among them, and the attendant nods and smiles in answer. It would appear you have done your part in preparing for the service. All you can do now is wait for it to begin.","Before long, a procession of mourners enter the Darker. Among them you find Y'shtola and Urianger, who have taken a reprieve from working to pay their respects. They join you in the rear of the chamber, and a hush soon falls over the room.
