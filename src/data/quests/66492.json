However, if you wish to obtain the highest-quality sample, you must journey to the deepest depths and search for a corrupted cluster. Then, wielding the quarrying maul given to you by the scholar, you must fracture the cluster so that a smaller piece can be removed.","In the name of science, you strike the shimmering cluster with all your might. Sections of the fractured cluster can now be easily wrenched free.","With a sharp tug, you remove a fragment of the corrupted cluster and seal it within the warded pot, thus shielding you from its harmful energies. Of course, this does nothing to counteract the prolonged exposure to the cluster that you have already endured. Try not to ponder the potential ramifications of this fact as you make your way back to Highbridge and present the crystal to Hahasako.","Hahasako has naught but praise for your specimen, which he bids you show to the professor as well─at which time he expects you to recount to his mentor how instrumental his instructions were to your success.","Professor Lamberteint explains that your efforts in Thanalan have yielded a corrupted crystal that will only serve to strengthen Garuda's barrier. As this would be contrary to your goal, you have essentially wasted your time, regardless of what the good professor would have you believe."],"objectives":["Use the maul to fracture the corrupted cluster.","Use the warded pot to collect a corrupted crystal.","Present the corrupted crystal to Hahasako.","Present the corrupted crystal to Lamberteint."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HAHASAKO","text":"O frabjous day!

Yes, I, Hahasako, greatest of Professor Lamberteint's pupils, shall see that you successfully quarry your quarry."},{"name":"HAHASAKO","text":"Your timing is impeccable, in fact, for I was just preparing to procure corrupted crystals from the Burning Wall for my personal research."},{"name":"HAHASAKO","text":"There, the devastating destruction caused by the Calamity has blessed us with a bounty of sublime specimens."},{"name":"HAHASAKO","text":"But something tells me that naught but a perfect piece will satisfy your high standards. In which case, you must needs descend to the deepest depths. Amidst the flowing waters and the murderous mirrorknights lies the most fantastic formation I have found thus far."},{"name":"HAHASAKO","text":"Take this highly advanced researcher's tool and use it to separate a small fragment from the large cluster. Place it within the warded pot and bear it back to me for inspection."},{"name":"HAHASAKO","text":"The path which leads from Burgundy Falls to the base of the Burning Wall is treacherous and terrifying, but advance with appropriate caution and you shall surely survive."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"? tag ID says system, but no message pops as of 8/05"},{"name":"HAHASAKO","text":"I see you've come galumphing back. Have you the crystal then?"},{"name":"HAHASAKO","text":"What a prodigiously large and lovely crystal! Professor Lamberteint will doubtless chortle with joy when you present it to him in person. Oh, and upon your return, do remember to recount how I helped you with your harvesting."},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"My keen scholar's sense tells me that you've obtained a corrupted crystal. Am I right?"},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"If you would grant me a moment to examine the crystal... Ah, it is as you desired. A corrupted crystal overflowing with wind-aspected aether."},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"Hmmm... Remind me, for what purpose did you intend to use this crystal again? What!? To breach a barrier comprised of <span class=\"emphasis\">wind</span>-aspected aether? Oh dear... That may prove problematic, as this crystal would only serve to <span class=\"emphasis\">strengthen</span> the barrier."},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"I suppose I am at fault for not inquiring as to your objectives from the start. Had I known your intent, I would have never sent you to Hahasako."},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"But what is science if not trial and error? And can you truly say that this failure has taught you nothing?"},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"Think, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span>─you now understand the methods necessary to safely collect a corrupted crystal! You will doubtless have no difficulty doing so once more."},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"What's more, the crystal you collected can serve as an invaluable resource for the aetherial studies conducted by the Students of Baldesion."},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"You've heard of them? Well, I don't mean to boast, but I've a professional relationship with the organization. Not as equals, of course─I would never be so bold as to claim that level of expertise..."},{"name":"LAMBERTEINT","text":"Are you all right? Your eyes seem to have glazed over for a moment.
