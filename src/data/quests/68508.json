Arenvald duly volunteers to round up your fellow Scions, and bids you assemble with them in the Ala Mhigan Quarter.","At the appointed location, you rendezvous with Arenvald, who has succeeded in enlisting the aid of Alphinaud, Y'shtola, and Thancred. Deeming it best to have eyes both inside and outside the throne room, you proceed to divide your forces into two groups. Thancred and Y'shtola will keep watch without, while you and the others take up positions within. Make your way to the palace's rear entrance, on the eastern edge of the quarter, and identify yourself to the guard on duty.","In the midst of the meeting, the Qalyana broodmother somehow summons forth an incarnation of Sri Lakshmi, plunging the throne room into chaos. Too late, you realize that the guards entrusted with keeping the area free of crystals have themselves been enthralled. As the only warriors present blessed with the protection of the Echo, you and Arenvald must occupy the primal whilst your companions defend the visiting envoys from the Qalyana and the enthralled guards. Rally the hesitant Arenvald, and make your stand against the Lady of Bliss!<br><br>※In the event that you leave the palace, speak with the Resistance guard in the Ala Mhigan Quarter to re-enter the throne room.","Try as you might, the need to protect your allies from the primal's baleful influence renders you powerless to wrest the initiative from your foe─until, that is, Fordola arrives to even the odds. Swallowing your questions, you engage Sri Lakshmi together, and succeed at last in banishing her to the aether. The battle is over, but the Butcher still stands before you, free of her fetters, weapon in hand...","After a taut moment, Fordola surrenders her sword, and returns to her cell of her own accord. It would seem the danger has passed. Ask Lyse if she and her guests are unharmed.","After thanking you for your efforts in the throne room, Lyse returns to conclude her meeting with the envoys from Gyr Abania. No longer needed, you retire to the rooftop gardens, where you are joined after a time by Raubahn. The General tells you of the council's decision to form an elected government, signaling the end of his time in Ala Mhigo. You subsequently pass Nanamo on your way to speak with Lyse, and sense that Raubahn's plans to return to Ul'dah are about to encounter a sultana-sized wrinkle...","As you and your companions discuss the day's events, Nanamo arrives, flanked by Pipin and a rather sheepish-looking Raubahn. After some prompting by the sultana, the gruff warrior duly announces that he has been dismissed as leader of the Immortal Flames, and stripped of his seat on the Syndicate. Shocking though these revelations are, it does not take long for the assembled company to make light of them─and small wonder, for Ala Mhigo's dearest son is finally home. Speak with Lyse, and learn of her plans for the future.","For the moment, it seems that Lyse intends to return to Rhalgr's Reach. Follow Alphinaud's lead, and join her at the Resistance stronghold.","Lyse declares that her time as commander of the Resistance is over, and that she means to invite Raubahn to take her place. With Nanamo's resettlement project also proceeding apace, all present agree that the seeds of hope have at last begun to quicken in the war-torn land of Ala Mhigo."],"objectives":["Join your fellow Scions in the Ala Mhigan Quarter.","Speak with the Resistance guard.","Speak with Arenvald.","Speak with Lyse.","Speak with Lyse in Rhalgr's Reach."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Turning the Qalyana away now would've made a mockery of Lyse's promise to give everyone a say.

I appreciate the support you showed for my earlier decision, overruled though it was!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I think it's about time I headed back to Rhalgr's Reach. What's next for all of you?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Alisaie will be eager to hear of recent events, so I shall join you, if you've no objections."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I'd welcome the company! <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, why don't you come along to the Reach as well once you've said your farewells to Nanamo and the others."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Upon completion of this quest, you will be able to access the palace's rooftop gardens by speaking to the Royal Menagerie attendant."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Well, here we are again!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Alphinaud has regaled me with a thrilling tale of hidden treasure troves, mid-meeting betrayals, unlikely alliances, and joyous homecomings. It would seem I missed...everything."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"I was patrolling the palace grounds with Thancred and Y'shtola when we heard the report of a primal in the throne room. I honestly doubted my own ears."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"As others have said, we were lucky to have our Echo-blessed champions nearby this time, but we'll need to keep a closer eye on the Qalyana..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"You can say that again. This whole episode has reminded me just how far apart our kinds still are. It looks like centuries of fear and mistrust really <span class=\"emphasis\">can't</span> be washed away in a day. But someone has to make an effort at reconciliation if these conflicts are ever going to end."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Naturally, a lot of people are crying out for vengeance, but I've been doing my best to calm things down. Violent reprisals will only lead to more summonings."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Indeed. Violence will ever beget violence─as the Empire has learned to its cost in recent times."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"In any case, summoning Lakshmi was the broodmother's doing, and whoever replaces her might not be so keen on the idea. We'll just have to watch and wait."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Which isn't to say we won't be putting the safety of our allies in the Vira and M tribes first. I plan to have Resistance scouts keep track of the Qalyana's movements at all times."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"My parents will be relieved to hear that. What are your plans for the rest of the Resistance army, out of interest? Are we to prepare for imperial counterattacks?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"That would be a question for the Resistance's newest recruit─a military commander with far more experience than me!"},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"What? The Bull of Ala Mhigo!?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We call it an army, but the Resistance is really a collection of smaller, independent groups. And when Conrad passed his command on to me, that authority only extended to the freedom fighters based in Rhalgr's Reach."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"He just happened to be serving as the Resistance spokesman at the time, and needed someone to take over the role while everything was in disarray. But that time has passed."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"When I speak with the other leaders about reforming the army under the new government, I'll be nominating Raubahn as the overall commander of our forces. He has more experience than the rest of us put together, and we stand to learn a lot from him."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Indeed. He is in all respects the ideal choice. Assuming he accepts the post, Ala Mhigo will have added a formidable weapon to its arsenal."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And given the progress of Nanamo's resettlement initiative, I see great cause for hope. The seeds which we so carefully sowed have begun to quicken, my friends."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I like that. We tend to our promises, and watch as Ala Mhigo blooms."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"I do give thanks to the kami that my makeshift raft withstood the fury of the seas..."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"But there their generosity ended. Without coins in our pockets for new attire, we are doomed to look like so much jetsam. O, woe betide the poor man in a city of rich merchants..."},{"name":"YOTSUYU","text":"These dango are delicious! Will you have one?"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Hm!? <span class=\"emphasis\">More</span> sweetbreads!? I surrendered my blade to secure what few coins we have!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Bah! 'Tis like talking to a child..."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Why fate saddled me with this burden I shall never know...but I am alive, and I must return to my master's side!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Come, Tsuyu. We shall find a ship to carry us across the Ruby Sea!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Meanwhile, in the imperial palace..."},{"name":"GARLEANLEADERD","text":"Have you read the reports? First Doma, then Ala Mhigo─and Lord Zenos put to the sword!"},{"name":"GARLEANLEADERE","text":"Do not believe everything you read. I hear the viceroy was merely wounded, and that he has already returned to the capital. Naturally, the savages beat their chests, and boast loudly of taking his head, regardless."},{"name":"GARLEANLEADERD","text":"Nay... Lord Zenos <span class=\"emphasis\">lives</span>?"},{"name":"GARLEANLEADERE","text":"Deplorable. That our own officers should be fooled by Eorzean misinformation..."},{"name":"GARLEANLEADERE","text":"Small wonder the provinces have begun rising up in rebellion.
