And how differently would we view the world had we a better understanding of its past? Little is known of Shiva's life and deeds, yet the heretics venerate her as a saint. Ser Aymeric's ancestors are said to have founded Ishgard by the will of Halone, yet he admits that scripture only tells so much. Ultimately, however, the details of his people's war with the dragons are irrelevant. Regardless of how the conflict began, it is destined to continue─unless Iceheart's plan succeeds, which the Scions cannot allow. While Minfilia and the others search for a means to breach Iceheart's sanctuary, you are to assist Yuyuhase and the 3rd Unit Braves in tracking down the heretics who attempted to ambush the allied forces.","The heretics were last seen heading towards Daniffen Pass, and the 3rd Unit Braves are already in pursuit. Yuyuhase leaves to join them and bids you follow. Do as bade and speak with any 3rd Unit Braves you find.","Many of the 3rd Unit Braves are unaccustomed to the frigid conditions in Coerthas, and the young man you find kneeling in the snow is no exception. Having twisted his ankle, he is no longer able to keep up. Press on without him and join the others south of Daniffen Pass.","You come across several sets of tracks which appear to belong to the Braves and their quarry. Follow them southwest and keep your eyes peeled for both friend and foe.","You find a solitary Brave. Though not seriously injured, he is clearly disoriented and in no condition to fight. According to him, the heretics split up, prompting the Braves to do so as well─and Yuyuhase followed one trail alone. Search for the officer in the woods to the east.","You rescue Yuyuhase from certain death, slaying Iceheart's followers before they can deliver the telling blow. Speak with the Crystal Brave and confirm his condition.","Yuyuhase reveals that he was able to slay one heretic, and was in the process of searching his victim's body when the dead man's comrades surprised and overpowered him. With a grin, he then produces a piece of parchment and proceeds to read you the message written thereon. It would seem to be an escape plan devised in the aftermath of the heretics' failed ambush at Snowcloak. The plan mentions a rendezvous point near the Observatorium, as well as a merchant sympathetic to the heretics' cause. Search the outskirts of the Observatorium and seize the fugitives before they escape.","Outside the walls of the Observatorium, you chance upon the merchant and a single heretic, who subsequently attempt to flee. However, they are stopped in their tracks by the unexpected arrival of Captain Ilberd, Alphinaud, and Yugiri. After Ilberd takes them into custody, Alphinaud explains that they had been seeking the merchant in connection with their investigation into the Ivy. Wait with Alphinaud inside the gates while Captain Ilberd interrogates the merchant.","The interrogation of the merchant is not expected to take long, but Alphinaud is doubtful that it will yield any useful information. The Ivy would surely not be so careless. Be that as it may, all you can do now is wait and hope that your fellow Scion is wrong."],"objectives":["Speak with Yuyuhase.","Pursue the heretics towards Daniffen Pass.","Search for the heretics south of Daniffen Pass.","Follow the heretics' trail.","Speak with Yuyuhase.","Search for the heretics outside the Observatorium.","Speak with Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Antecedent.

What would they have done in your position, I wonder..."},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"...There are those who believe that faith is a renunciation of free will─that unquestioning devotion is required of all who would live a life in service to the Fury."},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"Such righteous fervor may well serve a knight on the front line─less so a leader of men."},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"We are all at liberty to interpret the scriptures as we will.

They have them both in abundance."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"...Can that truly be all that is required?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"My survey team has concluded a preliminary analysis of the aetheryte Iceheart used to escape. They believe that she teleported to another aetheryte, somewhere not far to the west."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Despite the apparent proximity of this second aetheryte, however, they have been wholly unable to detect its presence directly. Unless Iceheart has some means to mask its signal, I can only presume she had it destroyed to prevent us from following her."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Without the means to teleport as she did, we have no choice but to search for an alternate route─most likely a tunnel─assuming one exists."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Let us not give up on teleportation just yet.

Give the signal and wait─the merchant will be watching. Be late and be left for dead.”"},{"name":"YUYUHASE","text":"Speaks for itself, does it not?

I presume your work with the 3rd brought you hither?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"What a tangled web... Lest you wonder, we came not for the heretics, but for the merchant who has been conspiring with them."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"He came to our attention during the course of our investigation into the Ivy. It beggars belief, I know, but it seems our favorite Garlean spy may have been providing assistance to Iceheart."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Were it not for the efforts of Lady Yugiri and her shinobi, we might never have discovered this connection."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Master Alphinaud is too kind. I fear my people and I have done little to aid your search for this spy."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"We long to strike back against the Empire and weaken their influence in this land─to prevent the tragedy which befell Doma from reoccurring."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"The days ahead and the work they promise will require a very particular set of skills. Skills which I am fortunate enough to possess. If you will allow it, I would accompany you until the investigation is complete."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"That is a most generous offer, Lady Yugiri, and one which I gladly accept."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Thank you. Though I may disappear for a time, know that I shall never be far, and shall always be watching."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...A comforting thought. Come, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Let us wait inside for Captain Ilberd to return and deliver his report."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Captain Ilberd seemed confident that the merchant's resolve would swiftly crumble when pressed. If so, we should have new information ere long."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"As to whether it will bring us any closer to learning the Ivy's identity, I would rather not say. Given our adversary's cunning, I shall consider us fortunate if we are spared another wild-dodo chase.
