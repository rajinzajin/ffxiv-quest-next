Return to Ingaret so she can do her part.","Ingaret thanks you for your help and pays you your share of the bounty on the beasts. She also tells you about a farm on the far side of the bridge.

It's in desperate need of repairs, but the upland mylodons roam far too close to itâ”€the craftsmen can't work safely. Someone needs to kill them... The mylodons, that is! Not the craftsmen!<br>I'd ask the dragoons to do it, but they're so busy it'd be weeks before they found the time.
