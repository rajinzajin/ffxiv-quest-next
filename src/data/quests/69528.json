Join the guildmaster in his spying efforts near the castle gates.","Golden Goliath finally makes his exit from the castle, and you and Martyn begin tailing your prey. You follow along, undetected, and eventually arrive at Pier #2...","After a brief talk with the falcon porter, Martyn informs you that Golden Goliath appears to have commandeered a special bird on a direct route to the village of Namai. The guildmaster urges you to hurry to the settlement in Yanxia before your quarry is lost.","You rendezvous with Martyn in Namai in time to see that the inhabitants are obviously familiar with the strange behavior of Golden Goliath. Reasoning that the residents might know the mysterious combatant better than the citizens of Kugane, Martyn suggests that the two of you split up and ask a few questions.","Your conversations with the villagers reveal that Golden Goliath was formerly known as “Gogo,” a mimicry artist of some renown in the region. Seek out Martyn, and share your revelations.","Although your investigations turned up some interesting facts, it would seem that Martyn has made a new friend who is willing to divulge a more complete history of the enigmatic Golden Goliath. The old villager reveals that “Gogo,” as the champion was otherwise known, was part of his troupe of performers in the time before Lord Kaien's rebellion. A miraculous mimic, Gogo gained fame for his impossible imitations before a change in fortune saw him seek out a new stage as the undefeated star of the Fukumen Fighting Festival.<br><br>Fascinated and dismayed by Golden Goliath's seemingly supernatural ability to mirror his opponent's aetherial flow, Martyn suggests a withdrawal to Kugane while he formulates a plan of action...","By the time you return to the docks of Kugane, Martyn has decided on his strategy for tackling the formidable Golden Goliath. Footwork and flexibility will be the key to victory, and it is with this goal in mind that the guildmaster returns to his training. Or at least he will, once the customers have been served their tea.<br><br>※The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon reaching level 70 and learning Aetherial Spark."],"objectives":["Speak with Martyn.","Speak with Martyn once more.","Speak with Martyn in Namai.","Question the inhabitants of Namai.","Speak with Martyn.","Speak with Martyn in Kugane."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MARTYN","text":"You've come a long way, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but I'm not sensing any “vibrations”...ultra, or otherwise."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The next blue mage quest will be available from Martyn upon learning Ultravibration."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Masterin' Ultravibration didn't get you shaken to pieces, I see."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Me, I've been headin' out when I can to work on the puzzle of old Goldie. But no matter how many pieces I find, I just can't seem to put a picture together."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"About the best I can think of is to follow him after a match, and see if he lets somethin' slip."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Come on. The boss has given me the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">evenin'</span><span class=\"alternative\">mornin'</span><span class=\"alternative\">afternoon</span></span> off, so it's now or never."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"The match should be over soon. Let's stay out of sight and wait for our friend, shall we?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Here we go. Not too close, now..."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Goldie hopped on one of those huge birds and flew off somewhere. The handler tells me he's bound straight for a village called Namai, and pays extra for the unusual route."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"I'll take a boat across to Yanxia right now so we don't lose him, but join me over there as soon as you can."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Looks like your average farmin' settlement to me... Wait, ain't that our man over there?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"...Bit of an odd one, ain't he?"},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Huh, so he's some kind of mimic. Strange thing to be doin' in the middle of the street, but the villagers don't seem surprised by his antics."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"They must know him here─or better than they do in Kugane, at any rate. What say we split up and ask a few questions?"},{"name":"NAMAIMAIDEN03992","text":"Golden...Goliath? I've never heard that name. Maybe you can ask one of the grown-ups?"},{"name":"MIYAKE","text":"Ah, Golden Goliath─that's what they call him in Hingashi, is it not? Around here, we know him as “Gogo.”"},{"name":"MIYAKE","text":"He used to perform for us in the enclave, but the imperials had little use for a mimicker's talents. We were proud to hear he had met with such success over in Kugane."},{"name":"NAMAIFARMHAND03992","text":"Who? Oh, you mean Gogo. That arena name always throws me off but, yes, I know him well. He and I grew up here together, as a matter of fact."},{"name":"NAMAIFARMHAND03992","text":"The man's talent for mimicry is nothing short of miraculous. He'd always been naturally good at it, then spent endless hours in practice till he was <span class=\"emphasis\">perfect</span>. "},{"name":"NAMAIMAIDEN03992","text":"Sorry, I don't know any “gold” people..."},{"name":"MIYAKE","text":"I miss the days when Gogo was an entertainer in Doma, but there was no future in it. Better that he find his fortune in Kugane."},{"name":"NAMAIFARMHAND03992","text":"I've never seen anyone exactly like Gogo, yet he can be <span class=\"emphasis\">exactly</span> like anyone else."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Ah, good timin', <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. My new mate here was just about to tell the story of Golden Goliath's rise to fame..."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"Well, it all goes back to the time I was an impresario. Golden Goliath was one of the performers under my wing, although he went by just plain “Gogo” back then."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"This was in the years before Lord Kaien's rebellion. We lived under the imperials' rule, but I suppose they saw no harm in letting us stage a few shows. And let me tell you, even then, Gogo was a crowd favorite."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"They couldn't get enough of him. With little more than a glance, he could mimic any gesture or expression with jaw-dropping exactitude."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"His proficiency extended even to the techniques of samurai and ninja─such skills take years to acquire, and he would execute them flawlessly within moments."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"There was once an enraged samurai lord who sought to cut him down for his impudence, but Gogo replicated the attack so swiftly that the swordsman found himself on the defensive. In that moment, we witnessed him elevate the act of mimicry from performance art to <span class=\"emphasis\">martial</span> art."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"The brutal suppression which followed Lord Kaien's uprising, however, marked an end to such entertainments. Gogo was forced off the stage...but his dedication to his craft never wavered."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"Later, rumors reached us of men who vied with monsters by using their own bestial attacks against them. Gogo was intrigued. He took ship to Kugane to see this spectacle for himself, and enlisted as a combatant in the Fukumen Fighting Festival."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"For one such as Gogo, imitating the art of blue wizardry was simplicity itself. Even in the arena, he needed but the blink of an eye to understand and master the attacks of his feral opponents. Not once did he taste defeat."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"And when challengers came forth to contest his supremacy, their techniques, too, did he turn against them. One by one, they fell, and so did the legend of Golden Goliath arise."},{"name":"CALMMAN03992","text":"That is all I can say for now. As for the next chapter of Gogo's saga, well, that is something we all look forward to hearing."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Bloody hells... From the way the old man described it, Goldie's mimicry sounds like a more advanced form of blue magic."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"We have to work for our spells, right? You provoke a creature into displayin' an ability, and <span class=\"emphasis\">then</span> you absorb its aether once you've won the fight."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"But Goldie skips past that last bit, and picks up new tricks almost immediately."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"And it doesn't even need to be a monster! Swordplay, spellcraft, anythin' an opponent throws at him, he can learn."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Just copyin' their movements wouldn't be enough─it's as if he perceives the attacks on some deeper level and mirrors the exact flow of their aether."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Somethin' like that would take a natural gift for observation, honed by years of patient study. Goldie, as we just discovered, has devoted his entire life to the art of mimicry, and I reckon this─ironic'ly inimitable─talent is his reward."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Even expert blue mages like you and me must seem like infants to him. There must be some way to claw out a victory..."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Let's head back to Kugane for the moment, and I'll try to think up a plan along the way."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Well, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I gave it some thought, and I believe I've hit upon a winnin' strategy."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Goldie's mimicry is a formidable weapon, there's no doubt about that. But just because he's learned a bunch of spells and stuff doesn't mean he knows the best way to use them."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Footwork and flexibility! That's what's important. And when it comes to battle instincts, I think I have the upper hand over some stage performer."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"It'll just be a case of dodgin' his attacks, while makin' sure I land a good wallopin' of my own. He won't even know what hit him."},{"name":"MARTYN","text":"Speakin' of improvements, why don't you see about learnin' Aetherial Spark? I'll be busy trainin' for my grand rematch, anyway...once I'm done servin' tea."}],"reward":{"gil":1950},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":129}],"quests":[69527]},"next":[69529]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1035096","obj":{"i":1035096,"n":"Martyn","l":2404,"q":4}},{"type":"quest","id":"69527","obj":{"i":69527,"n":"Azuro and Goliath","g":166,"l":"Kugane","s":650,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69529","obj":{"i":69529,"n":"Master of Mimicry","g":166,"l":"Kugane","s":700,"f":1}}]}
