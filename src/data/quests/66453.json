Though he cannot provide a more accurate location at the moment, he is confident that, with the right astroscope log, he could calculate one. To that end, he asks that you bring to him volume six of the 1572 readings─a large red leather-bound tome, which should be stored on the uppermost floor of the Observatorium.","Much to your surprise, you quickly locate and retrieve the correct volume. Return to the cataloger and present to him the tome.","The cataloger quickly concludes that the airship landed somewhere near the Stone Vigil, which means that it was almost certainly seized by the garrison which occupied it at the time. Report your findings to Lord Haurchefant and see what advice he proffers.","Lord Haurchefant explains that the Stone Vigil is currently held by Dravanian forces, and that all access to the ruined outpost is restricted by House Durendaire. To help you obtain permission to enter the Stone Vigil, he writes for you a letter of introduction to Lord Drillemont of Whitebrim Front. However, he suspects that his endorsement alone will not suffice, and he advises you to ask Lord Francel to write a letter for you as well.","Lord Francel is happy to oblige your request. Before you depart, he reminds you that the cravens who attempted to destroy House Haillenarte have yet to be revealed, and that they may target you in the future in retaliation for your interference. Duly warned, proceed to Whitebrim Front and present your letters to the sentry at the gates.","The surly sentry's demeanor quickly changes when he recognizes the seals on the letters you bear. Nevertheless, he seems reluctant to simply wave you inside..."],"objectives":["<span class=\"highlight-yellow\">* This quest has been adjusted.

I pray his information proves useful to you."},{"name":"NPC","text":"How quickly the commoners' opinions change. They say Lord Francel is innocent now, but just a few days prior..."},{"name":"NPC","text":"Anyway, you were inquiring as to the whereabouts of an airship last seen in Coerthas several days before the Calamity, yes? Well, it so happens that I was monitoring the night sky at the Observatorium during that period. I recall that a small vessel came from the direction of Gridania and landed somewhere in the far northwest."},{"name":"NPC","text":"Relying on my memory alone, I can say no more than that. However, were you to bring me the astroscope log from the evening in question, I could calculate a more accurate location."},{"name":"NPC","text":"The log I require is volume six of the 1572 readings. It should be stored with the other past logs on the uppermost floor of the Observatorium, just below the astroscope. I believe it will be a large red leather-bound tome─though you ought to confirm the date and volume number if you are at all unsure."},{"name":"NPC","text":"The past logs are all stored on the uppermost floor of the Observatorium. There's no security, so you can freely peruse them. Of course, even if you did find the correct volume on your own, it would be useless without an astrologian to interpret the data."},{"name":"NPC","text":"Did you perchance find the correct log? The sixth volume from 1572? I would understand if you failed─the other catalogers were often careless when returning old volumes to the shelf."},{"name":"NPC","text":"My word, you actually found it! &lt;sniff&gt; &lt;sniff&gt; This musty old smell brings back such fond memories... Ah, here we are! If you would permit me a moment to make some calculations..."},{"name":"NPC","text":"Hmmm... It is as I feared. The ship landed near the Stone Vigil, of all places, which means that the garrison almost certainly seized the vessel and brought it within their walls. If so, then you would need an army of knights to have any hope of securing it."},{"name":"NPC","text":"Though Lord Haurchefant is, from all indications, quite fond of you, so mayhap he can lend you a few? In any case, I have done my part. I shall pray for your success, friend."},{"name":"HAURCHEFANT","text":"Oh, so you've at last located the <span class=\"emphasis\">Enterprise</span>! I believe congratulations are in order."},{"name":"HAURCHEFANT","text":"The Stone Vigil? Ah...perhaps I spoke too soon. The outpost has been held by the dragons for years, and all access is restricted by decree of House Durendaire."},{"name":"HAURCHEFANT","text":"I will write a letter to Lord Drillemont of Whitebrim Front and request that he grant you permission to enter. That said, I fear my influence alone will not suffice, so I suggest that you request Lord Francel do the same."},{"name":"HAURCHEFANT","text":"Now that your business in Camp Dragonhead is concluded, I suspect we may not meet again for some time."},{"name":"HAURCHEFANT","text":"I wish you well in your journeys, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

The fiends have held the outpost ever since."},{"name":"FRANCEL","text":"As we lack the strength of arms to retake the Stone Vigil, House Durendaire instead has been charged with the duty.
