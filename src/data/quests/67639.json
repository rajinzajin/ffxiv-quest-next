He has arranged for a lightly guarded caravan as bait, and would have you and Y'mhitra be present to assist in engaging the dangerous mage. Make your way to Camp Bluefog in northern Thanalan, and speak with the captain to learn the details of the ambush.","You arrive in Camp Bluefog, and Dancing Wolf explains his simple plan: the caravan, carrying a shipment of crystals, will conveniently break an axle on its way to the processing plant. You, Y'mhitra, and the captain are to take up positions nearby, and await Tristan's attack. Head to your assigned position, and stay alert for the black-robed madman.","Lured by the promise of easy plunder, a mage and his flame-enshrouded familiar have appeared and assaulted the caravan. Defeat the ebon-clad summoner and Ifrit-Egi, and put an end to the string of callous attacks.","Following a furious exchange of arcane violence, the black-robed villain lies defeated at your feet. Tend now to the wounded courier decoy.","Dancing Wolf and Y'mhitra join you at the scene of the battle, after defeating opponents of their own. Upon inspecting the body of the summoner, however, the flame captain is astonished to discover that the assailant is not Tristan, but Tristan's elder brother, Kahedin. It is then that the Ascian of the Twelfth Chalice appears, lamenting his decision to employ the siblings as pawns. The Paragon proceeds to laud the primal-slaying efforts of the Bringer of Light, before vanishing as abruptly as he had appeared. Return now to the Hall of Flames in Ul'dah, and discuss these revelations with Dancing Wolf.","The identity of the black-robed menace has finally been revealed as the long-dead Kahedin─a reanimated puppet of a powerful Ascian. Though Tristan and his brother are now free of the Paragon's manipulations, Dancing Wolf is intent on exacting vengeance on the callous immortal. Y'mhitra counsels caution, warning that the servants of Darkness are not to be lightly challenged. To that end, the researcher then instructs you in yet another secret of ancient Allagan magicks. Continue your efforts to master the art of summoning that you might benefit from the wisdom hidden within the remaining tomestones.<br><br>※The next summoner quest will be available from Dancing Wolf upon reaching level 58."],"objectives":["Speak with Dancing Wolf at Camp Bluefog.","Lie in wait at the designated location.","Defeat the ebon-clad summoner and Ifrit-Egi.","Aid the courier decoy.","Speak with Dancing Wolf at the Hall of Flames."],"dialogue":[{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"Greetings, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

Let us put Captain Wolf's plan into action!"},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you're here. Good. Our “crystal couriers” have just left camp."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"The plan is simple: the caravan will head towards the processing plant, but conveniently break an axle before reaching the east watchtower."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"We three will take up separate positions nearby, and wait for Tristan to take the bait─I've had the driver complaining long and loudly about the lack of a suitable escort for his precious cargo, so we can be reasonably sure that an attack will come."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"I trust you need no further explanations? Head to your assigned position, and do your best to keep out of sight."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Is aught amiss? This tree is hardly big enough to conceal the both of us..."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"If I've read him aright, Tristan will be unable to resist this lure.

Uh, it's a pleasure to meet you and all, but you'd best keep your distance─we wouldn't want the enemy avoiding our carefully laid trap, eh?"},{"name":"SOLDIER02103","text":"Aaargh! It burns!

Took me by surprise..."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"The same happened to me. Another man in dark robes stepped through some manner of portal, and assailed me with spells."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"My position also came under attack─an underling, judging by the ease with which I dispatched him. But I have never before seen such teleportation magicks..."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"...No!

That voice... You were the one who taught Tristan the art of summoning! Have you come to inflict yet more misery upon the world!?"},{"name":"ASCIANSCUP","text":"...Tristan? Yes, that was the other's name. I had hoped to groom him─granted him the knowledge of Allag's mages that he might unleash his wrath against the primals. Alas, he was all too easily vanquished..."},{"name":"ASCIANSCUP","text":"No matter. The Bringer of Light has proven a more-than-adequate replacement for my failed god-slayer."},{"name":"ASCIANSCUP","text":"With every primal you kill, the beastmen's fervor grows ever hotter. We need but supply the tribes with crystals...and watch as they summon ever more terrible deities!"},{"name":"ASCIANSCUP","text":"When the confluence of chaos reaches its peak, the world shall be swallowed in Darkness. Our master shall rise again..."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"...He's gone."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"And we should be gone as well.

I should have suspected..."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"...I believe some reassessment is in order. We now know that the black-robed menace we thought to be Tristan was actually his brother, Kahedin─a reanimated puppet, under the control of an Ascian."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"Both brothers were present at Ifrit's defeat, so Kahedin's aura, too, would have been stained with the primal's essence. Which, if I understand correctly, would explain his ability to command the egi."},{"name":"DANCINGWOLF","text":"But for that Ascian to raise the lad's corpse and press him into service as his pet summoner... I shall see the blackguard suffer for his cruel depravity!"},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"Aye, the Paragon has many crimes for which he must answer. But we must move with great caution─the power of these immortals is not to be underestimated."},{"name":"YMHITRA","text":"I will return to Gridania, and redouble my efforts to decipher the remaining tomestones.
