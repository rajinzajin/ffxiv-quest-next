I lack the sense of “time” as perceived by those of finite lifespans, but might you be able to spare a moment to speak with some of my fellow Ea?"},{"name":"NOHNOOKH","text":"It is rare to find one so unmarred by the scars of deepest wisdom. Your appearance and perceptions as an outsider differ so much from our own that I wonder if a degree of interaction might prove...<span class=\"emphasis\">stimulating</span> for both parties."},{"name":"NOHNOOKH","text":"...Much obliged. I shall mark their location on your map. They tend to spend considerable time frequenting their usual haunts."},{"name":"NOHNOOKH","text":"In case you are concerned, please know there is no need to be modest when you approach them. They can be quite sociable once they get to know you."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"Hm? ...What a curious being you are. Have my peers discovered how to regain their corporeal forms while I remained lost in thought? ...No, of course not. Come to think of it, I wonder if we ever possessed the peculiar form that you now do."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"...Oh, dear. I fear this always happens when I delve too deep into such ruminations. The very moment I attempt to regain clarity, it triggers this most unpleasant reaction."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"If my fellow Ea have not found a way for us to reacquire our corporeality, perhaps it falls to me to meditate further upon the matter. In any event, pray leave me to my cogitations."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"Might you kindly leave me to my ruminations? I daresay I am nearly on the verge of a philosophical breakthrough."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"Hm? Oh, you must be that traverser from beyond who has been causing quite the stir around our abode."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"What a stroke of luck! In fact, I had been hoping I might have the opportunity to exchange thoughts with you and your companions."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"For you see, I have for too long whiled away my days in listless banality, drifting waywardly as my mental faculties dulled and slowed. I so longed to strike up a stimulating conversation with a traveler, yet for so long none would pay me visit..."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"That said, I never imagined you would have such a strange physical form! Pray tell, how do you keep your balance? What keeps your innards from spilling out through one of the multiple orifices in your body?"},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"...Oh, but pardon me. Truly, I meant no offense. Clearly, life in your world found this shape to be suitable─perhaps even necessary─for your survival. Perhaps our own original form was equally horrifying..."},{"name":"MEDITATION4346","text":"Seeing you makes me wonder, indeed, what our corporeal forms once looked like. Would our limbs be as lanky and unwieldy? Our heads as bulbous and unbalanced? Perhaps we resembled your kind in more ways than not..."},{"name":"SPENDTIME4346","text":"...How curious. An unfamiliar corporeal life-form calls out to me, as I wait in vain for the inevitable coming of the end."},{"name":"SPENDTIME4346","text":"This is indeed the chance of a lifetime─mayhap of many lifetimes. And so I pose to you this question. Tell me, traveler: what is the true nature of life and the universe?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"An eternal adventure."},{"name":"A1","text":"A deep forest where predators lurk."},{"name":"A1","text":"Forty-two."},{"name":"SPENDTIME4346","text":"It would seem you still have much to learn. And yet...I almost envy your blissful ignorance. It reminds me of feelings that I and my kind have long since forgotten..."},{"name":"SPENDTIME4346","text":"It is true that the vast reaches of space are fraught with dangers beyond your ability to even fathom. And yet, the end will come for them, too. As such, any struggle for supremacy is ultimately meaningless."},{"name":"SPENDTIME4346","text":"Why...precisely! That is the very conclusion I arrived at myself. How heartening─and surprising, I daresay─to meet one as enlightened as myself."},{"name":"SPENDTIME4346","text":"The end of our universe is inevitable, our actions entirely devoid of meaning. This is the one and only truth of existence."},{"name":"NOHNOOKH","text":"Did you encounter my acquaintances? I can only hope that they derived the same sense of stimulation from conversing with you as I myself did."},{"name":"NOHNOOKH","text":"For if so, we may yet discover a means to attain the moratorium known as death. Until that time, should you ever be in the mood for a discussion on the profound and inevitable meaninglessness of the universe, we will be here waiting. Yes, always waiting..."}],"reward":{"gil":735,"aetherCurrent":1},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69994]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1038016","obj":{"i":1038016,"n":"Noh-nookh","l":3712,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69994","obj":{"i":69994,"n":"Where Kn∞wledge Leads","g":11,"l":"Ultima Thule","s":612}}]}
