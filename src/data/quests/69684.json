It seems the sugar content of the sweetener weakened its usual effects, preventing the dough from being fully leavened."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"Which means that if we can create a yeast more properly suited to sweetened dough, then our bread will be as moist as we care to make it!"},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"Knowing, however, is not quite the same as doing. While I understand the basics, formulating yeast from scratch is rather beyond my current abilities..."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"Once more, I must call upon you to “rise” to the occasion! Ahem, sorry..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The Studium Deliveries list for Debroye has been updated. To view the new list, speak with Debroye."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"I'm afraid our bread will never be all that it can be if we cannot solve this yeastly dilemma..."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"Wonderful! If my reasoning is correct, then this yeast should be compatible with our sweet dough."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"Now this is some potent-looking yeast! Trust me, after the hours I spent staring at such things during my studies, the quality is obvious!"},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"Thanks to all your hard work, the third test batch of panaloaf turned out just as moist as we'd hoped!"},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"And all without compromising the original integrity of its nutritional content."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"It was well received by the clientele at the Last Stand, and even our difficult-to-please regular gave it his seal of approval."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"I would, however, like to hear the opinion of the─to my knowledge─foremost gourmand in Sharlayan."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"I speak of Master Dickon, the owner of the Last Stand. Everything I know about gourmet cooking, I owe to that man. Come, why don't we go and see what he has to say?"},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"Master Dickon, what did you think of the third batch?"},{"name":"DICKON","text":"Aye, it's a decent loaf, alright."},{"name":"DICKON","text":"Certainly a far cry from what you started with─that very first sample tasted like a sponge fished out of a sewer ditch. I expect you have your new friend to thank for this sudden leap in progress...?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Debroye's efforts made all the difference!"},{"name":"A1","text":"I swore a vendetta against that foul-tasting evil!"},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"I could hardly have done it alone! Without your practical talents, I would still be stuck daydreaming by the oven."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"Oh, my dear <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you are a gourmet after my own heart─a crusader for culinary quality!"},{"name":"DICKON","text":"Be that as it may, you yet have work to do. You've worked wonders with the taste and the texture, but there's no <span class=\"emphasis\">aroma</span>. It needs a savory scent to draw you in, and set your mouth to watering."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"So it isn't...smelly enough."},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"The road to gastronomic excellence is never-ending, it seems. But if that is what it takes to earn your full approval, then we must bake on!"},{"name":"DICKON","text":"Ah, you remind me of old Mervyn. He was the fellow who built this place, and dedicated his life to bringing fine food to Sharlayan."},{"name":"DICKON","text":"That life ended before he'd truly accomplished his goal, and the Last Stand passed on to me. Even now, gourmet cooking remains something of a foreign concept in this nation."},{"name":"DICKON","text":"It's the kind of place where puffed-up experts like your professor label their nutritional experiments the “perfect meal.” As if anything with such a revolting flavor could ever be deemed perfect!"},{"name":"DICKON","text":"Listen, the Last Stand was named so for a reason. We're a cultural outpost─the final defense against those who would condemn Sharlayan's diet to blandness and monotony!"},{"name":"DICKON","text":"If you share Mervyn's dream─and I believe you do─then I implore you to carry on his legacy!"},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"After hearing what Master Dickon had to say, I'm more determined than ever to make a truly perfected panaloaf!"},{"name":"DEBROYE","text":"As before, allow me some time to cogitate on the problem, and then we can see about adding a tantalizing aroma to the next batch of bread."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Debroye is delighted with your efforts.
