Where are the others? I thought all of you were going to attend?"},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Everything appears to be in order. Very good, very good..."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"Enjoy your time with M'naago and her kin? Aye, that's what I want to hear. Too many soldiers forget the importance of time away from all this."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"On behalf of the Elder Seedseer, I thank you for your swift and decisive action against the primal menace. We are not unaware of the danger it posed to our fair nation."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"The imperials underestimated us once, and they paid dearly for it. They may not be so easily deceived next time─but if we cannot fool them, we will simply have to break them!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"So that's why the village was unharmed..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I don't know why the imperials would abandon Ala Ghiri without a fight, but I'm glad they did."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Rather cowardly of them. Uncharacteristically so..."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"Well, you heard the Flame General. Looks like we've got a meeting to attend!"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"That everyone? Then let us begin."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Ala Ghiri is ours, and for a mercy we took it without losing a single man. But we dare not grow complacent─Specula Imperatoris will not be so easily won."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If I may, General─should we not pause to consider the imperials' motivations? For Zenos to surrender a fortified settlement of strategic importance without so much as firing a shot is...inexplicable."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"We searched the village and found no traps or other signs of sabotage. Suspicious though it may be, I will not refuse this gift from our enemy."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"The path to Ala Mhigo is through the east─through Specula Imperatoris, and Castrum Abania. It bears repeating, however, that the latter is home to a massive cannon with unparalleled range and destructive power."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Which means that we will need to strike Specula Imperatoris quickly, both to limit their ability to locate our forces in the field, and to utilize the installation as a shield against attack, as they would doubtless not risk damaging the towers."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I see... Then we have no choice but to accept what we have been given."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"Aye, that's the way of it. I've no doubt that Zenos has got something planned, but we'll just have to deal with it when the time comes."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"To the assault, then. The main host will commence a direct assault on Specula Imperatoris. During this time, I would hold the Scions in reserve at Ala Ghiri to deal with any imperial forces that may be dispatched in response."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Understood."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Wait a minute! We should be fighting with you and the Resistance!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I understand you don't want to rely too much on <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> after what <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span>'s been through, but at least let the rest of us do our part!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"If she wants to fight, I say let her fight!"},{"name":"A1","text":"...Don't do anything too reckless, all right?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Thanks. I knew you would understand."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I won't. I promise I'll do what Conrad says."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...Mayhap it would be best if I accompanied you. Alisaie can stay with <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Oh, go if you must. The two of us can take care of ourselves."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"You have your orders. Dismissed!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"So full of fire and eager, weren't they? Well, I wouldn't worry too much. They're strong and they have each other."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"At least he spared me the trouble of having to speak up. I wasn't about to let Lyse go alone..."}],"reward":{"gil":631,"items":[{"id":18674,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18680,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18686,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18698,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5668,"one":1}],"xp":232200},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":142}],"quests":[68070]},"next":[68072,68365,68366,68367,68368,68369]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1020600","obj":{"i":1020600,"n":"M'naago","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020630","obj":{"i":1020630,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":6}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020601","obj":{"i":1020601,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020602","obj":{"i":1020602,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020603","obj":{"i":1020603,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020604","obj":{"i":1020604,"n":"Raubahn","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020605","obj":{"i":1020605,"n":"Conrad","l":2407,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020632","obj":{"i":1020632,"n":"Pipin","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020638","obj":{"i":1020638,"n":"Serpent Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020639","obj":{"i":1020639,"n":"Storm Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"item","id":"18674","obj":{"i":18674,"n":"Gazelleskin Coat of Fending","l":285,"c":43370,"t":35,"p":36267}},{"type":"item","id":"18680","obj":{"i":18680,"n":"Gazelleskin Corselet of Maiming","l":285,"c":43372,"t":35,"p":36267}},{"type":"item","id":"18686","obj":{"i":18686,"n":"Gazelleskin Corselet of Striking","l":285,"c":43373,"t":35,"p":36267}},{"type":"item","id":"18698","obj":{"i":18698,"n":"Gazelleskin Corselet of Scouting","l":285,"c":43374,"t":35,"p":36267}},{"type":"item","id":"5668","obj":{"i":5668,"n":"Heavens' Eye Materia V","l":160,"c":20258,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Direct Hit Rate","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68070","obj":{"i":68070,"n":"The First of Many","g":6,"l":"The Fringes","s":940}},{"type":"quest","id":"68072","obj":{"i":68072,"n":"Hells Open","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":960}},{"type":"quest","id":"68365","obj":{"i":68365,"n":"Back to Business","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8010}},{"type":"quest","id":"68366","obj":{"i":68366,"n":"Bottoms Up","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8050}},{"type":"quest","id":"68367","obj":{"i":68367,"n":"Undeserved Praise","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8020}},{"type":"quest","id":"68368","obj":{"i":68368,"n":"Like a Charm","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8030}},{"type":"quest","id":"68369","obj":{"i":68369,"n":"A Sister's Ambition","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8040}}]}
