Recalling that she spoke of the importance of eating food rich in nutrients, both to heal the body and to nurture the growing life within, the young Ondo would serve the clutchmother a hearty meal, made with the liver of a mnyiri─which he hopes you will procure in his stead.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Dispatching the mnyiri is not particularly difficult, but extracting its liver is another story. Nevertheless, the deed is done, and Naroshs Koal should be pleased.","Indeed, Naroshs Koal is very pleased by the quality of the liver you have brought. He asks that you hold on to it for now and present it to Xeroshs Ooan, who will inspect it and see it delivered to the clutchmother.","As before, you are not permitted to intrude upon the sanctity of the clutchmother's chamber.
