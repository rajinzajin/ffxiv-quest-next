The words of Ramuh appear to resonate with Kan–E–Senna, and she is unable to refute the Lord of Levin's claim that wherever man wanders, darkness follows closely behind. You exit the Lotus Stand at the conclusion to your audience, leaving Gridania's leader troubled and thoughtful despite the news of your victory. Report the details of your meeting to Papalymo who awaits you at Nophica's Altar.","Unlike the Elder Seedseer, Papalymo appears satisfied with the outcome. Return to the Rising Stones and report to Minfilia.","After listening to your report, Minfilia alludes to some news of her own. Before divulging anything more, however, the Antecedent suggests you first listen to Urianger's latest discovery concerning the nature of the Ascians' immortality.
