Upon hearing the news, I was inspired to open a tavern in the Anvil, to give Lakelanders libations the likes of which few have tasted, while also making our coinpurses heavy with profit."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"We've been brewing our unique brand of booze and using the gil we've earned to help fund work on the Rolling Tankards. Some might say it would be downright irresponsible to use a precious resource in the pursuit of coin, but I say to them in return: bah! Besides, a full treasury would surely suit our purposes better than an empty one, wouldn't you say?"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Of course you agree! That's why I've chosen none other than you to aid Girutt in improving our budding tavern! Go speak with him─I believe you'll find him most amenable."},{"name":"GIRUTT","text":"So you're the one Regitt is so keen on, are you? Well, take these and earn your keep, then."},{"name":"GIRUTT","text":"A proper drink needs a proper mixin', and for that not just any old cup will do. It has to be done right, and if you're as good a metalsmith as they say, I reckon you'll get it on your first try. If you're not as good as they say, Ronitt's automaton is here with whatever you need."},{"name":"GIRUTT","text":"A proper drink needs a proper tankard, and for our tavern only the best will do. It has to be done right, and if you're as good with your hands as they say, I reckon you'll get it on your first try. If you're not as good as they say, Ronitt's automaton is here with whatever you need."},{"name":"GIRUTT","text":"We don't mean to serve just any grog here. It has to be the best, and if your sense of taste is as keen as they say, I reckon you can whip up just the flavorings we need on the first try. If you're not as good as they say, Ronitt's automaton is here with whatever you need."},{"name":"GIRUTT","text":"Once you're done, bring it here and we'll see if you live up to your reputation."},{"name":"AUTOMATON03915","text":"&lt;beep&gt; Materials detected.

Well, give it here."},{"name":"GIRUTT","text":"Wha─!?<br>This is...words fail me! Give me a moment to gather my thoughts here...<br>Ahem. Well done. Needless to say, you met my every expectation, and a few more besides. This is the very embodiment of the quality we strive for at Luca's Locket!"},{"name":"GIRUTT","text":"I believe Regitt will be overjoyed to see what you've wrought as well. So overjoyed, in fact, that I sense a generous reward is in your future."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Back already! I take it Girutt was the kind and sensible taskmaster he always is."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"The nature of our work here is boom and bust, and it will serve us well to have an alternate stream of gil to ride through the lean times."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Speaking of which, this is for you. An honest wage for an honest day's work. I hope it's enough to entice you to help us once again, should the need arise."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Luca's Locket is now open for business!
