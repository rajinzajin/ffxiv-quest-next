I crawled into this comfy looking pot for a nice nap, and before I knew it, I was whisked away on an adventure!"},{"name":"NAMAZU04189","text":"(-Voice from the Pot-)Wait! Before you spill me out, would you mind pouring in a generous splash of water? I couldn't bear for anyone to see me so dried out, no, no!"},{"name":"NAMAZU04189","text":"(-Voice from the Pot-)Oho, very funny.
