I could use your help with something."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"You see, I was asked to assess a one-eyed giant created as a facility guard, and so pit it against a lotis to test its fighting skills."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"Not only did the giant fall to a single blow, the lotis went into a frenzy and escaped..."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"In my opinion, compact familiars like you are far more effective than these overly large brutes, and this is my chance to prove it. Do you think you can handle our runaway combatant?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"So long as there's something in it for me."},{"name":"A1","text":"Fine, I'll help."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"Of course you'll be well rewarded for your efforts.

It would seem the escaped lotis came back of its own accord."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"They usually feed off their foes to revitalize themselves, and I imagine it hungers after running amok like that."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"I'll take care of the situation here. The lotis is all yours."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"Don't worry about me.

I had a feeling I could count on you."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"As for the giant, it's far too heavy for us to move. I'll arrange for some broad-backed creations to haul it away after we return to Poieten Oikos."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"As I suspected, a smaller, more agile concept has far more facility for adapting to combat situations. Thank you for proving my theory."},{"name":"OBSERVER04296","text":"I'll be sure to keep your performance in mind the next time I design a familiar.
