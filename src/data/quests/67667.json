She explains that it is a tallying game in three rounds with different levels of difficulty, and should you clear them all, you will receive a prize. Head over to the beginner eggsaminer to begin the game.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","The beginner eggsaminer provides you with further details for the activity before letting loose a handful of spriggans who scamper between the partitions. As you have confidently counted their eggs with ease, head over to the intermediate eggsaminer for a more respectable challenge.","The intermediate eggsaminer adds another egg design to the mix and more spriggans to the fray, but your impeccable memory has again reigned supreme. Head over to the advanced eggsaminer for the final round.","Although your focus falters slightly under the advanced eggsaminer's intimidating personality, you were able to steel yourself and pick out every egg. Return to Motte and inform her you have successfully completed all three rounds.","Motte is amazed by your egg counting abilities, confessing even she was unable to pass the advanced round. Speak to her again should you feel the pressing need to count your eggs before they hatch."],"objectives":["Speak with the beginner eggsaminer.","Speak with the intermediate eggsaminer.","Speak with the advanced eggsaminer.","Report to Motte."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOTTE","text":"Hello there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Do you see those colorful partitions in front of the amphitheatre? I painted them myself for the Spriggan Scramble! Surely you'll indulge me and play it?"},{"name":"MOTTE","text":"It's a tallying game. You will need to use your keen observation to count how many eggs were carried by a group of scampering spriggans."},{"name":"MOTTE","text":"There are three degrees of difficulty─beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Once you complete a round, you must proceed to the next until you have successfully challenged all three. When you have done so, return to me and I will reward you with a prize. Good luck!"},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"Considering how quickly you blazed through the beginner's step, I would say you are ready to speak to the handsome-looking lad down the road."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFD02131","text":"You're done with this round, so go and speak with the eggsaminer across from the amphitheatre. Though I warn you, my fellow Dreamer takes her egg counting very seriously."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFF02131","text":"I underestimated your skill at spotting spriggans, adventurer. Have you considered becoming a Dreamer? Spending day after day, training and chasing the little dust bunnies around the meadows. Think of the possibilities."},{"name":"MOTTE","text":"I'll be right here watching you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Good luck!"},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"Ah, a challenger appears! Well met, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"Did Motte explain this activity to you? Between these plank boards will be five spriggans. Each spriggan will be carrying an expertly embellished egg. For this round, the eggs will have only two motifs."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"Be sure to pay close attention! After the spriggans finish their scramble, I will ask you to tell me how many of each you saw. If you are correct, I will send you off to the next round."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"But first, I must make sure you are properly acquainted with the designs."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"A pristine white egg looks like this..."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"...and a vibrant blue egg looks like this!"},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"Well, then. Are you ready? Release the spriggans!"},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFC02131","text":"Did any slip past you, I wonder?

But I'm afraid that is incorrect. Spriggans are quick, so keep your eyes on their prize. Feel free to take the challenge again."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFD02131","text":"Passed the beginner's round, did you? Although we both know it is not necessarily a feat. How's about we raise the bar a bit higher, eh?"},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFD02131","text":"In this round, six sprightly spriggans will carry eggs decorated with three different designs."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFD02131","text":"If you have properly warmed up, then we shall commence with the counting."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFD02131","text":"Ah yes, I nearly forgot.

Quite a sharp memory you have there, adventurer!

Too bad. The good news is you can always try again. I'll be waiting."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFF02131","text":"Judging by your smug look of satisfaction, it appears you have cleared the intermediate round. Well, counting on your fingers won't save you this time, adventurer."},{"name":"EGGHUNTINGSTAFFF02131","text":"There will be no mercy in this round.
