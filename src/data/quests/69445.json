Would that I could say the same for myself. My scouts have recently spotted a suspicious figure skulking about, doubtless looking for an opportunity to abscond with our precious metals."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Make no mistake, if that scoundrel dares to step foot in my workshop, I won't hesitate to take my hammer and give whoever─or whatever─it is a walloping they won't soon forget, but I must admit I don't savor the thought of doing so. My talents lie in crafting, not combat. "},{"name":"REGITT","text":"You, however, are artisan and warrior both! I would ask you to patrol the area where the suspect was last sighted, and if you spot anyone, greet them with a hearty lali-ho. I pray you're able to resolve this matter with words, but if they should prove hostile, well...I'll pray for your safe return!"},{"name":"ELF03909","text":"And just who the hells are you, eh? Quite the unsavory type, and believe me, I would know. Stay well away if you know what's good for you."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase containing the word “lali-ho” to greet the Nightshade elf."},{"name":"ELF03909","text":"You...you're in league with those sodding dwarves! Well, you go back to your masters and tell them one thing: Lakeland belongs to the elves─every ilm of it!"},{"name":"GUARD03909","text":"Well, well, I didn't expect to see the bleedin' hero of the realm on today of all days! To what do I owe the honor?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase containing the word “lali-ho” to greet the vigilant guard."},{"name":"GUARD03909","text":"Oh, I know that one! That's what them dwarves over at the Anvil say, innit? A few of them came down this way and hailed me with those selfsame words."},{"name":"GUARD03909","text":"Lali-ho! Heh heh...<br>Well, wherever you're headed, stay out of trouble, yeah?"},{"name":"GREMLIN03909","text":"Lali-ho! Ho ho!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase containing the word “lali-ho” to greet the wayward gremlin."},{"name":"GREMLIN03909","text":"Lali-ho! Lali-ho, lali-ho! Ho ho ho!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The gremlin mimics the greeting repeatedly, looking quite pleased with itself as it scampers away."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Who─ Who's that!?<br>Oh, it's you, at last! Well, what did you find out about this intruder?"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Phew, you couldn't have come with better news. Truth be told, I practically soiled myself just imagining what I might have to do with this hammer if something surly were to come this way. Out of pity for them, of course, not fear for myself!"},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Regardless, I'm glad we had you to check up on things for us. Always prepare for the worst, eh? Speaking of which, if any other suspicious fellows wander near the Anvil, I trust I can count on you once more."},{"name":"SAYTODO","text":"lali-ho"}],"reward":{"gil":606,"reputation":60,"items":[{"id":28188}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":4,"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":33}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1033712","obj":{"i":1033712,"n":"Regitt","l":2953,"q":28}},{"type":"item","id":"28188","obj":{"i":28188,"n":"Hammered Frogment","l":1,"c":65080,"t":100}}]}
