Upon further inquiry, you discover that her demand stems from a desire to allow Lisette time with her own beloved during this season of romance. After you pledge your support to Astrid, Lisette finally consents to her younger sister's wishes, counseling her to stay true to her heart as she fulfills her duty as an emissary of affection.<br><br>Now wearing her sister's proverbial shoes, Astrid asks you to accompany her colleague, an emissary-in-training named Emilie, on a promotional tour around Gridania. You speak to Emilie to get started, but not before you take note of the cheerful determination on Astrid's face─and her uncharacteristically frilly outfit. <br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You and Emilie set off towards the Leatherworkers' Guild to begin your advertising campaign. The lilt of a haltingly improvised love poem tells you Astrid is also hard at work.<br><br>※You must be accompanied by Emilie to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated.","You managed to snag the interest of a Gridanian resident with your enthusiastic pitch. Next, Emilie suggests you head towards the Shaded Bower.","You secure another participant for the festivities, but Emilie seems somewhat thrown by his compliment. Shaking off her reaction, she proclaims the Centaur's Eye as your next destination.","Emilie successfully invites another potential merrymaker, but in the next breath confesses her uneasiness towards her own state of dress. In truth, she admits, she would rather wear something “adorable” rather than “handsome,” but felt it her supporting duty to contrast Lady Astrid's attire. After encouraging her to share her true feelings with Astrid, you part ways for a time to let Emilie gather her thoughts.","You meet Emilie back at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre only to find Lady Astrid looking rather bedraggled. Apparently, receiving the attentions inspired of her “adorable” outfit has been exhausting, and yet she feels it is her duty as Lady Lisette's successor to weather it nonetheless. Emilie takes this chance to admit her own discomfort, and you both urge Astrid to consider that love of one's natural preferences is as worthy a love as any other. Astrid is bolstered by your encouragement and vows to become the sort of emissary she is best suited to become─after changing into a suit herself, that is. Exchanging outfits, Astrid and Emilie continue facilitating this year's Valentione's Day celebrations with undeniable and radiant confidence."],"objectives":["Speak with Emilie and have her accompany you.","Speak with Gridanian residents while accompanied by Emilie.","Speak with Gridanian residents while accompanied by Emilie again.","Speak with Gridanian residents while accompanied by Emilie yet again.","Speak with Emilie."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LISETTE","text":"As dawnlight kisses sky above,<br>So too eternal beams my love.<br>Though dusk may drown the world in grey,<br>The night shall taste─<br>...Why, hello there!"},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"If it isn't my hero of zeal, my champion of cherishers!

Er...weak with, I mean!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"...Oh, who am I fooling? The truth is, people have been bombarding me with compliments on my appearance. Every second person says that I look “sweet” or “adorable,” and it's been positively exhausting."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"As a daughter of nobility, I know I ought to desire such praise─beauty and grace are highly commendable virtues in our circles, after all."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"But one day, I met a knight─a fellow daughter of a noble house─and I found myself drawn to her strength and gallantry."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Our famous ancestor Countess Arabelle was also a skilled warrior, you know. Alas, I've never had the physical disposition for such a rigorous calling."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"And though I find comfort in incorporating the spirit of chivalry into my guise and mannerism, if I'm to be an emissary worthy of succeeding Lisette, I must accept the attire that comes with the position, and set aside my own preferences."},{"name":"Q4","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A4","text":"Emilie would be happy to trade outfits with you!"},{"name":"A4","text":"Embracing one's own preferences is also an expression of love─<span class=\"emphasis\">self</span>-love."},{"name":"EMILIE","text":"Uwaaah! Wh-What are you doing!? M-My thoughts─must gather my thoughts!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"It may be said that to prefer is to love. Still, as an emissary, I can't allow my personal concerns to interfere with duty."},{"name":"EMILIE","text":"...Ahem. Astrid. I know your feelings all too well...for I have them too, though in reverse to you."},{"name":"EMILIE","text":"I find it uplifting to be called “sweet” or “adorable.” Yet I feel anything but in this “handsome” suit..."},{"name":"EMILIE","text":"As emissaries of love, our duty is to help people embrace their hearts. But how are we to do this if we don't embrace our own? If we don't love ourselves and pursue our own happiness?"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"You're right, Emilie. You're absolutely right."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"There I was, chiding Lisette for ignoring her own happiness. Yet here I am, guilty of doing the very same thing..."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"In order to become a great emissary like my sister, I had believed that I needed to emulate her completely. But that isn't the case."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"No, as my sister herself advised, I need to stay true to my heart."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Only then can I hope to become the best emissary that I can be!"},{"name":"EMILIE","text":"Were it not for your encouragement, Astrid and I might have continued to be miserable, trying to be someone we're not.
