Equip your new scepter and speak with Cocobuki once more."],"objectives":["Speak with Cocobygo."],"dialogue":[{"name":"YAYAKE","text":"Well, adventurer? Will you join our guild, or do you presume to ignore the urgings of impatient destiny?"},{"name":"YAYAKE","text":"A wise decision, indeed. To prepare for your initiation, I would have you study the volumes of fundamental thaumaturgical principle. All one hundred and eight of them."},{"name":"YAYAKE","text":"...Or at least, I <span class=\"emphasis\">would</span> if such requirements had not been abolished. “Too great a deterrent to fresh novices,” they said. I suppose you shall just have to settle for calling upon the collective wisdom of our guildmasters."},{"name":"YAYAKE","text":"We have five, you see─all brothers of the same house. Though they all wield supreme authority, it is the eldest who provides a singular voice for the guild when one is required. Master Coco... Cocoby...? Cocobygo! ...I believe."},{"name":"YAYAKE","text":"You choose to close your eyes to fate's beckoning hand? Very well, but you cannot avoid this path forever. Sooner or later, your steps will bring you back to the Ossuary...and our guild."},{"name":"COCOBYGO","text":"Who!? What!? Oh.

She can recite the three hundred and seven verses of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Funerary Rites for the Virtuous Fallen</span>, but the simple task of keeping our names straight seems ever beyond her grasp."},{"name":"COCOBOHA","text":"Bwahahahaha! Well, I for one find the constant confusion endlessly entertaining! My apologies, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">my dear</span><span class=\"alternative\">good sir</span></span>, my merriment was not meant to mock your mistake. It is our sibling Coco<span class=\"emphasis\">buki</span> with whom you should speak."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"What's this, what's this? Thal has led to us a new aspirant?"},{"name":"COCOBYGO","text":"Aaah! Cocobuki! Were you here the entire time!?"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Greetings, child. I am Cocobuki, the eldest─and, I would venture to say, the wisest─of the five masters of the Thaumaturges' Guild. It is my solemn duty to furnish our would-be initiates with a succinct understanding of our beloved art, thus I would have your fullest attention."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"To wield thaumaturgy is to unleash devastation of the highest magnitude.

Of course, such power has a price. You must be willing to plunge headfirst into the forbidding chasm of thaumaturgy's secrets─for advancement in this art comes only with the completion of deadly and terrible trials."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"I ask you now, aspirant: are you prepared to leap into the abyss in pursuit of power unrivaled?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"Are you prepared to leap into the abyss?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Yes"},{"name":"A2","text":"No"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Hm hm hm... A confident response. Your name, if you will? Very well, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, let us mark your initiation with three eminently practical gifts."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"My first gift to you shall be an addition to your hunting log─the names of such enemies that will prove suitable to your training as a thaumaturge."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"The second and third gifts are this scepter and shield─instruments you shall need to focus the destructive force of your will."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Did you believe your initiation over? My dear disciple, we have only just begun. Take your new weapons in hand, and I will set you forth upon your first trial..."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Have my words lodged a splinter of fear in your mind?
