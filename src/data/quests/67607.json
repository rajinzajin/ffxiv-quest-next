I believe it is time we began working on Madam Peak's music box."},{"name":"MARCEL","text":"I have taken the liberty of choosing the song myself. It is a piece of particular sentimental value to my client and her dear husband─and one of the finest pieces from the Songstress's repertoire, if I do say so myself."},{"name":"MARCEL","text":"As for what physical form the music box is to take, that is for the artisan to decide. I suggest you begin by speaking with our client yourself. Worry not─I have already made the necessary arrangements. She awaits you at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange."},{"name":"MARCEL","text":"Jeweled Peak awaits you at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange. Now go, and be quick about it─let it not be said that Eshtaime's keeps their clients waiting."},{"name":"JEWELEDPEAK","text":"You are the goldsmith who will be crafting my music box, yes? Marcel has told me all about you. My expectations are high, but I trust you would not have been chosen for the task were you not capable of meeting them."},{"name":"JEWELEDPEAK","text":"Yes, I can scarcely wait to see what manner of extravagant masterpiece you will create for me.

Oh, but look at the time! I'm afraid I must be off. Do give my regards to Marcel."},{"name":"MARCEL","text":"A music box of the purest gold, adorned with a great ruby and sapphire... Sturdy enough to be played each day and yet still last as an heirloom to be passed down through generations... Why, that is so exceptionally inspired it's a wonder that I wasn't the one who thought of it!"},{"name":"MARCEL","text":"As the music box itself will be quite large, we will require stones of impressive size to match. It will be no small task to see that all elements─gold and gemstone alike─are balanced, complementing each other and achieving perfect harmony."},{"name":"MARCEL","text":"Before commencing work on our client's piece, you would do well to hone your skills by crafting a piece requiring similar materials and techniques."},{"name":"MARCEL","text":"Let me see... Why yes, a hardsilver bangle of casting might very well suffice.

Show it to me and I will evaluate the quality of your work."},{"name":"MARCEL","text":"By Thal! I have seen many a bangle in my day, but never one that exuded such grace!
