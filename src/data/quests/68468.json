Your opponent is a being known as Exdeath, who commands the power of the void. Like Halicarnassus before him, he is apparently the defeated antagonist of an age-old folktale. It is at this moment that Cid finally gives voice to his earlier quandary: why did Omega choose the vanquished instead of the vanquishers? Before you can contemplate the question, Cid receives a call from Biggs and Wedge, who report that they have been unable to repair the stasis system. And so it is decided that you must continue with Omega's experiment, at least for the time being. As always, Alpha is ready to proceed when you are.<br><br>※In the event that you leave the Interdimensional Rift, you may re-enter by speaking with the Ironworks hand at the Yawn.","In but three kwehs, Alpha expresses his determination to settle matters in the Deltascape. Fixing your gaze upon the nearby portal, you gird yourself for the coming trial.<br><br>※Deltascape V4.0 can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","Exdeath proves to be a fearsome foe, but following in the footsteps of the tale's heroes, you succeed in vanquishing him. In the wake of the battle, your comrades join you in the Deltascape, which is the Deltascape no more, having been summarily shut down by Omega, its purpose served. After congratulating you on your victory, your host bids you rest while you await the next call, and you are glad of the opportunity to leave the rift behind.","You find yourself back on the surface at the Yawn, your companions gathered nearby.","Cid thanks you for the pivotal role you have played in advancing the investigation. Though there are many and more battles to come, you have taken a momentous step towards solving the mystery that is Omega, and may now enjoy some well-earned respite."],"objectives":["Speak with Alpha.","Enter Deltascape V4.0.","Speak with Cid."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALPHA","text":"Kw...kwibbit?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"So that was Halicarnassus.

But I am quite sure Omega will have interpreted it as something more tangible."},{"name":"NERO","text":"Alas, no amount of analysis can tell us what may happen when Exdeath calls upon the power of the void. Which is to say: beware."},{"name":"CID","text":"Tell me something, Nero. What happens at the end of the tale?"},{"name":"NERO","text":"Why, good triumphs over evil and the heroes defeat Exdeath, of course. What did you expect?"},{"name":"CID","text":"I expected exactly that, which is precisely what troubled me earlier. If the heroes won, why did Omega not make them its test subjects?"},{"name":"CID","text":"If it seeks to determine the strongest being, why would it bother with those who were defeated?"},{"name":"CID","text":"One moment─linkpearl. ...Ah, Biggs.

That was Biggs."},{"name":"CID","text":"He reports that the stasis system shows every sign of being engaged, despite the fact that it clearly isn't."},{"name":"CID","text":"It can only be a malfunction. While we were able to turn it off, it would seem the reverse is not possible."},{"name":"NERO","text":"The system may have taken damage during the Calamity.

While they may be able to fix it, there's no telling how long it might take."},{"name":"NERO","text":"Well then, we must keep on fighting the good fight here, must we not?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Nero has the right of it.

'Tis not unlike the nothingness that Emperor Xande sought in the Crystal Tower."},{"name":"CID","text":"To desire nothingness is to deny life, yet life seeks to endure─to perpetuate itself.
