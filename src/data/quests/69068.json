Of course, they do not tell their customers where the crystals come from, but I know their secret."},{"name":"MOLDWARRIOR03532","text":"That is why I am here, to bring them to justice. Breaking our code, selling under false pretenses. Very serious crimes!"},{"name":"MOLDWARRIOR03532","text":"I have tracked them this far and they will soon be mine!

They got what they deserved for spitting on our code!"},{"name":"MOLDWARRIOR03532","text":"Whether the Wall's crystals have anything to do with sin eaters is not for me to say.
