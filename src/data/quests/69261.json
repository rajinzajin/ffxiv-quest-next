Likely on account of this, Francel is late to return from his efforts to bring people to the new district, and you are tasked with tracking the young lord down in the Brume.","You find Francel struggling to convince citizens to move to the Firmament. With some well-chosen words, however, you help him to secure two new residentsâ”€a woman named Audaine and her daughter, Noalle. Having witnessed firsthand the trust people harbor for you, Francel begs for your continued assistance in running the fledgling district.","You agree to assist Francel, who expresses his profound gratitude. Without further ado, he tasks you with delivering three missives, which he explains are entreaties for cooperation in the restoration effort. The recipients are Gibrillont, the proprietor of the Forgotten Knight; Ser Handeloup, second commander of the Temple Knights; and Elaisse, the master of the Ishgardian markets.","You have delivered the missives and received positive responses from all three recipients; Gibrillont is happy to provide meals, Ser Handeloup will speak in favor of dispatching the Temple Knights' engineers, and Elaisse will personally work to procure the heavy machinery sought. Your task accomplished, you head to the Firmament to report to Francel.","You arrive in the Mendicant's Court and rejoin Francel, who is eager to learn how the three recipients responded to his entreaties."],"objectives":["Speak with Francel in the Brume.","Speak with Francel again.","Deliver Francel's missive to Gibrillont.","Deliver Francel's missive to Handeloup.","Deliver Francel's missive to Elaisse.","Report to Francel in the Firmament."],"dialogue":[{"name":"FONCRINEAU","text":"Ah, if it isn't good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"FONCRINEAU","text":"Though you may have seen me attending Lord Francel, I've not had the pleasure of introducing myself.

About that..."},{"name":"FONCRINEAU","text":"Master Augebert. By your tone, I take it you harbor some concerns."},{"name":"AUGEBERT","text":"Aye, that I do. Thanks to Francel's encouragement, some folk have already moved into the district, but many more are draggin' their feet."},{"name":"AUGEBERT","text":"To hear the talk, they're afraid that the rent will be too expensive, or that they'll put themselves at the mercy of heartless nobles, and a whole host of other reasons."},{"name":"FONCRINEAU","text":"In order to encourage settlement, the Firmament offers various incentives to residents, such as tax relief and employment initiatives. Mayhap this knowledge has not been sufficiently disseminated to the public."},{"name":"AUGEBERT","text":"My thought exactly. That he's late to return is because he's strugglin' to win folk over, I'd wager."},{"name":"AUGEBERT","text":"On that note, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I was wonderin' if you'd mind searchin' for him, see how he's farin'."},{"name":"FONCRINEAU","text":"I too would be grateful were you to look in on my lord.

'Tis the product of your many selfless deeds."},{"name":"FRANCEL","text":"Despite being falsely accused of a crime and driven to the ends of the realm, you did not surrender to despair.
