Perhaps you should intervene.","Silvairre reveals that he has discovered the whereabouts of Pawah Mujuuk, before rushing off alone to apprehend her. Follow him to the South Shroud and see that he comes to no harm.","You find Silvairre surrounded by the bodies of an unknown gang of poachers, exhausted but unharmed. After you dispatch a pursuing party of assailants, the Elezen explains his plan to lure Pawah out of hiding. Make your way to the specified clearing and use the bone whistle Silvairre has given you to summon Pawah and her gang.","After a fierce battle, the three of you successfully subdue Pawah and consign her infamous gang to history. Return to the Archers' Guild and share the tale of your triumph with Luciane.","Luciane is glad of your safe return, and proud to have such a dedicated and compassionate adventurer in her ranks.
