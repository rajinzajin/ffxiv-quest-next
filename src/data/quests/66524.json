Investigate two sites in the remains of Camp Revenant's Toll, and do away with any bothersome nixes that appear.","What happens when you hit nixes with sharp metal objects? The same thing that happens to everything else. Return to Npah Tayuun and let her know of your bloody deeds.","Someday, you will meet a scholar who does not rejoice at the violent death of a foe, but today is not that day.
