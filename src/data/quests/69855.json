Busy as she is, she wanted to let me know that she's patched things up with her father. I'm truly happy for her."},{"name":"DICKON","text":"But speaking of busy...we're quite short on hands this shift. As much as I'd hate to bother you, could you deliver an order for me?"},{"name":"DICKON","text":"It's a pair of salad sandwiches for an elderly gentleman at Auk's Landing. He's a Lalafell with a distinguished air, so you can't miss him. My thanks in advance."},{"name":"DICKON","text":"Please deliver the salad sandwiches to the elderly gentleman at Auk's Landing. He's a Lalafell with a distinguished air, so you can't miss him. My thanks in advance."},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"Oh, you are one of the Scions, are you not? <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I believe. 'Tis a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Now, what might I do for you?"},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"Ah, the sandwiches! How very kind of you to bring them. The Last Stand serves up many scrumptious dishes, but their sandwiches have always been my favorite. My son, meanwhile, was partial to the pretzels."},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"...When I was young, I attended the Studium. Louisoix was a classmate of mine─a kindred spirit in the study of magic─and we inspired each other to greater heights."},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"After I completed my studies, I continued conducting research and eventually became a professor. I married and had a family. Settled down."},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"Such a life wasn't for Louisoix, who was on the road more often than not. My son grew to admire him, and went to become his pupil and earn his Archon's mark."},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"To see him set forth to fight for Eorzea beside Louisoix filled me with pride. Yet so too did I worry, as any parent would."},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"In the end, he gave his life for his cause, so strongly did he believe in it. And having now seen his comrades fighting tirelessly to protect our star, I have come to understand whence came his conviction."},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"...Ah, but listen to me blathering on. I know you are a busy <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span>, so I shall let you go."},{"name":"LALAFELLGENTLEMAN04319","text":"Thank you. Not only for the sandwich, but also for standing with my son to the last."},{"name":"DICKON","text":"Ah, you're back. Did you have a chat with the customer?"},{"name":"DICKON","text":"Wonderful. The gentleman's a regular of ours, you see. When he heard that the Scions had come to Sharlayan, he was beside himself with excitement. He dearly wanted to meet you, but wasn't sure how to go about it."},{"name":"DICKON","text":"So when you appeared when you did, well, I thought I'd make it happen. I appreciate you going along with it."},{"name":"DICKON","text":"By way of thanks, here's a little something on the house.
