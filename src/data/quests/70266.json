Hearing this, you are not terribly surprised to discover that the artisan who arrives soon after is the same Grenoldt you encountered in the depths of the Tempest. Grenoldt has judged that the time is right for him to rejoin society, and invites you to come along as he seeks to pair his veteran experience with the untapped potential of a new generation of craftspeople─namely, the promising Chora-Zoi.","You accompany Grenoldt as he reunites with old acquaintances in the Mean, and are subsequently treated to an awkward display of mutual adoration. Reignited romance with Mistress Mowen aside, it is decided that the seasoned craftsman will guide the young Chora-Zoi in her endeavor to create a new line of artisan tools─an undertaking in which your participation is highly encouraged. Katliss, the one who volunteered your assistance, has kindly provided a place for the three of you to work in the form of a nearby stall.","Chora-Zoi explains the difficulty she faces in producing original works, and so Grenoldt suggests she begin her search for innovation by using his old tools as a base. Although intimidated by the thought of improving on such masterpieces, Grenoldt's steady advice and Mowen's proffered mercantile support is enough to convince the young artisan to begin crafting her own “splendorous tools.” Your role in this project, however, has yet to be fully explained..."],"objectives":["Speak with Grenoldt.","Speak with Grenoldt again."],"dialogue":[{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Excuse me! You're the Warrior of Darkness, aren't you!? My name is Chora-Zoi, and I work for the Facet of Forging."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"I apologize for interrupting your day, but seeing as you're said to be a practiced artisan, I thought you might be interested to hear the news!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"A craftsman of legendary reputation is coming home to the Crystarium! He's long been away, living somewhere in the wilds that he might focus on mastering his trade without worldly distractions..."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"But now that night is returned to the realm, he felt it time to return. As a matter of fact, he's due to arrive any moment now. Ah, to think that I shall soon meet one of my greatest inspirations!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"&lt;gasp&gt; Over there... I think that's him!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"M-M-Master Grenoldt...?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Aye, that'd be me. Ye must be the young artisan I was told would be waitin'. Chora-Zoi, was it?"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Y-Yes, sir! It is <span class=\"emphasis\">such</span> an honor!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"An' <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, wasn't expectin' to see ye here! Ye've been keepin' well, I hope?"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Hold on... The two of you know each other!?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Aye, came to visit me workshop in the depths o' the bloody Tempest, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> did.

I was set on asking you to be my mentor, but to simply meet you is already a dream come true!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Now, now, lass, I ain't worthy o' such an earnest young craftswoman's admiration. I was a sad shadow of a man, hidin' away in a watery tomb."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"'Twas only when <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> came along that I was forced to realize how much me work relied on the people I tried to leave behind. Then I got to thinkin' I should pair up with the up-an'-comin' talent─ye know, get meself a fresh perspective."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"I sent a letter sayin' as much to me ol' mates in the Mean, an' they told me of a promisin' artisan who'd shown an interest in me craft. So I took that as the sign I needed to get me sorry arse back home."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"You mean me!? <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> was the sign!? You won't regret this, Master Grenoldt, I promise!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Shall we make our way straight to the Mean? Katliss and the others are eager to see you."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Havin' ye show up in this moment is some kind o' fate, I reckon. Why don't ye come along, an' we can make it one big reunion?"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"I wholeheartedly agree! Please come with us, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"It's been nigh on a decade since Master Grenoldt was last in the Crystarium. I can't imagine what he must be feeling."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Well, ain't this a sight for sore eyes... Those iron girders. Those elegant domes. Gazin' up at that architecture as a sprat is what got me into the trade in the first place."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Ahhh, so the city itself was your original source of inspiration! You must have some wonderful stories─I can hardly wait to hear them all!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Isn't that Mistress Mowen?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Mistress Mowen! Speakin' of a sight for sore eyes... Surely ye've not come into town on account o' little ol' me?"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"But of course I did. Many's the evening I spent on Eulmore's terrace, gazing into the distance and thinking fondly of my rough-spoken smith."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Uh, ahem... I should explain."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"I owe a great debt to Mistress Mowen here. If she hadn't believed in me─enough to promote me wares all over Norvrandt─then I reckon I'd never have made it as an artisan."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"As it turns out, I found me muse in them enchantin' eyes. The thousands of kettles I forged to capture that captivating gleam was what set me on the smitty's path!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"This one I inscribed with a mark I saw in a dream...an' it's become the symbol o' me good fortune─the embodiment of all me aspirations."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Without ye, Mistress Mowen, I wouldn't be the craftsman I am today. I hope the fool who spent so many years honin' his skills under the ocean is still one ye can be proud of..."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"You great oaf, 'tis I who was enchanted─by your craft, and by your unyielding discipline. In emulating those admirable values was I able to build my commercial empire!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Ahem! So! Master Grenoldt, did you have anything in particular you were wanting to forge? Some overarching plan or direction in mind?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"That was to be me question to ye, Chora-Zoi. Afore we begin, I need to know: what's the thing ye daydream about craftin' the most?"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Well, I... I suppose I've always liked the idea of a tool which “attunes” itself to the artisan who holds it. But I could never settle on a design..."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Forget the finer details for now─the seed o' yer idea is all we need to get underway. Just hop on the craftin' cart with me, an' we'll see where it takes us!"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"How wonderful! Being the sort of veteran craftsman who takes on a disciple was something you always wished for, was it not?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Ye...remember that? Feels like an age since we spoke of it."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"A new era has begun. Norvrandt is emerging from a hundred years of torpor, and the tools you invent will help shape the world it becomes."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"As chairwoman of the Boutique of Splendors, I consider it my duty to nurture the artisans of today and tomorrow. Whatever you decide to do, I pledge my full support."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"Might I suggest you have <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> lend a hand? I can personally vouch for <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> skill, and I'm certain whatever tool you end up crafting will benefit from <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> involvement."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"I'll not say nay to that! With Chora-Zoi's potential an' yer proven talent, I'll be in fine company!"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"Having the Warrior's name attached to your project will add more than simple prestige─we could be watching the birth of something truly historical. As a merchant, I can think of no greater honor or opportunity than to be part of this undertaking."},{"name":"KATLISS","text":"You'll need a place to work, I assume? We've set up a stall just outside the Mean, so feel free to make yourself at home for as long as you decide to stay."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Sounds perfect─I do like the idea of bein' in earshot o' the hustle an' bustle. Let's see about gettin' me tools unpacked, shall we?"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Master Grenoldt's Crystarium workbench! Imagine the wonders that will be made here!"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"I am reminded of the early days of my boutique─of the trips I would make to collect Grenoldt's latest creations to take to the market. Those are some of my fondest memories..."},{"name":"QUINNANA","text":"I cannot recall when I last saw Mistress Mowen so full of joy. Even on the road here from Eulmore, she seemed, well, a little giddy, to be honest."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"I've got a Crystarium furnace in my Tempest workshop, so I'm well familiar with the facilities here in town."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Any refinin' or smeltin' can be done at the Facet of Forging, an' this place'll serve as me workbench."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"One thing, Miss Chora-Zoi: do ye have much experience in craftin' original pieces?"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Practically none at all, I'm ashamed to say. I have something of a knack for making replicas, but when it comes to new ideas, I find myself being overwhelmed by the possibilities."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"An' so ye stick to what ye know, eh? Hrm."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"How about we try this, then? Ye take some o' me old tools as a base, an' see what improvements ye can add to make 'em yer own."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"I have a set right here ye can work on."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Y-You mean, the tools you made yourself!? The same tools lauded by master artisans in every corner of Norvrandt!? I must have filled a hundred orders making duplicates of your designs!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Aye, they were right popular for a time there. Afore I took up the hermit's life, I was stuck craftin' them dawn till dusk─even had a nightmare I was trapped, slavin' away at me forge until me bloody hair fell out."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"But...but they're <span class=\"emphasis\">masterpieces</span>! What could I possibly do to improve upon them?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Don't take it so seriously, for starters. Play around a bit, tweak a few measurements, an' that'll soon give ye a feel for what is an' ain't possible."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"Ah, such fond memories. Grenoldt was buried beneath unfinished tools, I was drowning in purchase receipts, and the orders just kept flooding in..."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Mistress Mowen, no!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Apologies, I didn't mean to─ Ye'll get tool grease all over them clean hands o' yers, is all."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"'Tis I who should apologize! One careless move, and I might have ruined your project before it even began..."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"It's fine, everythin's fine! Yer touch could never ruin anythin'!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Ahem. If I rack the ol' noggin, it shouldn't take long to sketch out some plans for evolvin' the original tool designs. Ye'll be the one doin' the actual improvements, so feel free to draw on 'em or make whatever adjustments ye like."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"And whatever materials you require, the Boutique will procure it, no matter the rarity!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Me dear lady, I've not the words to thank ye for yer generous assistance..."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"I've just had the most wonderful idea! We'll need a name for our new creations, and what better way to show our gratitude to the Boutique than to dub them “splendorous tools”!?"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"'Tis a lovely gesture, Miss Chora-Zoi! But a merchant's role is simply to ensure that the artisan has her choice of creative clay. 'Twould be presumptuous in the extreme to have my establishment take center stage when the genius is all yours."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"That quiet dignity and dedication is exactly why I'd be proud to have you and your business represent us! If it helps, think of it as commemorating your reunion with Master Grenoldt!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Now this is just gettin' awkward... What do ye think, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Dignity and dedication sound like fine virtues to be associated with."},{"name":"A2","text":"I think it's just <span class=\"emphasis\">perfect</span>."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"In that case, I shall work doubly hard to fulfill my promise of support. May your splendorous tools be instrumental in crafting the marvels of this new age!"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"You have everything you need to begin, I hope? I have instructed Quinnana to serve you as the Boutique's representative, but rest assured that I shall return anon to check on your progress."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"I'll get to explainin' me plans in a bit, but for now, we'll leave the base tool with ye, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Katliss says yer qualified to be our test <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">tradeswoman</span><span class=\"alternative\">tradesman</span></span>, an' that's good enough for me."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Quinnana here will be sharing our stall, and stocks a whole range of other tools should you need them!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"I can hardly believe this is actually happening... Me, working under the tutelage of the Warrior of Darkness <span class=\"emphasis\">and</span> Master Grenoldt!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The splendorous coffer will dispense a primary tool based on your current class at the time that it is opened."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Tools for other classes can be obtained by speaking to Quinnana at Grenoldt's workbench just outside the Crystalline Mean."}],"reward":{"items":[{"id":38809}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":90,"id":35}],"questsType":"all","quests":[70000,69139]},"next":[70267]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1045070","obj":{"i":1045070,"n":"Chora-Zoi","l":2951,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1045073","obj":{"i":1045073,"n":"Grenoldt","l":2951,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"38809","obj":{"i":38809,"n":"Splendorous Coffer","l":1,"c":26509,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"70000","obj":{"i":70000,"n":"Endwalker","g":11,"l":"Ultima Thule","s":618}},{"type":"quest","id":"69139","obj":{"i":69139,"n":"The Boutique Always Wins","g":0,"l":"Eulmore","s":0,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"70267","obj":{"i":70267,"n":"A Dedicated Tool","g":85,"l":"The Crystarium","s":20,"r":1,"f":1}}]}
