Travel with Ser Alberic to the Steel Vigil, that you might share the truth of Ferndale with the young dragoon before the battle is joined.","You and Ser Alberic locate Estinien, but the fugitive dragoon has already learned the truth of the past on his own. Enraged at what he perceives to be Ser Alberic's failure to defend his home, Estinien turns upon you. Your virtuous spirit and mastery of the lance, however, prove more than a match for your adversary, and the being of darkness vanishes from sight, taking the fallen dragoon with it. Return to the Observatorium to hear Ser Alberic's thoughts on the matter.","Shaken but no worse for the wear, Ser Alberic welcomes you back. Nidhogg's aura now subsided, his scalekin will return to slumber for the time being. Though concerned for Estinien's fate, Ser Alberic is heartened by your accomplishments, which give him newfound hope for the future. Until such time as the great wyrm wakes again, go forth as the Azure Dragoon and use your newfound strength in the name of justice.<br><br>※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"],"objectives":["Rendezvous with Estinien.","Speak with Alberic.","Defeat Estinien!"],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! An urgent message arrived from Estinien in your absence. He bids you come at once to the Steel Vigil. It would seem Nidhogg is on the move─and rather sooner than we had anticipated."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"It appears you have not yet fully become master of the dragon within you, and yet we are racing against time. I fear we have no choice but to do battle to the best of your current abilities, and without the drachen mail I promised."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Now let us away. Estinien must know the truth of Ferndale, lest he fall for the great wyrm's seduction."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Alberic. I have waited long for this day."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"You, who fancy yourself an Azure Dragoon. The man whose cause you have taken for your own is a coward. He relinquished the power of the dragon of his own volition and watched as Ferndale burned."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Do you not think it ironic that I was chosen Azure Dragoon? I, an orphan who has naught of value to protect in Ishgard?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"I suppose I must give thanks, for it was the Eye that revealed to me the truth─a truth so damning as to undo a lifetime of trust. I loved you as a father...but I can ill forgive you for Ferndale."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"As I understand it, you've kept even the archbishop in the dark regarding the missing Eye. Do you mean to take your shame to your grave?"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"But I waste my breath. Prepare yourself, old man, for I shall lay to waste all the things you hold dear. And once I'm finished with you, I shall do what no Azure Dragoon has succeeded in doing─I shall claim Nidhogg's head!"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Calm yourself, Estinien!"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Your rage renders you vulnerable to the dragon's influence!"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"In you, I thought I had found kindred, someone beside whom I could fight the great wyrm."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"It is with a heavy heart that I relinquish that dream. Your affection for this coward has rendered you deaf to your own destiny."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Very well. That we would one day cross lances was inevitable from the moment of our first meeting─as we shall now find out who is the Eye's true chosen. There can be only one!"},{"name":"DRAGON","text":"(-Voice from Within-)<span class=\"emphasis\">Feeble creature... Dost thou desire power</span>?"},{"name":"DRAGON","text":"(-Voice from Within-)<span class=\"emphasis\">Look to thine anger and to thy hatred... It is there that thou shalt find it...</span>"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"O mighty Nidhogg! Lord of Dragons!"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Grant unto me thy blood, that I might be granted the claws and fangs wherewith to rend thine enemies!"},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"...<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!? Th-This is impossible! It cannot be!"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Forgive me, Estinien... I have failed you once again..."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"I am fine, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Somewhat shaken, but otherwise whole of body. Suffice it to say I have much to reflect upon. Let us return to the Observatorium."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"When the being of darkness closed upon us, you appeared to me the spitting image of Haldrath the Dragonseye, just as he is depicted in the holy scriptures."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"I thought that mayhap the years had taken their toll on my mind, but behold─the Soul of the Dragoon shines as it never did in all the years I bore it."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"It would seem you have achieved that which was thought impossible: you have awakened to the ability that none but the first Azure Dragoon possessed."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Truly, a momentous achievement. I can still scarce believe that you were able to summon the selfsame drachen mail worn by Haldrath! To think that it had been sealed within the soul crystal all this time..."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"I have borne witness to many and more wonders over the years, yet none compares to you, my young dragoon. Could it be that you are...?"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Ahem. Mark not my mutterings. I am certain that it was your indomitable sense of justice that resonated with the spirit of the first Azure Dragoon, prompting him to bestow the armor upon you. Yes, that is doubtless what happened."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"As the being of darkness faded, so too did Nidhogg's aura subside. And now his kind have ceased their stirring. Whether this was compelled by your awakening, I cannot say. I suspect we will learn the truth of it eventually."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Estinien, my dear boy... Whatever becomes of him, he will ever be as a son to me."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"I pray that he is somewhere out there still...and that he has not wholly forgotten the great man he once was."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"When that darkness brushed against me, the selfsame torrent of emotions swept over me as those I experienced twenty summers past."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"But there was something else besides. There was a voice, and it lamented the rift that divides dragons and men."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"You will come to comprehend what I speak in due time. Till then, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I pray that you will ever use your newfound strength in the name of justice."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This concludes the dragoon quests for FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn.
