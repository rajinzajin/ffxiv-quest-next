Nevertheless, the vastness of space has not lost its intrigue. Indeed, the lunar surface is a land that yet captivates many of us, and some, such as myself, hope to one day journey there."},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"The end now looms large, its shadow growing longer and more inescapable with each passing day. We must use what little time we have today to think of tomorrow─and the eventuality of a new life on the lunar surface."},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"Aye, we may soon find ourselves pioneering that rugged, hithertofore unknown terrain. And to do that, we must prepare─and prepare well."},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"As I understand it, <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> have firsthand experience with that vast emptiness. Perhaps, then, you would be willing to lend us a hand?"},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"If you are able, I would ask that you slay a center anila and from its carcass retrieve for us its core. So, what say you? Can you help us?"},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"You will? That is most heartening news. On behalf of all those who will someday step bravely onto that barren, unforgiving land, I thank you."},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"To think that a person such as you has walked the untraveled grounds of the lunar surface... It is a marvel indeed. I hope that one day very soon we shall follow in your footsteps─literally!"},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"You've returned, and far sooner than I had anticipated. So, tell me. Have you the core for which I asked?"},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"Well done. With this, we shall be one step closer to the fruition of our plan. All thanks to you, of course. "},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"The Loporrits claim that not all of the lunar surface can support life as we understand it. Rather, only certain pockets can be considered hospitable, such as southern Mare Lamentorum."},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"If we are to explore beyond the reaches of said safe areas, we will need a method by which we can survive those inimical wastelands for more than a few paltry moments."},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"Fortunately, we are researching one such method as we speak. It involves the storage of air─which is sadly absent up there─compressed into a wearable device which can purify the air expelled by its owner. The core you brought us will be a central component in its development."},{"name":"TATASAKO","text":"It will take some time before our research comes to anything, but rest assured we <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> see it done. And once we have, you will have the honor of knowing you've assisted us in making history! But since that's hardly helpful to you now, here─a reward for your efforts."}],"reward":{"gil":735,"items":[{"num":2,"id":36056}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69985]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1037606","obj":{"i":1037606,"n":"Tatasako","l":3708,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"36056","obj":{"i":36056,"n":"Salted Thavnairian Cod","l":545,"c":24315,"t":46}},{"type":"quest","id":"69985","obj":{"i":69985,"n":"Her Children, One and All","g":11,"l":"Labyrinthos","s":603}}]}
