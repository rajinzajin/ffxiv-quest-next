Rather than reward you himself, the retainer bids you return to Limsa Lominsa and speak with his supervisor, Frydwyb, in East Hawkers' Alley.","Recognizing that you are unfamiliar with the latest services provided by retainers, Frydwyb explains that ventures are procurement expeditions which you may ask your retainers to undertake. She then gifts you several ventures, a unique scrip used to pay for these services. Duly informed, you may now speak with your retainers and assign them these tasks at your leisure."],"objectives":["Search Skull Valley for the missing retainer.","Speak with Frydwyb in Limsa Lominsa."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Several adventurers are having difficulty summoning their retainers.
