It is from a prospective recruit who, aside from expressing interest in the guild and stating they will be arriving in Eorzea shortly, has neglected to mention anything of actual significance. Without a name, gender, or age to determine who they might be, Forgemaster Brithael knows there is only one person up to the task of tracking them down and seeing that they are escorted back. Make your way to the Limsa Lominsa ferry docks and see if anybody there catches your eye.","You come across a girl draped in Far Eastern finery, who─along with an unctuous-looking man─appears to have been apprehended by a Yellowjacket. As you approach, she calls out to you, asking if you have come to escort her to the Blacksmiths' Guild. The officer, thinking you know her, informs you he has arrested the young woman for attempting to slash at the man beside her for his unwelcome advances. He then proceeds to release her to you under the agreement that you keep her sword from her. The Far Eastern girl, clearly insulted, pipes up to say that the weapon is no regular sword but rather a katana she forged herself. She asks that you present it to Forgemaster Brithael as testament to her skill as a smithy. Show the girl to the guild and present her katana to Brithael.","As Forgemaster Brithael is appraising the quality of the katana, the girl from the docks bursts in through the doors. Mentioning she lost you on your way back to the guild, she then launches into a self-introduction. She is Sekka from Kugane, an aspiring swordsmith who has come to Eorzea to study under Brithael. When the forgemaster moves to induct her into the guild in an official capacity, however, she quickly declines the offer, instead begging him to take her under his wings off the books. He tells her the only way he can agree to those terms is if she were to share her family's smithing techniques in exchange for what she would learn at the guild─an offer she is quick to accept before leaving as abruptly as she came.<br><br>※The next blacksmith quest will be available from Brithael upon reaching level 63."],"objectives":["Search for the prospective recruit at the Lominsan ferry docks.","Deliver the unadorned katana to Brithael."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Ain't today shapin' up to be a mighty fine day! First I get a promisin' letter from a potential recruit from the Far East and not long after ye show up."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Aye. I know. Couldn't believe it meself when I learned that someone from beyond the five seas wanted to take up an apprenticeship at our humble establishment, but sure as day, that's what it says on this here paper."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"(-Letter from the Far East-)Forgemaster Brithael,<br>I am writing to you today to express my desire to learn more about your guild and the blacksmithing techniques you employ. I am currently preparing to depart for Limsa Lominsa and should be arriving shortly after this reaches you."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Er─on second thought perhaps “promisin'” wasn't the right word. He don't expressly state he's lookin' to join or even give us a name, for that matter. &lt;sigh&gt; Well, at least they're an enthusiastic bugger, which is a lot more than can be said about half me crew at the moment."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"We've been a bit shorthanded, so everyone's been working from sunup to sundown. They're dead on their feet, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. That's why I'll be sendin' ye to escort our mysterious new recruit back here."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"I know, I know. The letter ain't much to go on. I reckon if you snoop about the docks fer long enough, though, ye'll come across our friend sooner or later."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Ah, right. I forgot to mention, if he looks suspicious ye best avoid him. We've already enough troubles as it is."},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"What in the seven hells is wrong with these two!?"},{"name":"NAMPAMAN00000","text":"Sh-She attacked me! The bloody woman attacked me! I-I didn't do anything, I swear!"},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">Sir</span></span>. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">Sir</span></span>, please! By the look of it, you are from the Blacksmiths' Guild. You've been sent to collect me, have you not?"},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"You know this girl? She's been stirring up a great deal of trouble, and I'm of half a mind to take her into custody for attempted assault."},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"Earlier, this man accosted her when she stepped off the boat. Rather than telling him to bugger off or approach a nearby officer for help, however, she responded by pulling out a sword and slashing wildly at him."},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"Luckily, I was close enough to intervene and prevent anyone from coming to harm. I've been questioning them since, but I haven't been able to get a peep out of the girl, and this fool beside her won't stop spouting lies."},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"You stopped me without just cause and refused to let me go even after I explained that I have somewhere I need to be. There was nothing left for me to say, least of all to a...a churl like you!"},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"Ch-Churl...!? Listen here, young lady. While that may be a suitable word to describe this ruffian, I am no such thing. I am a <span class=\"emphasis\">Yellowjacket</span>─keeper of peace and defender of Limsa Lominsa."},{"name":"NAMPAMAN00000","text":"First I'm nearly stabbed, and now you disservice me with your ugly words! All I did was shower a pretty girl with compliments. That hardly warrants this abuse!"},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"That's all you did, is it now? Perhaps next time you should use your mouth to do some of that <span class=\"emphasis\">complimenting</span> instead of your hands─if there is a next time, that is."},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"Truth be told, the only reason I was even here to save your sorry arse was because I came to issue you with a warning. We've received a flood of complaints regarding your unscrupulous behavior."},{"name":"NAMPAMAN00000","text":"I...er, well... Sh-She tried to <span class=\"emphasis\">kill</span> me!"},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"While I'll turn the girl and her sword over to you, I ask that you keep this thing well out of her reach. She may have had her reasons, but I will not tolerate a repeat of this incident. Are we clear?"},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"That is simply a blade I keep on hand for self-defense. It is a rubbish weapon, really. You can keep it. I will, however, have you know that that is no ordinary sword. Rather, it is a katana─the traditional weapon of the Far East."},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"No, wait. I have an even better idea. <span class=\"emphasis\">You</span> can present my katana to Forgemaster Brithael. While by no means one of my better creations, it should prove sufficient to demonstrate my skill to him."},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"Now then, let us not waste any more time. Please, lead the way to the Blacksmiths' Guild."},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"A katana wrought by her own hand? Seems she's a blacksmith of exceptional skill. She claims its rubbish, but that's a finer weapon than any I've ever wielded."},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"For all her talent, though, that girl's going to be a handful. Brithael's in charge over at the Blacksmiths' Guild, isn't he? My sincerest sympathies to him."},{"name":"YELLOWJACKET00000","text":"Better that sword─er, katana─in Forgemaster Brithael's ale-sodden hands than in hers. While you see that she is escorted to the Blacksmiths' Guild, I'll be taking this fool back with me."},{"name":"NAMPAMAN00000","text":"Since when is it a crime to talk to someone? Besides, it's not as though I approached her with any less-than-noble intentions. Honest!"},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Didn't manage to find 'em, did ye? Was a bit of a long shot to begin with, I suppose. ...Hm? Ye've something ye want to show me?"},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"A katana? It's certainly of fine make. I'd say it's right up there with some of the stuff me better smitties can pound out. Where'd it come from?"},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"(-Feminine Voice-)From my personal collection, of course."},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"Apologies, I lost sight of <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> on our way here. Please, allow me to introduce myself. I am Sekka, aspiring swordsmith from Kugane."},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"Forgemaster Brithael, it is an honor to finally meet you in person. As stated in my letter, I have come to Eorzea that I might be placed under your tutelage."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Not to be rude or anythin', but ye say yer lookin' to become a swordsmith. Why come all this way? Surely, there are places where yer from better suited to honin' yer talents."},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; A certain someone has banned me from taking up the hammer at any of the local forges. While I am certain he thought doing so would deal a crushing blow to my career, it has only served to strengthen my resolve."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"So...yer lookin' to join our guild, then?"},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"...Not quite. I would like to simply <span class=\"emphasis\">study</span> here. I believe learning the techniques you employ and applying them to my craft will allow me to expand my repertoire and evolve as a swordsmith."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Ah, lass. Ye can't simply waltz in here, take all our secrets, an' then waltz right back out without givin' us somethin' in return."},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"But, sir! You must understand I simply cannot become a permanent member of your guild. Please, <span class=\"emphasis\">please</span>, can you make an exception just this once?"},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"I did not travel the high seas to leave here empty-handed. Surely, there must be a way..."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Yer not makin' this easy... &lt;sigh&gt; I suppose we could make a trade of sorts, where ye share yer smithin' techniques with us in exchange fer yer studies here."},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"Yes! I'd be more than happy to agree to that!"},{"name":"SEKKA","text":"Now that that is settled, I shall be taking my leave to search for accommodation. Forgemaster Brithael, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, until we meet again."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Well, wasn't she somethin'..."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Startin' up trouble right off the boat, eh? &lt;sigh&gt; Why is it I'm struck by the sudden urge to take a trip to the Wench and drown meself in ale..."},{"name":"BRITHAEL","text":"Ah, but mayhap she won't be so bad. We simply got off on the wrong foot, is all...or at least so I hope.
