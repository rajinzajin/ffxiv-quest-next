A sudden visit from his father, however, serves to illustrate the difficulties the chief machinist faces in his attempts to subvert Ishgard's traditional way of thinking. After apologizing for subjecting you to his family squabble, Stephanivien then invites you to join him in eastern La Noscea, where he hopes to find a part for his latest invention. Speak with Rostnsthal in Raincatcher Gully, and continue your instruction in the machinist trade.","Though obviously unhappy about the trek out to the gully, Rostnsthal sees the material-gathering expedition as a fine opportunity to test the extent of your improvement. Speak with Stephanivien, and defend him from any threats that arise.","You succeed in slaying the hostile wildlife that swarm the crash site, but it seems that Stephanivien is no closer to locating the part he has come to find. Speak next with Joye, and protect her while she continues picking over the wreckage.","Joye is appreciative of your assistance with the aggressive wildlife, but her efforts have also failed to uncover the elusive magitek component. Return to Rostnsthal and hear his evaluation of your marksmanship abilities.","Almost immediately after Rostnsthal praises your improvement with firearms, you are forced to dispatch a rampaging goobbue. Oddly enough, the bullet-ridden corpse of your foe yields what appears to be a functioning piece of Garlean technology. Show the magitek part to Rostnsthal.","Rostnsthal looks over the offal-covered piece of machinery, but can make neither heads nor tails of it. Take his advice, and hand the component over to Stephanivien.","You hand over the magitek component, and the chief machinist lets out a jubilant shout─it would seem that the gyroscope you recovered was the very part for which he had been searching. Return in triumph to the Skysteel Manufactory, and speak once more with Stephanivien.","Still giddy with delight at your serendipitous discovery, Stephanivien informs you that the completion of his prototype is now but a matter of time. While the inventor works on his new creation, however, it seems Rostnsthal would have you master a new firearm skill...<br><br>※The next machinist quest will be available from Stephanivien upon reaching level 40."],"objectives":["Speak with Rostnsthal in Raincatcher Gully.","Speak with Stephanivien and defeat enemies that appear.","Speak with Joye and defeat enemies that appear.","Speak with Rostnsthal.","Report to Rostnsthal.","Hand the magitek gyroscope #41 to Stephanivien.","Speak with Stephanivien at the Skysteel Manufactory."],"dialogue":[{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Greetings, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Have you become practiced at defeating your foes from a distance? With the range of our weapons, even skyborne dragons will learn to respect the threat posed by a trained machinist!"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Despite the proven efficacy of our cannons and ballistas, however, many knights of Ishgard continue to eschew firearms in favor of the spear and the sword. Ah, the creaking chains of tradition. ...Hark! The very creaking I spoke of draws near!"},{"name":"BAURENDOUIN","text":"(-Noble Knight-)&lt;sniff&gt; Ugh, this stifling heat and sulphurous stench─I can scarcely breathe. And worse, I can scarcely bear the sight of mine own son garbed in such filthy garments. Why must you persist in this infatuation with <span class=\"emphasis\">smithing</span>, of all things?"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"'Tis called “machinistry,” Father. And you need not come at all if the air in the workshop so offends you."},{"name":"BAURENDOUIN","text":"Would that I could shed this onerous duty! But as manufactory chief, I must needs supervise its operations."},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Supervise? You barely visit but once a moon, and relegate every management task to Fromelaut."},{"name":"BAURENDOUIN","text":"And what of it? Smithing is a commoner's profession...even as overseer is the role of a noble."},{"name":"BAURENDOUIN","text":"As one of the four founders of Ishgard, House Haillenarte enjoys a privileged position. But misfortune has waged a constant war of attrition on our forces, and our claim to that position grows weak. Thus must we attend to our duties with uncommon zeal─even duties as common as this one."},{"name":"BAURENDOUIN","text":"But we shall not suffer this mean predicament forever. No, my son, you will reclaim the honor of our family with spear in hand! You must needs become a knight of skill nonpareil, and bear our flag onto the field of battle."},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Father, the face of war changes with each passing day. Soon will come a time when machinists shall form the bulk of our armies! Should you cling to these stagnant ideas of yours, you will be swept over by the wave that carries us forward!"},{"name":"BAURENDOUIN","text":"I tire of your flights of fancy, Stephanivien. Without successes to back them, your arguments ring as empty as my treasure room."},{"name":"BAURENDOUIN","text":"The Holy See has announced a tourney. You will best serve your house by returning to the practice field, and thence claiming victory in the melee!"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"I regret that you were subject to our squabbles, but Father's attitude is sadly representative of the greater part of Ishgard's populace─their heads may as well be made from the stone of the city walls."},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"I have, however, designed a weapon of such brilliance, that the light of its potential will penetrate even the densest mind. Rostnsthal and Joye will accompany me to Raincatcher Gully to gather materials for the prototype─why don't you join us!?"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Practicing your marksmanship in Ishgard will only invite suspicion and ridicule, and this is the perfect opportunity to receive further tutelage from Rostnsthal. That you might also train under the warm rays of La Noscea's sun is simply a fortuitous boon!"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Join us in Raincatcher Gully if you wish to continue your training with Rostnsthal!"},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"Got yerself dragged out 'ere as well, did ye? The boss said 'e needed some magitek part, an' I just 'ad to open me big gob about this Garlean wreck in the gully..."},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"It's been rustin' 'ere for nigh on five years now, though, so any useful bits an' bobs was likely stripped out long ago."},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"But seein' as we've trekked all this bloody way, we might as well see 'ow far ye've come in yer shootin'. Go say 'ello to the other two, an' keep 'em safe while they concentrate on their scroungin'."},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"There's all sorts o' nasties wanderin' about the place. Shoot whatever comes close to the boss an' Joye, an' I'll call that yer next evaluation."},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Ah, you came! Splendid! Though I am afraid the rewards have yet to meet the risks of this monster-infested crash site. ...And speaking of monsters!"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Nicely done, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Now, I must return to the search..."},{"name":"JOYE","text":"Practicin' yer marksmanship, are you? Maybe I'll have half a moment's peace to look for this part while you watch me back. ...Ugh, not again! Take care of that, would you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"JOYE","text":"Nice shootin', <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Now, if only we could find his lordship's part, I might get back to me own trainin'..."},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"Ye've been workin' at those shots, 'aven't ye, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">lad</span></span>? I'd say yer good an' ready to─ Bloody 'ells, that's a big one! Yer up, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"Aye, nice form, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">lad</span></span>. Tightly grouped shots. Now, was it just me eyes playin' tricks, or did summat other than guts drop outta that thing's belly?"},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"Hmmm... Looks like a bit o' machinery. The boss'd 'ave a better idea than me."},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"Go show that part ye found to Stephanivien. Might be as 'e can make some use of it."},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Confound it. All this way, and naught to show for it...aside from your obvious improvements in marksmanship, of course! Hm? What's that you have there?"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"...And this spilled out along with the creature's innards, you say? Extraordinary."},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"...By the Fury, do you know what this is!? You've found the very component I was searching for!"},{"name":"JOYE","text":"That's wonderful, me lordship!"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Our fortunes took a turn for the better the moment you walked through the workshop doors, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"Findin' a rare magitek part in a beast's belly ain't fortune─that's bloody sorcery..."},{"name":"ROSTNSTHAL","text":"Or, so I'd think if I didn't see ye shoot the damn thing with me own two eyes. Nice work there, by the way, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"I can already hear the whirring of my invention come to life! Come, we must return to the manufactory at once!"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"That truly was a stroke of luck, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. With that wretchedly rare gyroscope in hand, 'twill only be a matter of time until I have a working prototype!"},{"name":"STEPHANIVIEN","text":"Instead of twiddling your thumbs until its completion, however, you shall have your hands full mastering a new skill─Rostnsthal bade me pass on to you the particulars of Heat Blast.
