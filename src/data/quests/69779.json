I knew I'd find one of you eventually. Can you talk? I have so many things I wish to ask you!"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"We have learned much about you thanks to our collaborators on Etheirys, but it has become clear there is a great deal they neglected to mention. Your stunted growth, for example."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"Rather than speculate on other crucial details we may have overlooked, we're hoping you can clarify a few things, if that's all right?"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"Thank you so much! A few of my fellow Loporrits are sure to have burning questions of their own. If you could wait here a moment, I'll go and fetch them."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The following event cannot be skipped. You may wish to cancel any pending Duty Finder registrations."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"Sorry to keep you waiting."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"Now, then. Shall we get started?"},{"name":"LOPORRITSB04243","text":"First, we'd like to ask about typical methods of stress relief."},{"name":"LOPORRITSB04243","text":"We have read that, when thrust into a new and otherwise unfamiliar environment, the people of Etheirys can become quite stressed. Should the worst come to the worst and they're forced to relocate here to the moon, well..."},{"name":"LOPORRITSB04243","text":"We're considering a number of contingencies based on what we've read, but being a native of Etheirys yourself, we're quite curious to know how you prefer to relieve stress."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Exercise always helps me relax."},{"name":"A1","text":"I usually sleep my troubles away."},{"name":"A1","text":"Breaking the bones of my enemies is quite therapeutic."},{"name":"LOPORRITSB04243","text":"Exercise, you say? Fascinating! I don't believe we have facilities quite suited for exercise, but fear not─it's nothing a little renovation cannot fix."},{"name":"LOPORRITSB04243","text":"Interesting. Perhaps we should consider creating sleep-inducing carrots to help people relax."},{"name":"LOPORRITSB04243","text":"You what!? Oh dear, how barbaric! I suppose the exertion required to do so can help relieve stress... Perhaps we can repurpose our supporters for mock combat."},{"name":"LOPORRITSB04243","text":"That was certainly enlightening, thank you. We'll make a paradise out of the moon yet. Just wait and see!"},{"name":"LOPORRITSC04243","text":"I too have a rather pertinent question─what do your people do for recreation?"},{"name":"LOPORRITSC04243","text":"We have pored over every book provided to us from cover to cover, but the answer yet eludes us."},{"name":"LOPORRITSC04243","text":"As such, we're quite certain what few ideas we had for entertainment are wanting for inspiration. So tell us, what do you enjoy?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Eating always raises my spirits."},{"name":"A2","text":"Travel and exploration of the unknown can be quite exhilarating."},{"name":"A2","text":"The carnage of battle makes my heart sing."},{"name":"LOPORRITSC04243","text":"Now that I can relate to! We'll be sure to prepare plenty of carrots so you can eat to your heart's content."},{"name":"LOPORRITSC04243","text":"Oh, good. There are myriad places to visit on the moon aside from Mare Lamentorum. They all look more or less the same, though..."},{"name":"LOPORRITSC04243","text":"Urgh, so uncivilized! But fighting can be entertaining in its own way, I suppose. I wonder if any of our facilities could be adapted into an arena of sorts."},{"name":"LOPORRITSC04243","text":"I think I have a better idea of what needs to be done next. Thank you!"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"One last question, if I may. And perhaps the most important we could ask of you."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"Do you...like carrots?"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Carrots? Disgusting!"},{"name":"A3","text":"Not particularly."},{"name":"A3","text":"I <span class=\"emphasis\">love</span> carrots!"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"Really!? Well, no matter. Once you've tasted our carrots, you won't be able to stop eating them. And not simply because of the special herbs they're prepared with!"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"Well, I'm sure you'll change your mind once you try one of our carrots of happiness!"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"I'm glad to hear it! We need to eat too, though, so try to leave some for us."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"I think that covers everything. Thank you for your time!"},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"That was awfully nice of you taking time to answer our questions. It was more helpful than you know."},{"name":"LOPORRITSA04243","text":"Every word of what you said is here in my notes, and I plan to share it with everyone. Mark my words─we'll transform the moon into a marvel unlike anything you've ever seen!"}],"reward":{"gil":655},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69939]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1041792","obj":{"i":1041792,"n":"Inquisitive Loporrit","l":3711,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69939","obj":{"i":69939,"n":"Styled a Hero","g":11,"l":"Mare Lamentorum","s":557}}]}
