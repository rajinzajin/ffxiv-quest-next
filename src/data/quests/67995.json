Needless to say, Lyse is reluctant to let him go, and insists that you follow the poor man─not to interfere, but simply to see that he makes it safely to his destination.","You spy a feather in the dirt, which Meffrid confirms is from Wercrata's chocobo. By his reckoning, the villager headed west past a collapsed bridge. Fortunately, there are plenty of places from which you should be able to observe Wercrata discreetly...","From a distance, you observe Wercrata meeting with the Skulls─a unit of Ala Mhigan conscripts, judging by their accents. The encounter soon turns violent, with the soldiers beating the prostrate villager while simultaneously berating him for defying the imperials and giving them reason to mistrust all Ala Mhigans. Unable to bear the injustice, Lyse rises to intervene but is stopped by Meffrid, who tells her that saving the man would only invite reprisals against his family, if not his whole village. For a mercy, the Skulls' commander eventually orders them to stop, as they are needed elsewhere. Wercrata will live to see another day.","It sickens Meffrid to the soul to see his countrymen doing the bidding of the viceroy. But they have made their choice, and he is prepared to cut down every last one of them if it comes to it."],"objectives":["Search for Wercrata's trail near the Ziggurat.","Follow Meffrid.","Speak with Meffrid."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MEFFRID","text":"Aan like him are barely considered people under imperial rule.
