I was wondering if you would be willing to help hand out a few advent cakes? It is customary for us to do so during Heavensturn."},{"name":"TIGGERMISSIONARY","text":"We finished preparing them but a short while ago, and who better to share them with the townspeople than the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> of the hour!"},{"name":"TIGGERMISSIONARY","text":"Come to hand out more advent cakes? You are too kind."},{"name":"TIGGERMISSIONARY","text":"Here you are. Pray take these to Hawkers' Alley. I imagine it won't be long before you find passersby eager for one of these delectable delights."},{"name":"TIGGERMISSIONARY","text":"Take those cakes to Hawkers' Alley on the lower decks and pray hand them out to the passersby."},{"name":"MOCHIDAIKAN","text":"Can I interest you fine folks in some delicious rice cakes? There is no better way to celebrate Heavensturn than with a delicious treat!"},{"name":"MOCHIDAIKAN","text":"Hello there, old friend! What brings you here this fine <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">evening</span><span class=\"alternative\">morning</span><span class=\"alternative\">afternoon</span></span>? ...Wait, have you come to help distribute advent cakes? Your timing could not be better."},{"name":"MOCHIDAIKAN","text":"Why, hello there. Can I interest you in some advent cakes? What's that? You have been sent to help me, have you? Splendid!"},{"name":"MOCHIDAIKAN","text":"Back to spread more joy through advent cakes? Wonderful!"},{"name":"MOCHIDAIKAN","text":"All right. The key is to position yourself somewhere that sees plenty of footfall. I shall go ahead and hand my cakes out elsewhere."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Someone rather familiar approaches you."},{"name":"Q1","text":"Who is it?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Seems to be a local tavern owner."},{"name":"A1","text":"Seems to be a Yellowjacket."},{"name":"A1","text":"Seems to be a...white bunny?"},{"name":"BADERON","text":"I 'eard some over 'ere was passin' about advent cakes. Never dreamed it'd be you of all people! Well, can we 'ave some?"},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"Ah, that's it─that's the ruddy taste! I'd been wantin' to do somethin' with rice cakes at the Bismarck, but I still can't get 'em to taste like the real thing."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"Me an' old Lyngsath 'ere usually enjoy each other's company over drinks, but we nearly got into a brawl the other day talkin' about the best way to prepare rice cakes."},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"Never did come to an agreement, though, so we decided we'd both try a hand at it an' see whose was best."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"In case yer curious, I cooked me rice cakes first, drizzled some Far Eastern soy sauce on 'em, and then wrapped the blighters in seaweed."},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"Just listen to this tripe. They're best in a rich broth with a few choice ingredients. A piping-'ot soup with yer cakes is a sight better than that load o' bilge ye call food."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"Still itchin' fer a fight, eh!?"},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"Well, that's generally 'ow it went, anyway. Doubt we'll ever find common ground at this rate."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"Ha, ye can say that again. At least we'll never run out o' things to talk about at the tavern."},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"Sounds like yer givin' up to me!"},{"name":"BADERON","text":"Anyroad, we'll be seein' ye around, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Stick yer 'ead in the Drowning Wench next time ye've got some time on yer 'ands."},{"name":"SUNDHIMAL","text":"Would you happen to be the one handing out advent cakes?

Could I trouble you for one?"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; &lt;huff&gt; &lt;huff&gt;"},{"name":"SUNDHIMAL","text":"Ah, if it isn't Wawalago. What ever has you in such a hurry today?"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Well, I helped myself to a rice cake back at the guild and, er, apparently it was Sisipu's..."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"She came at me with the anger of a thousand coeurls. I fear naught but savory replacement will sate her anger."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Oi, Wawalago! Hurry up and hand over that cake!"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Bloody hells, that's her! Sorry, no time for talk!"},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Not so fast, thief!"},{"name":"SUNDHIMAL","text":"Oh dear. Would you mind if I took one more cake for Wawalago?"},{"name":"SUNDHIMAL","text":"In his panic, he seems to have forgotten to take a cake for her..."},{"name":"SUNDHIMAL","text":"Worry not. I shall see to it that all is well between them soon enough. I would not be much of a Yellowjacket if I were unable to solve a little scuffle such as this, after all!"},{"name":"SUNDHIMAL","text":"You have my thanks! Well, time for me to take my leave."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"It has been too long since last we met, old friend."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"You do not recognize me? I concede the phantom you slayed recently was a fair likeness, but surely our battle was far more memorable."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"Tell me, what is it you are handing out to the people here?"},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"A most delectable treat indeed. Ah, how I enjoyed feasting on them with Tenzen at my side."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"Though, it was not always pleasant. Even now I vividly recall the time Genbu found one such treat lodged in his throat, or when Seiryu thought to swallow one whole, burning his mouth, and all the while Suzaku clamored for Tenzen to come and help them."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"But enough reminiscing, you must be wondering why I have come all this way. Given the beast chosen as this year's herald, it piqued my interest to hear the onmyoji would be traveling here to perform their holy rites."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"What they summon are merely shades, but they are made in my image. As such, I felt compelled to ensure no harm came to the people of these lands."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"The tale itself is little more than fancy, of course, but I was surprised to learn you of all people were chosen to play Tenzen."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"If I may be honest, their failure to faithfully depict those past events vexes me at times, but that is neither here nor there..."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"It is a lasting reminder of our hard-won victory over Koryu, and the peace restored to the Far East. Viewed thus, I can see no reason to be unduly harsh in my criticism."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"It is comfort enough that we and the other Four Lords shall always remember the truth of Tenzen's life."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"Speaking of the others, I beg you keep my visit here between us. Should Suzaku and Seiryu learn that I had the singular good fortune of seeing you perform as Tenzen, well... I would rather not think on it."},{"name":"BYAKKO","text":"And with that, I shall bid you farewell. I pray you continue to carry on Tenzen's legacy, as I know only you can."},{"name":"TIGGERMISSIONARY","text":"Ah, you are returned, and I see you are without advent cakes."},{"name":"TIGGERMISSIONARY","text":"Another day's work complete, then. Thanks in no small part to you. I pray you take your ease and enjoy the remainder of the Heavensturn celebration."}],"reward":{"items":[{"num":10,"id":24238}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}],"quests":[69559]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1035552","obj":{"i":1035552,"n":"Tora Bugyo","l":28,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"24238","obj":{"i":24238,"n":"Magicked Prism (Advent Cakes)","l":1,"c":22631,"t":85,"p":19}},{"type":"quest","id":"69559","obj":{"i":69559,"n":"Tangle with a Tora","g":194,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":202}}]}
