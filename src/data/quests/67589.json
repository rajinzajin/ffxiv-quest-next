According to one spectator, it was a fight for the ages, as the accused wielded a massive sword and worked his dark arts against his foe. In the end, however, he was no match for his opponent, who ran him through to a chorus of cheers. Seeing no need to afford the man a proper burial, the Temple Knights mean to dispose of the corpse by leaving it in the Brume. Intrigued by the spectator's account, you consider seeking out the knights and seeing this “demon” for yourself.","Kneeling before the body, you spy a crystal, and reach out to claim it. All at once, your body trembles, and a strangely familiar voice echoes in your ears. You collapse, and when you open your eyes, you find the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> standing before you, hale and healthy. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span> calls <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">herself</span><span class=\"alternative\">himself</span></span> Fray, and it would seem that reports of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> death were greatly exaggerated. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span> is intrigued when you tell <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> of the voice you heard, but before you can continue, a cry from the streets below draws your attention. You turn to leave, but Fray bars your path and insists that you discuss the “changes” you are undergoing due to touching <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> crystal.","The freedom to follow your heart─to defend the weak and punish the guilty as you see fit. This is the way of the dark knight, and Fray offers to teach you.
