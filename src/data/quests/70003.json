Should you find the time, speak with Pukty again and assist those remaining...in the spirit of love!"],"objectives":["Speak with Pukty Piko."],"dialogue":[{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I knew you would come. You've a marvelously convenient talent for appearing when we're in need, don't you? Anywho, trouble's afoot! Word has spread of our previous endeavors, which under normal circumstances would be cause for celebration, but not so today."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"We've been inundated with letters from across the realm, entreating our aid with all manner of vexations. Our fellows have left me here alone to field these pleas, but I can't see to all this by myself! Please, won't you assist me in bringing succor to the hearts of the weary?"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"I've made a tidy little list of those who have written to us. No need to see to their troubles in any particular order, mind you. Just, try not to let a request slip through the cracks, yes?"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Back again, I see! The heavy-hearted of the realm will rest easy knowing that you're on the case! Now then, which of these distraught Eorzeans will you assist this time?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"Whose dilemma will you see to?"},{"name":"A1","text":"The emissary of penned passions."},{"name":"A1","text":"The nameless adventurer."},{"name":"A1","text":"The winsome Padjal."},{"name":"A1","text":"The one who dreams of the wider world."},{"name":"A1","text":"The one redolent of boughs."},{"name":"A1","text":"On second thought, perhaps not..."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"You would see to what plagues my heart? You are far too goodly, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I confess that Aloyse's joyful union touched me in a way most unexpected─it sparked within me jealousy, of all things! For in her happiness, I saw reflected my own desires."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Yes, 'tis true! I am here to speak of my own beloved. The man with whom I wish to spend all my days and nights! The very gentleman to whom I am betrothed: one Ser Hortefense!"},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"The festivities have run us both off our feet, leaving us not a spare moment to while away together as we once did. It vexes me terribly, yet I cannot speak of it to him. I would flush like a schoolgirl and tie my tongue into knots! Instead, I mean to pour my woes onto parchment."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Oh, this explains a great deal! At first I couldn't understand what was upsetting you so, but now it's all clear as crystal to me. Right then, on to this letter! First, what style should she write it in?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Fill it with prolix paragraphs and poems, as is her wont."},{"name":"A2","text":"Keep it simple and straightforward."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"And how should she word her vexations?"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Forthrightly!"},{"name":"A3","text":"Be coy about them."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"There! 'Tis done. For better or worse, the missive is penned."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"And all that remains is its delivery, which I will attend to right away!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Goodness me... No sooner had Ser Hortefense read your letter than he made a beeline for the nearest door to race to your side, Lisette! It was all I could do to keep him from stampeding through the streets. A small miracle he had the presence of mind to even hold a pen."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"...It says he has been fretting over the same things as I have! In which case, why not come to me sooner? Honestly! He also writes that we shall sit down for a proper meal once Valentione's Day has come and gone, so I suppose there's no sense in holding it over his head... Although I ought to!"},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Ahem. Well! That settles my affairs, I should say. My deepest, most sincere gratitude for your help, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. You've conducted yourself with the diligence and sagacity befitting an emissary of affection. Now go forth and bestow your romantic wisdom upon those in need!"},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"“Why do you dance around the issue at hand? Be plain with me or I will never understand”... Heavens, perhaps it would have been wiser to be more forthcoming about my issues."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Well, irrespective of this noncommittal answer I've received, I am grateful to you for advising me in this matter."},{"name":"ADVENTURER04467","text":"We of the Adventurers' Guild seek to post a letter to our guildmaster, Mother Miounne."},{"name":"ADVENTURER04467","text":"Though we're yet an untrained and unblooded passel of adventurers, it still grieves us tremendously to admit that we sought her aid in a task we bungled not several nights gone."},{"name":"ADVENTURER04467","text":"We fear this blunder of ours will lower us in her estimation so abominably that we may never work again. We are determined to set this all to rights, but the question is how? What words will move Mother Miounne so that she will not see us as the lumbering dolts who stepped in it?"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Oh, that is a pickle! Count yourself lucky, though, for you're in the presence of a renowned adventurer, one who most assuredly understands well the problem you face. So, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? What advice can you impart to our flustered friends?"},{"name":"Q4","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A4","text":"Show contrition and gratitude in equal measure."},{"name":"A4","text":"Tell her that, barring this gaffe, you're sensational adventurers."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"And what would convince this Mother Miounne to provide them with more work?"},{"name":"Q5","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A5","text":"That failure is a novice's best learning tool."},{"name":"A5","text":"That you would do anything to make up for your previous mishap."},{"name":"ADVENTURER04467","text":"Here, 'tis writ at last."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Then I shall see to its safe and expedient delivery!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Pardon my tardiness. Miounne was kind enough to set out tea for me, and I could hardly refuse such an offer. It warmed my heart, to see such munificence! And, now that I reflect on it, such hospitality too is one form of love, isn't it. But I digress, what does Miounne write?"},{"name":"ADVENTURER04467","text":"What a relief it is to read this! She has seen how steadfast our convictions to the guild are. By hook or by crook, we shall not disappoint her! I, for one, am afire with determination! "},{"name":"ADVENTURER04467","text":"Your advice has rung true indeed. Thank you for your wisdom. We shan't forget it!"},{"name":"ADVENTURER04467","text":"Though she commends us on our ambition and zeal, she worries that we put our lives at risk by attempting tasks which exceed our abilities. I cannot deny the truth of what she says. Well, I'm decided─“circumspection” shall be our watchword going forward! "},{"name":"ADVENTURER04467","text":"You were wise to advise us as you did. I thank you for your help."},{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"Fancy seeing you here! And fancier still that you are the one to assist me. My conundrum is that, as ever, my brother and I are concerned for Kan–E's well-being. We thought to write her, but I know not what to say, and A–Ruhn has lifted not a digit to help."},{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"I would ask her to be mindful of her health, but does that not sound rather...fussy? Even more so when couched in “dearest sisters” and formal prose! Though I suppose Kan–E is both formal and fussy herself..."},{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"What is more, I haven't much practice in the ways of penning properly worded missives. My sister is, as I mentioned, a touch on the fussy side, and holds manners and decorum in high regard. Little doubt that she will read my words with a rather critical eye."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"You speak of Kan–E–Senna, the Elder Seedseer? She is revered among our kind! To think I will soon be delivering a letter to her...what an honor! But enough about me─we're here for Raya–O–Senna! <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, how do you think she should go about this?"},{"name":"Q6","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A6","text":"No need to stand on ceremony─be frank about your concern!"},{"name":"A6","text":"Show that you're serious by observing proper letter-writing etiquette."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Very well, but who should we say this letter is from? Raya–O–Senna may be the one composing it, but it was both her and her brother who meant to ask after her well-being. Hmmm... What are your thoughts?"},{"name":"Q7","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A7","text":"It should be from the person who wrote it."},{"name":"A7","text":"It should be from both her and her brother."},{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"There, I have finished. Might I entrust its delivery to you?"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Why of course! And away I go, kupo!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"The Elder Seedseer is a wonderful woman, as many have said. She saw how nervous I was and put me at my ease immediately! Your sister is lovely indeed."},{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"I am glad to hear it. Let us see how she replies. Hm... She applauds me for the maturity I show in writing her, and says that as an older sister, she could not be more proud. What a curious response! I ask her to watch her health, and she commends me on my maturity?"},{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"Strange as this answer is, it seems our words of worry have gotten through to her, thankfully. Though I was initially reluctant, I am glad we wrote her. My heart is lighter knowing she is well. Your assistance in these family matters is much appreciated."},{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"And I am glad to hear it. Now let's see how she replies. Oh, this is <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> what I expected to receive. Though she acknowledges our concern for her health, she prattles on about this, that, and the other thing, lecturing me all the while about “proper postal decorum”..."},{"name":"RAYAOSENNA","text":"Oh well. 'Twas a worthy attempt. While I had hoped for a different response, I am grateful for your help all the same. If you will excuse me."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">evening</span><span class=\"alternative\">day</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! It's lovely to see you again after all this time. I want you to know that I've been keeping to your advice, and am training day in and day out. I'm hopeful that soon I'll be able to take to the open road! "},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Greetings, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">ma'am</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. My name's Elyne, and it is an honor to meet one such as yourself. For you see, I've dreams of becoming an adventurer too. Oh, to think of all that you have seen, all the lands you have walked... How incredible!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"But as for why I'm here today, well...I want to write a letter to Kupka Kupp, to thank him for his support. Whenever I feel low, like I want to give up on my dream of seeing the world, Kupka is there for me to lift my spirits."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"A message for Kupka Kupp, hm? So, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? How do you think she should start it?"},{"name":"Q8","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A8","text":"Thank him for all his encouragement."},{"name":"A8","text":"Urge him to take time for himself during this busy season."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"And how should she finish the letter?"},{"name":"Q9","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A9","text":"Remind him not to overwork himself."},{"name":"A9","text":"Support him in his endeavors as he supports you in yours."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"I've taken your words to heart. I only hope this letter is enough to show Kupka how much he means to me."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"I'll make sure it reaches the right hands! Or paws, rather."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"If only you could have seen the look on Kupka's face when I told him who had written him. He couldn't stop twirling through the air! It was adorable, but don't tell him I said that. He was so touched, he managed to find time between his many deliveries to craft a reply, which I have here."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"He really was happy to receive my letter, wasn't he! He tells me he can feel my gratitude and love for him in every word I wrote. As wonderful as it is to talk with him in person, correspondence like this can be rather fun, too. "},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"I'm more motivated than ever to continue my training now. Thank you so much for the advice on my letter, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. And thank you, Pukty Piko, for delivering it to Kupka!"},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Oh, he writes me to apologize, saying that he never meant to cause me worry. An apology is the last thing I wanted from him. I think he might have misunderstood the intentions of my letter."},{"name":"ELYNE","text":"Well, we'll speak soon enough and I'll straighten all this out. Thank you for taking the time to help me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Farewell!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Hm? I didn't even notice this letter until just now, kupo! It must have slipped into my stack right under my nose─which is something of an astonishment, actually, as its wonderful scent is hard to miss! Let's see, who is it for... Oh! Why, it's addressed to you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-Faerie King's Letter-)I know very well the fun you're having right now─without me! Considering your tendency to be cold and cruel and <span class=\"emphasis\">heartless</span>, it wouldn't surprise me in the least if I were to learn you've forgotten all about me."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-Faerie King's Letter-)Why, oh why must <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> be the one writing <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>!? Your beautiful branch is deserving of much more attention than you deem fit to provide! How mean and terrible and <span class=\"emphasis\">rude</span> you are, sapling!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Oh my, aren't they a─ Ahem, sprightly one. I don't know who sent this to you, suffice it to say that whoever it is will be <span class=\"emphasis\">very</span> displeased if they don't receive a response. Perhaps it's best to pen one now, while you're here. So, who shall we make your letter out to?"},{"name":"Q10","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A10","text":"Dearest Titania, fair ruler of the fae!"},{"name":"A10","text":"To my beautiful branch, Feo Ul!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"And how will you express your adoration for them?"},{"name":"Q11","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A11","text":"Attach flowers and chocolate to your letter."},{"name":"A11","text":"Remind them that they are always in your heart."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Having groveled sufficiently onto the parchment, you seal your letter to the faerie king."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Now then, wait here while I... Oh my! The letter, it seems to be delivering itself, kupo! Stop. Stop, I say! Don't make me come after you! Oh bother... Wait for me, you silly thing. Wait for meee!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Despite my best efforts to keep up, I lost the blasted thing somewhere out in the Twelveswood! Then, as if this story needed to be any more peculiar, I discovered a similarly scented missive on the road back─and wouldn't you know, it's addressed to you!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-Faerie King's Letter-)I just knew my sweet little sapling could suss out who I was from the clues I planted in my letter! Your affection for me was writ so plainly in your last correspondence, I shall return it here, in kind. How could I do less!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-Faerie King's Letter-)My precious sapling, wherever your travels may take you, wherever the roads you walk lead, know that my heart goes with you. Every step of every path, be they through dungeons dank and dark or to mountain peaks magnificent, I am there, watching over you, always and forever."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-Faerie King's Letter-)Sweetest sapling, I am positively delighted to receive a message from you. Of that much, I can assure you."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-Faerie King's Letter-)And only that much. For as far as the contents of your letter are concerned, I am less than pleased. No, I am putting it too lightly. I am so far from pleased that I find myself incensed. Wrathful. Furious! You, sapling, should show your lovely branch the affection I so rightly deserve..."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Your assistance has proven positively indispensable, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! If you've the time and inclination, do come by again.
