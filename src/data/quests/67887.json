Though she neglects to explain the nature of her business there, she assures you it will not take long...","After being ambushed by the Diamond Forge artisans and their measuring tapes, you are called to attend a meeting with your fellow Scions at the Rising Stones. There, you discuss the future of the organization, only to be interrupted by the arrival of M'naago, a member of the Ala Mhigan Resistance. Between pained gasps, the wounded woman reports that one of the Resistance leaders─a masked man known as the Griffin─has embarked upon a course which will inevitably drag the Eorzean Alliance into conflict with the Empire. Hearing this, Y'shtola bids you bear word of the looming threat to Ishgard while she and the others notify the rest of the Alliance leaders. You resolve to bring the matter before Lucia at the Temple Knights' headquarters.","Lucia dutifully communicates the Scions' concerns to Ser Aymeric, and the lord commander soon agrees to send an envoy to the Alliance council. The nature of Ishgard's politics, however, requires that he first consult with his counterpart in the House of Commons to decide who will serve as the nation's representative. For the moment, there is little you can do but wait for the decision to be made..."],"objectives":["Wait for Tataru at the Diamond Forge.","Speak with Lucia at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly."],"dialogue":[{"name":"TATARU","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, just the hero I wanted to see!
