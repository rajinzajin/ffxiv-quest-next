Prepare for the fight of your life, and report to Cid at the Ceruleum Processing Plant.","You are ready to depart for the Praetorium, the stage upon which the fate of the realm shall soon be decided. Fight your way into the depths of the structure, in search of the Ultima Weapon, and when you find the Allagan relic...send a piece of it to each of the seven hells.<br><br>※Challenge the Praetorium with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the dungeon's entrance point.","Having swept aside all enemies in your path, you finally come face-to-face with Gaius van Baelsar himself. The confrontation concludes with the man's retreat, and you chase him to the Ultima Weapon's chamber.","Taking control of the fearsome weapon, the Black Wolf sets upon you once more. Do what you have come to do, and see that the magitek monstrosity never threatens Eorzea again.<br><br>※Challenge the Porta Decumana with other players via the Duty Finder, or with a party of NPCs via Duty Support. Both systems are accessible from the main menu as well as the trial's entrance point.","Shielded by Light, you weather the Ultima Weapon's relentless onslaught and succeed in laying it low. But your struggles are not yet over, for Lahabrea now intends to eliminate you himself, that none may prevent his god's rebirth.","As the Praetorium collapses around you, the Ascian descends to extinguish your flame. Strike down the servant of Darkness, and free your comrade Thancred from his enthrallment.","With Gaius van Baelsar slain, and the Ultima Weapon destroyed, it would seem that Eorzea may finally look forward to an era of peace. Yet even as the people of the three city–states gather to celebrate their deliverance, a deafening roar reverberates throughout every corner of the realm...<br>A dread primal has awakened.","What fearsome primal is this that has been roused? Perhaps Minfilia will be able to shed some light on the mystery.","In troubled tones, Minfilia reveals to you that shortly after the roar was heard around the land, an aetheric disturbance was observed, bearing a disquieting similarity to a phenomenon recorded five years ago. It would seem that your struggles are far from over. Steel your resolve anew, and set forth to shine the Crystal's light upon the realm."],"objectives":["Speak with Cid at the Ceruleum Processing Plant.","Enter the Praetorium.","Confront the Ultima Weapon at the Porta Decumana.","Confront Lahabrea on the Porta Decumana.","Speak with Minfilia."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To accept this quest, you must abandon the current main scenario quest.

Victory belongs to the bold, not the reckless. Bards are wont to sing of heroes who valued their life at naught next to honor, love, and liberty, but I tell you now: that which men value at naught, they sell cheap. Risk no more than you must, you hear me?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Now, best you were off─we have work to do, the both of us. See that your preparations are in order, then report to Cid.
