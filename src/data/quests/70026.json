Ogul all but drags you along with her as she heads off to the western shore to find your next Arkasodara employer.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","You meet with the Arkasodara fisherman, who explains that the overland routes have become unsafe due to the rising number of monsters in the area. He asks that you first speak with the nearby locals to gain a fuller understanding of the situation at hand, but it seems Ogul will be unable to accomplish that task without you at her side...","You indicate your readiness to help Ogul with her inquiries, and her face takes on a look of grim determination.<br><br>※You must be accompanied by Ogul to complete this task. Speak with her again should you become separated.","You question the locals, and learn that aggressive, long-tongued brutes have been terrorizing the roads. Return to the Arkasodara fisherman with your newfound insight.","The fisherman puts a name to the hostile creatures, calling them “pisaca.” It seems they are usually found further inland, but the lack of recent patrols has emboldened them to expand their territory─an invasion which must be met with decisive retribution. An eager Ogul rushes off to begin the hunt, leaving you to follow in her wake.","You find Ogul standing over the corpse of the pisaca she has slain. She asks that you pursue its fleeing packmates to the northwest while she hauls the carcass of her foe back to the fisherman.","You have slain the two remaining pisaca. Return to your employer and inform him of the deed.","Upon your return, the fisherman shares his philosophy on the sanctity of life, and explains how they intend to make use of the pisaca's remains. Ogul, for her part, is surprised and pleased by the similarities with her own tribe's customs. Little by little, it seems that she is learning to separate her feelings for the Arkasodara from her fear of their violent Gajasura cousins."],"objectives":["Speak with the Arkasodara fisherman.","Speak with Ogul and have her accompany you.","Speak with the local fishers while accompanied by Ogul.","Speak with the Arkasodara fisherman.","Search for Ogul.","Survey the area and slay any monsters you encounter.","Report to the Arkasodara fisherman."],"dialogue":[{"name":"OGUL","text":"I had no such troubles in Doma or Kugane, I assure you.

Because I could certainly benefit from your wise and experienced company!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"A fine pair of hunters we shall make! Come, let us speak with this...Arkasodara fisherman."},{"name":"KANCANA","text":"I hope your friend can overcome her fear of us─how unpleasant it must be to endure this constant state of terror."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I m-must overcome this..."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Come to take care of the monsters, have you? About damn time."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"We're fine when we're out on the water, of course. But even a fisher needs to walk on land every now and again, and the trails grow more perilous by the day."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"I've managed to sneak through without a scratch so far, but friends of mine haven't been so fortunate. Talk to the others around here, they'll tell you."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I might need your help with that, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Speaking with Arkasodara is still...challenging...for me."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Listen to a few stories first, and get an idea of what you're up against."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Should we do this together, then? Y-Yes! Fine! Good idea!"},{"name":"FISHERMANB04490","text":"Not now, friend, I need my rest..."},{"name":"FISHERMANB04490","text":"You want to hear about monsters?

When I left Akyaali the other day, I almost walked straight into a fiend with a tongue as long as my arm. Barely escaped being gobbled up on the spot."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I believe we have heard enough. Let us show our employer that we now grasp the situation."},{"name":"FISHERMANB04490","text":"Back to it, I suppose."},{"name":"FISHERMANC04490","text":"There must be a way to catch more fish in a day!"},{"name":"FISHERMAND04490","text":"Maybe I can curl up in the prow..."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Are you sure your friend is paying attention? I don't want to have to explain myself twice."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"So. Do you understand now why we had to send for help?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I understand that you have a problem with long-tongued brutes terrorizing your roads!"},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Those creatures are what we call “pisaca.” Without the army sending out regular patrols, it seems the inland monsters have begun expanding their territories."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"They've forgotten their fear of us, and that's when people start dying. I need you to remind them."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Once you've found and slain these overly bold pisaca, I ask that you bring me one of their carcasses─there's something I've been curious about."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Very well. Let us make of this a contest, shall we? The first to topple a “pisaca” is the victor!"},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Never seen anyone so eager to throw herself headlong into a pisaca's jaws... Shouldn't you be chasing after her?"},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Not too concerned about winning that contest of yours, then? Can't say as I blame you..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Hah! First kill is mine! Grandmother always said that the hunter should be swift, like a diving yol!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Would you mind tracking down the other two? Once they saw what I did to their friend, they fled to the northwest. I can haul this lump back to the beach while you finish the hunt."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You would be alone with an Arkasodara..."},{"name":"A1","text":"If you're so keen on fainting..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Pah!

Your friend is stronger than she looks─we had to load the carcass onto a boat to carry it away."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"What of the pisaca's packmates? Did you find them?"},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Both slain, then! That is good."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Of course <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> slew them! Songs of <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s deeds are sung across the Steppe!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"My aching arms would like to know why you wanted the remains, though..."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Why else? To make use of its parts. The scales can be spun into silver, and the meat will fill our pots; the bones and teeth, we can craft into hooks and other tools."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"We kill nothing for the sake of killing─even murderous monsters. The two bodies you left behind will serve as a warning to others of their kind. If it keeps them away, then no more blood need be shed."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Hmmm. It seems our tribes share similar customs when it comes to using every part of the kill. As Grandmother always said, “Be not wasteful of the lives you take to sustain your own.” ...You are so very different from your kin, the Gajasura."},{"name":"FISHERMANA04490","text":"Oho, so that's why you've been avoiding my gaze. If your only experience with Matanga has been our brutal cousins, then you'll find the Arkasodara an agreeable lot by comparison.

And well earned, I'd say."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Another job finished─we should report to Kancana, that she might strike it from her list.
