For many years, the man has happily served as the head chef of Rougecarpe Manor, but his master's recent passing has ushered in a wave of tyranny at the hands of the lord's second son. The new lord regent has demanded to be served a platter of highest-quality letter puffer at his next banquet, a fish thought to be long extinct. Should the chef fail to provide the fish, his life will be forfeit. Ansaulme bids you return to Limsa Lominsa and speak with Sisipu, fount of all fishy knowledge, to see if she has any information as to where the fish might be found.","Sisipu's studies lead her to believe that if any letter puffers are extant today, they would be found to the west of Ishgard, in the clouds of Dravania. She suggests you travel to the Churning Mists, and seek further guidance from the local residents.","You meet with Mogtoe, who suggests that you speak with Mogukk, the most avid angler in Moghome. He has recently been seen flying north on yet another fishing expedition. Search for Mogukk north of Moghome, and ask if he knows aught of the letter puffers' whereabouts.","Mogukk informs you that letter puffers are indeed indigenous to the Churning Mists. A few moons prior, he had the misfortune of catching one of the elusive creatures in the clouds around the Landlord Colony. If you should manage to reel in a specimen, he would be interested to see it for himself.","You show the letter puffer to Mogukk, who is delighted to see such a splendid specimen. As a reward for your efforts, he tells you a tale of a magical floating island, where strange fish swim in pools of aetherochemical effluent, sustaining themselves on a diet of fiend worms. If the tale is true, perhaps these worms could be used to hook the creatures from their peculiar pools? But now is not the time to be thinking of aetherfishing─deliver the letter puffer to Ansaulme before his friend meets an untimely end.","Ansaulme gratefully accepts the letter puffer and hands it to his old friend, warning him of its poisonous entrails. However, to the chef's shock, Ansaulme goes on to suggest that he use the fish's venom sac to poison the lord regent. In the ensuing exchange, Ansaulme confesses that the tyrannical regent is in fact his younger brother, making him the rightful heir to House Rougecarpe. He pledges to bring an end to his brother's reign of terror by finally accepting his inheritance. After satisfying his old friend that his travails are nearly over, Ansaulme turns the conversation back to his favorite subject─fish. You tell him how you caught the letter puffer, and the story Mogukk told you in return. To your great surprise, Ansaulme produces a sample of the fiend worms Mogukk spoke of, lending credence to the moogle's outlandish tale. If you should ever find your way to the floating continent, the vilekin would surely make the perfect bait for a spot of aetherfishing.<br><br>※The next fisher quest will be available from Ansaulme upon reaching level 60."],"objectives":["Speak with Sisipu in the Fishermen's Guild.","Ask the residents of Moghome for information.","Speak with Mogukk.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Catch a letter puffer in the Churning Mists.</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the letter puffer to Mogukk.</span></span>","Deliver the letter puffer to Ansaulme in Ishgard."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In order to undertake this quest, you must first complete the main scenario quest “Mountaintop Diplomacy.”"},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

By all laws and customs, control of the estate should have passed into the hands of the elder of his two sons, but the fellow is away on his travels right now, and has little interest in returning to the estate."},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"Of course, until he officially renounces his title, or turns up dead, someone has to take charge of the house's affairs. Hence his younger brother, the late lord's second son, has assumed control as lord regent."},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"But the boy is a dunderheaded fool!

When you went to Coerthas and caught those cloud cutters, it made me realize the guild was lacking in its learning about cloudkin─so I bought up every book I could find and read them all from cover to cover!"},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Letter puffers are a type of flying fish that are packed to the gills with a potent poison─slice out the venom sac and their meat makes for a tingling taste sensation, but a prick in the wrong place and you won't be leaving the latrine for a week."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"As for their migration habits, I'm sure I read something... Ah, yes─westerlies! Whenever the weather vane swung to the west, the Ishgardian nobles would go out in force to catch as many as they could."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"And they caught a fair few, alright. By all accounts they fished the poor puffers to extinction─in Ishgard, anyway. It could be they still colonize the clouds further west, over in Dravanian territory.

He got his rod out and started fishing again, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGTOE","text":"He was here in Moghome not so long ago, but he flew off to the north. He's not the fastest flyer, so if you leave now, you should be able to catch up with him.

Why, I caught one myself just a few moons back. It looked so delicious, I ate it up right there and then. ...Never again, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGUKK","text":"Those fish aren't just toxic, they're tricky, too─I've only ever managed to catch the one, and even that was an accident. A terrible, bowel-twisting accident... If you do manage to catch a letter puffer that's fit for a banquet, I'd like to take a look at it!"},{"name":"MOGUKK","text":"Those letter puffers live around here, but they don't often show their faces to fishers, kupo.

You're a fantastic fisher<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I never thought I'd see one of these letter puffers again─and it's such a big one, too! A fish like that would make a banquet fit for a king, let alone a lord regent, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGUKK","text":"Just make sure the chef removes the insides first─you don't want to end up with letter puffer poisoning, trust me! I never thought my fur would ever be this white again..."},{"name":"MOGUKK","text":"Still, I'm glad I got to see one again, kupo. And since you're such an accomplished angler, I'll let you in on a little secret─there are fish living in stranger places than this!"},{"name":"MOGUKK","text":"Long, long ago, kupo, there was an empire who had such mastery of magic that they made a whole continent rise up into the skies. The people who put it there might be long gone, but the island's still up there! And it's full of fish!"},{"name":"MOGUKK","text":"Some of the magic has spilled out onto the surface and formed into strange aetherochemical pools. Rumor has it that the fish in the spills feed on fiend worms, but I don't know if that's true─maybe the moogle who told me was just pulling my pom-pom, kupo!"},{"name":"MOGUKK","text":"If you ever find your way up there, you should try your hand at aetherfishing, kupo! Who knows what fantastical fish might be waiting for you in those pools?"},{"name":"MOGUKK","text":"Kupopopo! Thanks for letting me have a look at that letter puffer, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─now get it away from me before I start having flashbacks, kupo! ...It came over me in waves!

I'll protect you."},{"name":"FIEFMAN02088","text":"Thank you, m'lord...I do believe you will. But it's not only I who needs your protection─your people are suffering, m'lord! You must come back and claim your rightful inheritance!"},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"Hey, I thought I told you to keep quiet about that!"},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"...Well, it looks like the coeurl's out of the bag, so to speak. I don't suppose there's any reason to hide it from you any longer, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. That so-called lord regent who's terrorizing the smallfolk─he's my younger brother."},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"Ever since he was a boy, he dreamed of one day taking control of House Rougecarpe. He knew that I stood to inherit, and he hated me for it. That's why I went away─so that my brother's dreams could be realized, and I could devote my days to fishing, free from the burden of lordship."},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"But thanks to my brother's folly, that dream is over. My friend─I have made my decision. No longer will you have to suffer at the hands of that tyrannical fool! This time, it is he that shall suffer!"},{"name":"FIEFMAN02088","text":"Thank you, m'lord! The smallfolk'll be glad to hear of it, I'm sure. I'll start spreading the word that you're coming back to us─it'll give them the strength to put up with your brother's demands a little while longer."},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"Well, I think we've heard quite enough of my family problems. Now, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─tell me all about how you caught that letter puffer!"},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"...Magical pools on floating islands!? If even half of what that moogle told you is true, you're sure to find some pretty bizarre specimens there! I wager you're dying to try your hand at this “aetherfishing” lark!"},{"name":"ANSAULME","text":"And it just so happens that I've got a few of those fiend worms he spoke of right here. ...Don't look so surprised!
