The gaoler Ferdillaix sleeps at his post, and you must borrow his key.","The heavy key is safely in your hands, and Ser Ferdillaix remains asleep, dreaming of a happier night at the table. The bars are generously spaced, fortunately, and the key may be passed to Laurence without any difficulty.","Laurence is overjoyed to learn that his brother loves him still, and has taken the monumental risk of breaking a heretic out of the gaol. Ser Daimbert needs to be told that once the light grows kinder, Laurence will make his attempt.","You are taken aback by Ser Daimbert's thoroughness in planning this escape. None shall know of your part in this, of which you are grateful. You have no doubt scores will vouch for his and your innocence in this matter..."],"objectives":["Obtain the dungeon key.","Give the key to Laurence.","Report to Daimbert."],"dialogue":[{"name":"DAIMBERT","text":"Adventurer, a word.

They speak falsehood with their reasoning, and I no longer have faith that they are one with Halone."},{"name":"DAIMBERT","text":"Laurence is doubly innocent, for he never deserted. He left his post, yes, but to treat with an Ul'dahn trader for medicine that saved his betrothed's life.

I thought he had forsworn me, for he came not once to see me. I cursed him in my mind, but his cruelness was kindness, after all... I know of the hiding place he speaks.

I am telling you of how a jackal ate the cook's cat. Success? Good. When? Hour of the wolf. I'll loose my works then."},{"name":"DAIMBERT","text":"He must never return.
