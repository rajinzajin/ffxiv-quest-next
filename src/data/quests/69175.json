Best to take them down first!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Be not so hasty, Korutt. The animosity between your two clans notwithstanding, I would not resort to violence unless necessary."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"I will use an enchantment to render you invisible. It will not fool sin eaters, but it will suffice to hide you from the eyes of men."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"While you are thus concealed, do you think you could find us the earthseed?"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Aye, I'll dig up the choicest stuff there is!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"We would be much obliged.

It seems our alchemists got a little carried away with the latest batch..."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"But if it has been useful in our endeavors, then I have no cause to complain."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Now then, I shall make you invisible as well, that you might steal close to the dwarves and give them a dose of dream powder."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Even should it fail to put them to sleep outright, it should render them drowsy enough to seek their beds."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Say the word, and I will cast the enchantment."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Ready to begin? Very good."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Should the enchantment fade before you finish tending to all the dwarves, return to me and I will cast it anew."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Need another dose of invisibility, do you?

Think it's enough, or shall I go and dig up some more?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"I daresay it will suffice for our purposes. You have our gratitude, Korutt."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Let us carry this back to...to..."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Are you all right!?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"...Worry not, I shall be fine. Long as I have been away from the Crystarium, a little weakness is to be expected."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"I may have also overexerted myself in the moment.

It's a spineless act befittin' your limp beards!"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"What!? I won't stand for that insult!"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Our beards are soft and luscious and smell like freshly tapped ale! Gogg beards are dry and crusty and smell like a knocker's arse!"},{"name":"GLAGG","text":"Impudent whelp! Better a hobgoblin's nose hairs than the feeble, floppy things you Tholls have hangin' from your faces!"},{"name":"KORUTTANDGLAGG","text":"(-Korutt and Glagg-)Grrrrrr!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Like oil and water...
