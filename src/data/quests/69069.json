Fawning profusely over you and your accomplishments, he begs your aid in finding out what is troubling one Tolas, a member of the Crystarium guard and close companion. Should you be so inclined, accompany the youth to the Ostall Imperative, and lend an ear to the guardsman's troubles.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","You reunite with Mauwyl at the Ostall Imperative. The two of you make your way to Tolas's post, and are quickly taken aback when the stern-looking guardsman at first reacts to your presence with sudden panic and fear. The man apologizes for the overreaction, and explains that he has been feeling fatigued ever since coming back from a particularly harrowing battle with the sin eaters. Tolas then dashes off abruptly, leaving Mauwyl increasingly concerned about his friend's state of mind. The youth suggests that you split up and inquire with Tolas's fellow guardsmen, that you might glean some insight into what weighs on the man's heart.","Speaking with the guardsman, you are able to glean two pieces of information: one, that Tolas is descended from a prominent family of knights, and two, that he suffered the loss of his entire regiment in the recent attack. No doubt Mauwyl will find this knowledge enlightening. Seek him out and share what you know.","You share your findings with Mauwyl, who sympathizes deeply with his friend for the tragedy he faced. He offers you a reward for all you have done for him, and bids you stay and help him talk to Tolas, that the wounds his heart suffered in the battle might yet be healed."],"objectives":["Speak with Mauwyl at the Ostall Imperative.","Ask around about Tolas.","Speak with Mauwyl."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Oh, for woe! I can't take it anymore! Whatever am I do to about him? If only─"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Uwaaah! Don't sneak up on─wait...I know you! You're <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Oh, lucky day! Why, I was just thinking to myself: if only a great hero like <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> were here, <span class=\"emphasis\"><span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span>'d</span> know what to do!"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"You'll help me, yes? Oh, please say you will! Look at me─have you ever seen anyone so pathetic? I have nowhere else to turn! Without you, I'm as good as...as...!"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"...Forgive me. I have a habit of getting ahead of myself. Anyhow, it's both a pleasure and an honor to meet you in the flesh."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"My name is Mauwyl, and I'm a woodcutter by trade. I spend most of my days harvesting lumber from the woodlands that surround the Ostall Imperative."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"In fact, I was making a delivery to the Imperative the other day when the sin eaters attacked. I was cowering in a corner, but I was able to witness your exploits in battle from afar."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Wicked white, I've never seen someone fight like that! How formidable, how fierce, how ferocious you were! Why, I'd wager you're even stronger than Tolas!"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Oh, right. There I go again. Tolas is a friend of mine, you see. Best friend I've known. He's a member of the guard at the Imperative, and a warrior of no small repute. They say people have lost count of how many sin eaters he's slain."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"And yet, for the gods only know what reason, he just hasn't been acting like himself of late. I've asked time and again if anything's the matter, but he just frowns and shakes his head. Perhaps he feels that a humble woodcutter like myself wouldn't understand."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"But you! If a hero like you were to approach him, perhaps he'd feel more comfortable laying his troubles bare. There's no guarantee it'll work, but I daresay it's our best hope!"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"In any event, I'm certain you'd enjoy each other's company. Why, you could regale one another with tales of adventure, discuss strategies and tactics for fighting the sin eaters, and so much more!"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"I was just on my way to pay him a visit at the Imperative. You'll join me there, won't you? It would mean ever so much to me and Tolas both!"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! You came! Tolas's post is just over that way. Come with me─I'll introduce you."},{"name":"TOLAS","text":"........."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Hullo there, Tolas! It's me! And you'll never guess who I brought along..."},{"name":"TOLAS","text":"Wh-Who goes there!? Are we under attack!? Do the sin eaters return!?"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Whoa, now! Settle down there, friend. It's just me, Mauwyl!"},{"name":"TOLAS","text":"...So we are not under attack? That is...a relief."},{"name":"TOLAS","text":"Pray forgive my outburst. Ever since the recent attack, I have been feeling a touch on edge. It would seem that anxiety and fatigue got the better of me."},{"name":"TOLAS","text":"No...this simply will not do! I am descended from a line of the bravest knights in Lakeland! How can I defend the people if I am here jumping at shadows like some skittish child!"},{"name":"TOLAS","text":"It is nigh time for my patrol. Pray leave me to my duties, Mauwyl. If you have something of import that you wish to discuss with me, it can wait until my return. I should not be long."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Tolas, wait! Tolas!"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"I swear, something just isn't right with the man. Don't you get the same impression?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"I must agree."},{"name":"A1","text":"Is he not merely tired?"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"I knew it! You don't even know him and still you can feel it, yes? I worry for the man..."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Trust me on this one, friend. I've known Tolas nearly my whole life, and he's not one to startle so easily...or at all. Ice, not blood, runs through that man's veins."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Something happened to him during that battle, I'm certain of it. But what could it be?"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Perhaps his fellow guardsmen know something. Would you mind helping me ask around?"},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Thanks, friend! I knew I could count on you. Let's split up and see what we can figure out by the time Tolas returns from making his rounds."},{"name":"TAOTISTT","text":"Tolas? Why, he's one of the bravest men I've ever known! One of the mightiest warriors, as well! When the sin eaters struck, his regiment bore the brunt of the attack. A lesser man would never have made it back alive!"},{"name":"TAOTISTT","text":"It's no surprise, though. After all, he's descended from one of the most prominent lines of knights in all of Lakeland! Why, they say his great-grandfather served under Ser Ostall himself. Talk about a pedigree!"},{"name":"SEANARD","text":"Tolas? Aye, I pity the man. Or didn't ye hear? Word has it he was the only one from his regiment to make it back alive."},{"name":"SEANARD","text":"His men fought valiantly at his side, they did. But in the end, he watched every last one of them fall. A cruel twist of fate for such a brave leader of men."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"I'll see what this fellow knows. Why don't you go around and see if any of the soldiers here heard word of the battle?"},{"name":"TAOTISTT","text":"I may never be Tolas's equal on the battlefield, but just being able to serve with a knight of his pedigree is an honor beyond belief! Mark my words: as long as he stands with us, the Imperative will never fall!"},{"name":"SEANARD","text":"Aye, if I lost my whole regiment to the sin eaters, I don't know how I'd go on. Tolas is a braver man than I'll ever be, but he's still a man. No doubt the events of that day took a toll on him."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Drat! Drat it all! I've been asking around, but these guards won't even give me the time of day! I hope you've fared better than I."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"What's this? Tolas lost his entire regiment in the attack, you say!? No wonder he hasn't been himself since that day! "},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Thank you, friend. This certainly puts matters in a different light. But what can we do to ease his burden? That's the question."},{"name":"MAUWYL","text":"Oh! Before I forget, this is for you. Consider it a token of thanks for coming all the way here to help my friend.
