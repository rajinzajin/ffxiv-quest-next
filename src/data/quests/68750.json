{"quest":{"name":"A Harmony from the Heavens","location":"South Shroud","id":68750,"patch":5.0,"sort":800,"icon":100877,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1006750,"target":1030081,"genre":151,"journal":["Jehantel is at once jubilant and relieved to see you.","The rumors of your recent trials have had Jehantel worried for you, and apparently he isn't the only one. The old bard invites you to accompany him to New Gridania, there to meet your friend Captain Sanson Smyth and set his mind at ease.","After expressing his delight at seeing you again, Sanson informs you that he and his unit also took to battle at the Ghimlyt Dark. However, the relatively inexperienced bards struggled with their songs when they were hard-pressed. With Guydelot unwilling to instruct his juniors, Jehantel suggests that the two of you put on a performance for them, that they might experience a song brimming with heart. It is decided that Guydelot will also take part, and you set out to find him in Nine Ivies in the East Shroud.","According to Pukno Poki, Guydelot has ventured deep into the woods. Believing that the willful bard is most likely to respond to you, Jehantel bids you call out to him. With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, enter “Guydelot” to yell out to your comrade at the designated location in Nine Ivies.","You yell out Guydelot's name at the top of your lungs, but the only response is silence. Perhaps you should try again deeper in the woods. With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, enter “Guydelot” to yell out to your comrade at the designated location in Nine Ivies.","At last, Guydelot reveals himself, and you inform him of the performance. The bard agrees on account of the rare opportunity to perform with you, and the stage is set for the Sea of Clouds. Sanson instructs you to gather at the airship landing in Gridania while he seeks his superiors' permission to use a vessel.","With the airship secured, your party sets out for the Sea of Clouds, to the place where your journey for the Ballad of Oblivion reached its end. With the heavens as your backdrop, you give a heartfelt performance of a piece written by Jehantel and inspired by your own adventures. The song moves your small audience nigh to tears, helping the recruits to understand that which is most important to a bard. Its lesson also moves Sanson to try to better understand Guydelot, and he convinces his friend to guide his juniors in his own time.","Back at the airship landing, Sanson reiterates his desire to help his men become the best bards they can be, before running off in pursuit of the ever free-spirited Guydelot. This leaves you alone with Jehantel, who thanks you for the sublime experience of performing with you. The song, born of your collaboration, woke memories of the passion he had in his youth. And generations hence, your erstwhile mentor believes, it will still be sung, awakening passion in countless more souls."],"objectives":["Speak with Sanson in Gridania.","Speak with Jehantel in the East Shroud.","With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, enter “Guydelot” to call out to your comrade.","Speak with Sanson at the airship landing in Gridania.","Speak with Sanson."],"dialogue":[{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Ah, young one, full glad am I to see you hale and whole. The rumors from the front lines had me quite worried."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"I would commemorate this happy reunion with a verse, but there is someone who has worried for you even more than I."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"I speak, of course, of your comrade Sanson. It would do him well to see you again. If you can spare the time, perhaps we can pay him visit in Gridania together."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"It would do Sanson well to see you again. If you can spare the time, let us pay him visit in Gridania together."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Lest you wonder, those men are Sanson's bards─and my former pupils."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, praise the Matron you're safe! I've been beside myself with worry ever since I heard of your mysterious disappearance after Ghimlyt!"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"We fought the Empire too, my unit and I. Never had I experienced such a bloody battle."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"You have done well to return to us, all of you."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"We owe our survival in no small part to Guydelot. His song spurred all whom it reached on the battlefield, turning the tide on countless occasions."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"For his valorous service, he was awarded a medal from the Alliance. Not that he was ever interested in such trinkets, of course."},{"name":"NOVICEBARD03214","text":"(-Novice Bard-)Lieutenant Guydelot was an inspiration to us all. But us... We may as well not have been present, for all the good we did..."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"May I introduce to you our recruits, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. They are...disappointed with their showing at Ghimlyt."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"To be sure, they did not shame themselves─far from it. But in moments when we were hard-pressed, their songs faltered and lost power."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"I see. As you know, our songs are given power through our fervent desire to aid our comrades."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"I do not think that you lacked this desire. It was simply overwhelmed by the terror of being confronted with death."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"In his capacity as their senior, I had wanted Guydelot to train them. But no matter how many times I asked him─nay, commanded─he refuses to do so, saying that their songs do not have heart..."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Is that what he said?"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Not to discourage you all, but there may be truth to Guydelot's words."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Remember─if a song is to touch the heart, it must needs have heart. Without it, not even an expertly performed anthem can hope to inspire."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"I believe it would behoove you to experience an exemplar of our songs. And most conveniently, we have an exemplar of our art here with us."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, will you not play for them?"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Allow me to beseech you as well, my friend. Guydelot and I have spoken highly of your deeds to the recruits. It would be no exaggeration to say that they idolize you."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Rest assured you won't perform alone. My harp shall join yours for a duet awash with heart."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"I am truly grateful. Yet if I may be particular, we should have Guydelot participate as well. It is his duty to train them, after all."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"And besides...I believe he would relish the chance to perform with the two of you."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Very well, a trio it is! Pukno Poki mentioned catching sight of Guydelot in the East Shroud. Let us see if we can find him there."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"The recruits? They're waiting in Gridania, lest they scare Guydelot away with the prospect of having to teach them."},{"name":"PUKNOPOKI","text":"Long time no see! You haven't forgotten me, I hope? After all, I'm the one who discovered your talents, kupo!"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"It appears Guydelot was here but recently."},{"name":"PUKNOPOKI","text":"That's right, kupo! He went deeper into the woods, saying, “That Sanson nags like a bloody fishwife!”"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Guydelot respects you more than anyone, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Were you to call to him, I daresay he will answer."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Do I really nag like a fishwife...?"},{"name":"PUKNOPOKI","text":"The more things change, the more Guydelot stays the same, kupo!"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"If you were to call out to Guydelot, I daresay he will answer.

But I can't say no to you, now can I? What's this errand, then?"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Hah, I've been waiting forever for you to ask me that! So, what's the occasion?"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Ugh, so Sanson and Jehantel put you up to it. I should've known..."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Those recruits are as stiff as their captain and I don't have any hopes for them...but all right, I'll do it. Anything's worth the chance to perform with you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Guydelot, there you are!"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"I take it <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> has apprised you of the performance."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Aye, and I expect no less than the finest venue for this distinguished gathering. You'll secure such a place for us, right, Chief?"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"You may depend on it. I myself want the very best for the performance."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Do any locations come to mind?"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"The recruits have shown great interest in our expedition to find the Ballad of Oblivion."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"In light of this, I believe there is no place more fitting than the Sea of Clouds. The view alone would take their breath away."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Sounds good to me! Let's get moving!"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Very well, I will go and secure an airship for us. Please gather at the airship landing."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Bugger me, but I'm starting to get excited!"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Heh heh, I can't rightly recall when last I felt so enthused for a performance."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"My superiors raised their eyebrows when I mentioned another journey to the Sea of Clouds, but I managed to win them over with the prospect of another song of power. We have our airship."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"If everyone is ready, let us be away. The recruits have already boarded, keen as they are. And who wouldn't be keen for the coming performance?"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"So, what's the plan? What're we going to play to this azure backdrop?"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Well, seeing as we have a vaunted hero with us, I had a mind to draw inspiration from <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> adventures for a new piece."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"That's a great idea, old man! <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s stories would make for a bloody fine song!"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Our recruits yet have limited experience lifting up their comrades in battle. A song that conveys the importance of camaraderie, that sows the seeds of the desire to inspire─such would be ideal, I believe."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What should the song be about?"},{"name":"A1","text":"A young man who chased after a legend."},{"name":"A2","text":"A forgotten hero who avenged her comrades."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"An intrepid soul who faced a mighty foe, staunch comrades in tow... Aye, this is a rousing tale, worthy of being immortalized in song. Why, already the themes and emotions weave themselves into melody and verse in my mind."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Come, my friends! Let us lift our voices together in heartfelt harmony!"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"O wayward son, you left hearth and home,<br>To write your own tale and live on in tomes.♪<br>Guided by a legend, a hero fallen from grace,<br>Onward you forged, resolve writ on your face.♪"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"O wayward son, you embarked upon your quest,<br>At your side a comrade to aid you in the test.♪<br>But even with this hero serving as your sword,<br>Hubris was your enemy, estrangement your reward.♪"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"O wayward son, you cast away your pride,<br>Shedding with the past that had shackled you inside.♪<br>To the truth before you, you opened up your eyes,<br>To finally see where your duty truly lies.♪"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"O huntress brave, for vengeance you did cry,<br>For comrades slain in a hunt gone awry.♪<br>In your breast a raging storm, impossible to quell,<br>Save by consigning the beast to the depths of hell.♪"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"O huntress brave, your quarry you did chase,<br>Though it meant forsaking your newfound place.♪<br>By your own hands you wished the deed fulfilled,<br>That the storm within may finally be stilled.♪"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"O huntress brave, a decision you did make,<br>Your hopes and dreams, on friendship you would stake.♪<br>Laying bare your heart, you set yourself free,<br>To give your all to others, that the world may ever be.♪"},{"name":"NOVICEBARD03214","text":"By the gods... So this is what it means to perform with all your heart..."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"That was moving beyond words. I felt the lesson of the song with my whole being─the lesson that our understanding for one another is what opens the way forward."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Understanding... To think on it, I may have been too insistent in trying to press our recruits onto Guydelot. I didn't try to understand his feelings."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Guydelot, this isn't an order, but a humble request. I ask not that you train our recruits, but that you simply get to know them. Through this, you'll come to understand each other's hearts─and forge a bond that will lend power to your songs."},{"name":"NOVICEBARD03214","text":"We should like that very much! Your song touched us to the very core, and we'd like nothing more than to be able to likewise touch others!"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"All right, then. We can get acquainted when I'm in the mood. Now that you know what a real song feels like, I reckon there's hope for you lot yet."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Your adventures make great songs, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"That was a performance I shan't soon forget. My breast still thrums from the joy of the experience."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"I cannot thank you enough, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Our recruits are more motivated than ever before. No sooner did we arrive back in Gridania than they rushed off to train."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"I believe I'll go and join them. I'll continue what you and Jehantel started, and help them to become the finest bards they can be."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Guydelot─you are coming too, yes? You did say you would get to know them."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Aye, when I'm in the mood─which I'm not. Right now, I need to reflect on my experience─let it really soak in, you know? So I'm going to spend some time alone with my harp."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"W-Wait! If you're going to play the harp, at least let the recruits listen!"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Forgive me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but I must be away. Thank you for a wonderful performance!"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Passionate as they are, I doubt not but that they will find their way."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Allow me to thank you as well, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Truth be told, I too had longed to perform with you for quite some time."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"It was a truly sublime experience, as if our music had floated to the heavens and rained down upon all creation."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"The music of that rain, I believe, reached the souls of the fallen. My departed comrades of the Gods' Quiver."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"As it reached the heart of an old man who has long lived in quiet penance. It woke memories of the passion I had in my youth, when I yet stood on the field of battle."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"All of this because of a single song, young one. A song born of your tale."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Generations hence, full certain am I that the song will still be sung, awakening passion in countless more souls. It gives me great pride to know that I was a part of its creation."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Guydelot"}],"reward":{"gil":1748,"items":[{"id":25187},{"id":25188},{"id":25189}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":24}],"questsType":"all","quests":[68430,68814]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006750","obj":{"i":1006750,"n":"Jehantel","l":56,"q":11}},{"type":"npc","id":"1030081","obj":{"i":1030081,"n":"Sanson","l":52,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"25187","obj":{"i":25187,"n":"Heavens' Eye Materia VII","l":420,"c":20274,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":6,"value":8,"attr":"Direct Hit Rate","category":0}}},{"type":"item","id":"25188","obj":{"i":25188,"n":"Savage Aim Materia VII","l":420,"c":20274,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":6,"value":8,"attr":"Critical Hit","category":0}}},{"type":"item","id":"25189","obj":{"i":25189,"n":"Savage Might Materia VII","l":420,"c":20274,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":6,"value":8,"attr":"Determination","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68430","obj":{"i":68430,"n":"Sweet Dreams Are Made of Peace","g":151,"l":"Gridania","s":700,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68814","obj":{"i":68814,"n":"Courage Born of Fear","g":181,"l":"Kholusia","s":351,"f":1}}]}
