Yet even if we must search every alleyway, we will find them!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"It's big, I'll grant you. But cluttered city streets are far more conducive to infiltration than wide-open spaces. This will work to our advantage. Trust me."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"You'd think all those tall, dark buildings would be frightening, but for some reason they just make me feel sad..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"One cannot blame the Ondo for fleeing the spectacle of these brooding edifices. We, however, have not the luxury of fear..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"We have found our destination, but how to descend into the city itself...?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It's intimidating, yes, but we have to start somewhere..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Why don't we have a closer look at that tower to the southeast? We might be able to reach it from the edge of the trench."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Look at the size of those doors... Now I know how pixies must feel."},{"name":"ELEVATOR03652","text":"(-Echoing Voice-)<span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span> recognized...<br>Welcome to the city of Amaurot."},{"name":"ELEVATOR03652","text":"(-Echoing Voice-)Will you be riding the lift?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Wh─!? Did the building just <span class=\"emphasis\">welcome</span> you?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Mayhap it is not so passing strange... Did Emet-Selch not invite <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> to visit his abode?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"'Tis plain thy coming was expected."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"And where will this lift be taking us?"},{"name":"ELEVATOR03652","text":"(-Echoing Voice-)The lift services every level of Achora Heights, but is presently configured to convey passengers directly to the ground floor."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Well, there you have it. In the absence of some few hundred yalms of rope, we have little choice but to accept the offer."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"With emphasis on the <span class=\"emphasis\">we</span>. I'm not about to let you walk into that place alone."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"I wish to ride the lift."},{"name":"A1","text":"Ground floor.

Even a gigas would feel inadequate in such surroundings."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Seems peaceful enough─he said, tempting fate."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I just can't believe how tall everything is!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"If mine eyes do not deceive, we stand in some manner of communal square..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Just a moment. I thought I saw something."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Descend to the ground floor of Achora Heights?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It's only at this distance that you start to realize just how big the buildings truly are... What did that voice call the city? “Amaurot”?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Look! Over there!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Is that...a person? Ah, no, my mistake. That's a giant."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"It doesn't seem to have noticed us yet..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Giant or no, a resident of this place may have much and more to tell us. I say we make the first move."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Alphinaud, you can't just─ Ugh!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Pray excuse my boldness, but might I ask you a few questions...?"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Oh, what adorable costumes. Are you children on an excursion? This district has much to teach you.</span>"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"How odd... That sounded like no language I've ever heard, and yet I understood every word..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Just as he understood us."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Ahem. And which district is this, exactly?"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">You must be lost, poor things.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">You stand in the Polyleritae District, wherein lie the institutions most vital to the management of our star.</span>"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you ask?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Can you tell us where to find Emet-Selch?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Can you tell us who rules this city?"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Ah, I see. You've come to marvel at the workings of the Convocation of Fourteen.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Who rules...? What a curious question. Mayhap you refer to our supervising body, the Convocation of Fourteen?</span>"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"So Emet-Selch <span class=\"emphasis\">isn't</span> the leader here..."},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Emet-Selch is a member of the Convocation. Were you hoping to witness its deeds firsthand?</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Hm hm hm... Hardly surprising, I suppose. The whole world holds its breath as the Final Days draw near, and our brightest minds race to implement their plans.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">...Thus you must understand that gaining an audience at this time will be next to impossible.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">You should hurry home now, before your families begin to worry. Do you need me to walk you back?</span>"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"N-No thank you. We will be fine."},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENT03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Very well. Take care, little ones...</span>"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"What was that all about...?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"To my eyes, these people appear as arcane entities. I suspect Emet-Selch wove them from aether, much as he reconstructed the rest of the city..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"The Final Days..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Such words well befit the oblivion described to us by our Ascian foe."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"A catastrophe of unprecedented scale, which did set in motion the summoning of Zodiark...and thence Hydaelyn Herself."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"But...that happened centuries and centuries ago, didn't it?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"That man spoke as if they were rushing to avert a disaster here and now."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Unless... For these people, the distant past <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> the here and now!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I believe thou hast the right of it, Master Alphinaud. This aetherial Amaurot and its residents appear to be phantoms of a different age."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Emet-Selch hath resurrected a memory─a moment in time from before the star was sundered."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"So, we find ourselves in a long-destroyed city inhabited by the long-departed. An unusual situation, to be sure─but at least we're able to parley with these ancients."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"...In fact, they seem downright eager to chat. I say we use this to our advantage─split up, strike up some conversations, and see if we can't learn the location of our quarry."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"And while we're at it, it wouldn't hurt to wheedle out a few more details regarding this Convocation of Fourteen and their impending disaster."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"To mingling, then. Let's meet back here when our jaws start aching."},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTA03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Hm? 'Twould seem the Hall is host to a most precocious visitor this day. And what, pray tell, shall be the subject of our discussion, young one?</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTA03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Ah...the Convocation and their handling of the coming peril. 'Tis only natural that you should have questions.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTA03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Shall we begin with the members themselves? As all know, the Fourteen are the wisest and most puissant among us. They are the stewards of order, responsible for decisions which keep this star turning season after season.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTA03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Be it the speaker, Lahabrea, or the emissary, Elidibus, each seat is occupied by an elected sage of surpassing intellect.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTA03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Loghrif, Mitron, Emet-Selch... Their individual titles have, as a gesture of respect and a matter of tradition, become synonymous with their incumbents.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTA03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Thus it is with great incredulity that I greet this recent rumor that a seat in the Convocation is soon to be left vacant.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTA03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">If proven true, 'twould be an unprecedented development─and testament to the immense pressure under which our saviors are toiling... In any event, I for one am confident they shall deliver our star unto salvation.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTB03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Good gracious, child, where is your family? You should not be alone at a time like this. Run along home. Quickly now!</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTB03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Have you not heard? Though yet confined to the lands across the sea, a terrible phenomenon afflicts our star. They are calling it the “Final Days.”</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTB03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">'Tis said it starts suddenly, a cacophonous keening from beneath the earth. The sound distorts all living things within earshot, and wrests from us control of our creation magicks.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTB03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Once that happens, all is lost. Fear, pain, despair...every dread impulse is siphoned from our minds and given substance: an eternal fall of fiery rain; an incessant spawning of nightmarish beasts...</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTB03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">None can point to the source of the phenomenon. 'Tis as if the star itself has fallen ill─as if a force inimical to life now festers and spreads.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTB03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">'Tis only a matter of time until Amaurot, too, resounds to that discordant squall. You should stay with your loved ones, child... Stay with them...</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTC03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">An audience with Emet-Selch? I am afraid you have the wrong office, little one. And besides, he will be far too busy to field the questions of curious children.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTC03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">Surely you have been told of the looming catastrophe? Every resource available to the Convocation must be spent upon ensuring our world survives.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTC03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">They have yet to make an official announcement, but it is said the Fourteen are moving forward with a plan of scarce credible proportions─one which promises to grant <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> to the very star itself!</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTC03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">They will invoke our mightiest spells of creation to birth an entity of all-encompassing magnificence...and then they will rewrite the laws of existence.</span>"},{"name":"AMAUROTRESIDENTC03652","text":"<span class=\"highlight-purple\">'Tis a huge undertaking, and it <span class=\"emphasis\">must</span> be completed ere the corruption spreads this far. Thus I say to you again: do not hold out hope for an audience...</span>"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, that was an experience. I was never very fond of being treated like a child, but it did make asking questions less suspicious."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. If I was not certain before, then I am now─the people of this city believe they face the end of the world."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I cannot imagine what purpose compelled Emet-Selch to recreate this ancient “Amaurot.”"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And yet...I fancy I hear his words to us echoing throughout this ocean trench.
