Before you begin your preparations, Slafborn suggests that you seek the aid of one Glaumunt, who he says has a personal agenda against the Empire.","You have informed Glaumunt of your intent to infiltrate Castrum Centri. If his response is any indication, it would seem you can indeed expect his aid."],"objectives":["Speak with Slafborn at Revenant's Toll.","Speak with Glaumunt."],"dialogue":[{"name":"CID","text":"Thanks to you, Biggs and Wedge are with us again."},{"name":"CID","text":"Now we must find a way to rescue Minfilia and the others. Gods know we've kept them waiting too long already."},{"name":"CID","text":"Based on what we've learned, I believe it's safe to say they're being held at Castrum Centri."},{"name":"CID","text":"So let us convene at Revenant's Toll in Mor Dhonaâ”€'tis as good a place as any to prepare, and better than most. The road leading east then south will get you there."},{"name":"CID","text":"When we arrive, let us seek the advice of the local adventurers. We're bound to learn a thing or two that will benefit our mission."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"Well met, friend. What brings you to Revenant's Toll?"},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"...Did I hear you rightly? Your friends are being held captive at Castrum Centri, and you want to rescue them? I don't mean to discourage you, but that might prove...difficult."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"The stronghold has been on high alert of late, with armored patrols seen about the perimeter around the clock. Not even a fly could get within a hundred yalms of the walls undetected."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"If the Garleans were alerted to our coming, we cannot know what they will do to Minfilia and the others. We must act with the greatest stealth."},{"name":"CID","text":"Aye, it has to be good old-fashioned infiltration."},{"name":"YDA","text":"But with security so tight, how are we going to smuggle ourselves in?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Why, I've a mind to walk through the front door."},{"name":"YDA","text":"Huh? The front door?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Aye, we'll disguise ourselves as imperial troops and march right in."},{"name":"CID","text":"For this, we'll need a few sets of imperial uniforms, a suit of magitek armor, and impeccable timing."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"Heh, that's a bold strategy, but it just might work. Where we are, there's certainly no shortage of opportunities to <span class=\"emphasis\">borrow</span> the equipment."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"Knowing those imperial bastards, they won't even suspect that we savage Eorzeans would think to use their technology."},{"name":"CID","text":"Then it's settled!"},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"If you're determined to go ahead with this, I'd recommend you speak with Glaumunt."},{"name":"SLAFBORN","text":"The fellow's got a personal grudge against the Empire, and happens to know a deal about Castrum Centri besides. I've no doubt that he'd want to be of aid."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Yda and I shall go to reconnoiter Garlean activity at the stronghold. It would not do if something were to befall our comrades before we had the chance to act."},{"name":"YDA","text":"Come and join us when you're ready, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Let's do this!"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Sometimes I wonder, Yda...
