{"quest":{"name":"The Legend of Musosai","location":"Kugane","id":68759,"patch":5.0,"sort":800,"icon":100886,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1022184,"target":1030622,"genre":160,"journal":["Makoto looks to be preparing for a journey.","Makoto informs you that she is about to depart for Eorzea in order to visit Musosai's grave. Believing the timing of your arrival to be fortuitous, she invites you to accompany her on the journey, and you are happy to oblige. Upon arriving in Ul'dah, she says that she will first call on your showmaster friend, Momozigo, at the Quicksand.","You and Makoto come to the Quicksand, but Momozigo is presently absent. For now, you decide to continue on to the Silver Bazaar, where Musosai was laid to rest.","At the Silver Bazaar, Makoto cannot help but notice the presence of folk attired as samurai. While the observation is indeed curious, you set them aside in your mind for now and proceed to Musosai's grave.","Kneeling before Musosai's grave, Makoto tells him of your victory over Ugetsu and his insurgents. No sooner does she finish her report than a commotion breaks out nearby, and she instinctively dashes off to investigate. Catching up to her, you are met with the sight of a familiar-looking Roegadyn. The man takes exception at those who are dressed as samurai, saying that they sully Musosai's memory. As soon as he sees you, however, he flees the scene as if his life depended on it. Her interest piqued by the fact that he knows both you and Musosai, Makoto decides to give chase, and you follow on her heels in the direction of the docks.","It doesn't take long for you and Makoto to corner the mystery man, who is revealed to be none other than Ostyrgrein, the bodyguard you defeated on the deck of a ship once upon a time. He claims he has since mended his ways, and desiring to become a true samurai, has taken to visiting Musosai's grave daily. Recently, however, someone has been telling the tale of Musosai's quest to right wrongs, which resulted in the Silver Bazaar becoming something of a tourist attraction. This led to his earlier outburst, which in turn led you and Makoto to him. Ostyrgrein then begs you to take him on as his pupil, but you are reluctant to do so. Sensing his determination, Makoto invites him to come to Kugane to train, and he happily accepts. Before they depart for the Far East, however, Makoto suggests returning once more to the Quicksand, where she believes another familiar face may be found telling a familiar tale.","As Makoto had suspected, the storyteller who has been spreading the tale of Musosai's deeds is none other than Momozigo, and he begins another session soon after you arrive. You listen intently as he dramatically recounts your journey with your former master, the words bringing your memories of that time back to vivid life. Afterwards, you share with him your recent adventures in the First, that he might add to his repertoire. Having bid Makoto and Ostyrgrein farewell, Momozigo urges you to keep up fighting the good fight, that Musosai's legacy might live on not only in you, but in others besides."],"objectives":["Speak with Makoto in Ul'dah.","Speak with Makoto at the Silver Bazaar.","Speak with Makoto.","Speak with the familiar fellow.","Speak with Makoto in Ul'dah."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, how good of you to pay me visit, and now of all times!"},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"You see, I'm about to depart for Eorzea to visit Master Musosai's grave, to tell him of our victory over Ugetsu."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"That you should come to me at this juncture is most fortuitous.

Falser than I ever was!"},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"I had the honor of knowing Master Musosai. And the Master Musosai I knew would be glad if his tale inspired others to follow in his footsteps."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"And though he was a solitary man, he did not spurn the company of others.

Many answered his call, but none had an answer to his transcendent swordsmanship. For a time, it seemed that he would go undefeated..."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"But there came one unassuming adventurer. Wielding the katana, a foreign weapon <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> had theretofore never held, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> fought with heart and skill to claim victory!"},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"After journeying the realm over, vanquishing evil together, never could the adventurer have imagined that, for <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> final test, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> must vanquish Musosai himself."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"Left with no recourse, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> drew <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> katana and faced <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> friend and master."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"A grueling battle unfolded, with neither side yielding a single ilm. The adventurer brought <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> all to bear, but <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> was matched at every turn by Musosai, who unleashed technique after deadly technique, betraying no signs of the illness that ravaged his body."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"But at the end of a contest of equals, it was the younger samurai who dealt the final blow to emerge the victor. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Her</span><span class=\"alternative\">His</span></span> master had trained <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> well."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"As he lay battered and bloodied on the snow, Musosai demanded that his pupil finish it.

The blade traced a vicious arc!"},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"...And cleaved empty air. The adventurer had excised the evil in Musosai, as Musosai himself had done for those who could yet be redeemed."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"So it was that the elderly samurai found peace in his final moment. It is said that his soul now rests atop the cliff by the Silver Bazaar, where he gazes out at the setting sun."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"And somewhere out there, the young adventurer continues <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> noble master's legacy, fighting for justice and vanquishing evil wheresoever it should exist."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"So ends my taleâ”€the Legend of Musosai.

Well, during my trip to Kugane, I had the chance to hear a storyteller at the Mujikoza.

I pray that you will continue to share the tale of Master Musosai with all the world."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"You can depend on it!

This will be a splendid addition to my tales!"},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"I'm afraid it is time we sought our ship. Brief though it was, I'm glad for our reunion."},{"name":"OSTYRGREIN","text":"I'm gonna train hard in Hingashi, an' I'm gonna come back a real samurai! Jus' you watch!"},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"If your travels should bring you to Kugane again, please come and seek me out at the barracks. Till next time..."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"To think that pretender would have a change of heart and try to become a true samurai... The old man will be pleased."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"It goes to show, Musosai's legacy truly lives on in you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.
