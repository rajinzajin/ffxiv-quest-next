I say, is it your stomach which drew you here? For I am just setting about the business of dispensing meals."},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"So much has transpired in so little time, 'tis hardly a wonder that so few citizens can sleep for more than a fistful of hours. And that is why I have taken it upon myself to feed these people with an Ishgardian soup, one that always helped calm my nerves when I was a child."},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"Though it won't fix all that ails these poor souls, it may prove to be some comfort, surely. Here's the rub, though: I lack the hands needed to see it delivered in a timely manner... Might you assist me?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Of course."},{"name":"A1","text":"I'll pass."},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"O-Oh, of course. Silly of me to ask in the first place, I suppose. Should you change your mind, though, I will be here for a while yet."},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"You will? You are a hero of the people indeed! Here are three bowls of piping hot soup. Could you see that those around the station who appear especially woebegone receive some?"},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"No doubt a few of the citizens you encounter will try to insist they can do without, but let's not take no for an answer!"},{"name":"MALLIUS","text":"What in the world is <span class=\"emphasis\">that</span>? For pity's sake, get it away from me. You'll make me sick with that foreign trash you louts call food."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"It will warm you right up."},{"name":"A2","text":"It's a recipe from cold climes. It may be to your liking."},{"name":"MALLIUS","text":"Oh enough. What are you, some two-gil salesman? I'll take the damnable thing if it'll shut you up."},{"name":"MALLIUS","text":"Oh. Oh my, that is nice, isn't it? And so warm..."},{"name":"MALLIUS","text":"The hells are you looking at, then? I got my food, now off with you. What, afraid I'll run off with the bowl, are you? I'm not <span class=\"emphasis\">that</span> hard up as to resort to stealing. I can get it back to the cook just fine on my own."},{"name":"MALLIUS","text":"I told you I'd get the bowl back to you later, didn't I? Just want to make sure I don't leave even a drop behind... This is good stuff."},{"name":"POPPAEA","text":"What is this? Soup, you say? That's very kind of you."},{"name":"POPPAEA","text":"It's been far too long since I had a hot meal. Can't rightly remember the last time."},{"name":"POPPAEA","text":"Let me guess, this is an Ishgardian recipe, isn't it? My mother used to make something similar, once upon a time. It was a red soup well known in these parts."},{"name":"POPPAEA","text":"Thank you for bringing me this reminder of happier days─days I hope to see returned to our country."},{"name":"POPPAEA","text":"I would love to have more of this again. Only if there's enough to go around, that is."},{"name":"CITIZENC04231","text":"So first you march into our homeland, easy as you please, and now you tell us what foods we're to eat? Oh, that's very rich. Very rich, indeed! "},{"name":"CITIZENC04231","text":"But let me tell you something, you little weasel. I spit on your charity, you hear? Spit on it. So you can take that soup of yours and stuff it where the sun don't shine!"},{"name":"MALLIUS","text":"Hm, maybe I'll grab some more when I bring the bowl back. Huh? No, I wasn't talkin' to you. Shoo!"},{"name":"POPPAEA","text":"Someone's providing soup to the hungry, are they? How very charitable. Perhaps they would like some help."},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"Ah, there you are. So, how did you fare? Did you manage to deliver the soup like I asked?"},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"Oh, turned away by one surly citizen, were you? That's unfortunate, although not entirely surprising. The people here have been through more than most."},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"I'm not a stranger entire to their pain. When Ishgard was in dire straits, I too found myself fatigued beyond measure, my spirits in the doldrums. I was hanging on by a quickly unraveling thread, it felt, and hope was nothing more than a risible dream."},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"But it was at the Holy Stables when a woman─one I had never before met─offered me a simple bowl of soup. I was in such a dark, foul mood at the time, but...one sip was enough to turn my whole world around. I felt alive again, like I had purpose once more."},{"name":"ISHGARDIANSOLDIER04231","text":"I thought to emulate that charity, do for these people what that kindly lady did for me. But you know what they say: even the best laid plans and all that. Well, I won't let one fractious local dampen my spirits. I'm only sorry you had to deal with them!"}],"reward":{"gil":735},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69929]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1040646","obj":{"i":1040646,"n":"Temple Knight","l":3710,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69929","obj":{"i":69929,"n":"Strange Bedfellows","g":11,"l":"Garlemald","s":547}}]}
