Check in with his daughter Ysabel and a couple of the patrolling sentries, Blaisette and Monne. They may remember what the old storyteller has forgotten.","You have gleaned that the sylphs are known for their mischievous and capricious nature, as they show little regard for Gridanian propriety or etiquette. Share your rediscovered tales with Rolfe Hawthorne.","Your findings have served to stir Rolfe's memory, and he recalls that dancing is the traditional greeting among the sylphs. It would seem they are a most curious tribe, indeed."],"objectives":["Speak with Ysabel.","Speak with Blaisette.","Speak with Monne.","Report to Rolfe Hawthorne."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ROLFE","text":"Come to learn a thing or two about the sylphs, have you? I'll tell you one thing, they're a peculiar folk. How peculiar, you ask? Well, just let me tell you!"},{"name":"ROLFE","text":"They're... They're... Er... &lt;sigh&gt; Beg pardon, friend. My memory's just not what it used to be. I've seen much and more in my adventuring days, and it's all a clutter in my noggin now. Though, I've shared my stories with those around the hut before. You might have more luck with them."},{"name":"YSABEL","text":"The sylphs? Yes, Father's told me his stories <span class=\"emphasis\">plenty</span> of times.

Tee hee!"},{"name":"BLAISETTE","text":"The quickest way to a Quiverwoman's heart might be through her stomach, but don't even think of trying to foist your foodstuffs on a sylph. They sustain themselves simply by bathing in the sun, or so Rolfe once told me."},{"name":"MONNE","text":"The sylphs? Inveterate tricksters and troublemakers, that's what they are! One day they're drawing morbol faces on our masks, the next they're sending our young sentries falling to the bottom of a ravine!"},{"name":"MONNE","text":"Tell them to stop and they just laugh at you. Rolfe claims they harbor no ill will, but I daresay such pranks are no laughing matter."},{"name":"ROLFE","text":"Oh, of course, of course! Hearing your stories─well, <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> stories─has brought the memories flooding back to me. I feel...I feel like <span class=\"emphasis\">dancing</span>!"},{"name":"ROLFE","text":"Yes, nothing brings people together quite like a little toe-tapping. A sylph told me long ago that dancing is a time-honored greeting among their kind.
