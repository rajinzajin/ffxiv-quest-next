In this state, we'll not be mounting an assault on Castellum Velodyna or anywhere else."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"We need to be honest with ourselves about our prospects. But first, we need to put our affairs here in order. Afterwards, I'll join you all at Castrum Oriens."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Understood. We will go and speak with General Aldynn."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I can see the Reach means a lot to these people...but it would be suicide to stay."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"For more than a decade, the Resistance has resided here, hidden from the eyes of the Empire. And just when we set our sights on Velodyna, they strike. Do you not find that passing strange?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Pipin has already departed with the wounded, has he? Good. We have completed our search of the Reach and the surrounding area."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"As far as we can tell, Zenos and his men returned straightways to Specula Imperatoris after quitting this place. 'Twould seem he's lost interest in us."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Which brings us to the most troubling question of all─not how he found us, but why he chose to spare our lives having done so."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"In war, you kill or capture your enemy. You don't leave him to fight another day. Only a fool would turn his back and walk away...but Zenos is no fool."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Whatever his motive, this is neither the time nor the place to think on it. I will leave a token force to watch over the Reach. The rest will fall back to Castrum Oriens. We can discuss our path forward there."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"How in Llymlaen's name did they find the Reach? I thought their glamours were impenetrable."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"I have called upon Stillglade Fane to send every available conjurer, no matter how inexperienced, to help with the wounded. I pray it will be enough."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Krile is with Y'shtola. She still hasn't woken up, but...Krile says she's through the worst."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Given the severity of her wound, we could have hoped for no more. Let us pray she makes a full recovery."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We lost a lot of good people, didn't we..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I saw it happen. When that Skulls commander cut down Meffrid. A single blow, and that was it."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Everything he fought for, all his hopes and dreams for the future. Gone in an instant. And do you want to know the worst part? It wasn't a Garlean who did it─it was an <span class=\"emphasis\">Ala Mhigan</span>."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Gods help me, if I <span class=\"emphasis\">ever</span>─<br>No. Not now. Not while the General's waiting."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Oh, Lyse..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"So we fight on, come what may. Sentiment notwithstanding, what other choice did we have?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"If the rumors are to be believed, this is not the first time Zenos has “spared” his foes. They say he abides by an unusual code, and takes pleasure in the fight. Whatever his reasons, we must use this time to our advantage."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"We've got a long road ahead of us...but it all begins with the first step."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"We'll stay in the Reach and rebuild. We'll reinforce our defenses. And if they come again, we'll be ready."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"I wish you well on your journey, my friend. Let us pray that when we meet again, our fortunes will be much changed."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I can't deny a part of me wants to stay and fight... But I know I'd be more use to you and the others."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"You've said your piece, yes? Now would you please return to bed? You'll never recover if you carry on like this!"},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; Ye gods, the pain... It seemed like a good idea at the time..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It goes without saying, but the Scions alone have not the strength to topple a provincial government, here or anywhere else."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And I am quite certain the same can be said of the Doman Liberation Front. Nevertheless, we can but go and assess the situation for ourselves, and see what can be done."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Lest you doubt what good we few can accomplish, I would remind you that my grandfather and his twelve disciples once journeyed to these lands to save Eorzea and her people from certain doom. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">And you know only too well how that tale ended─albeit at great cost.</span><span class=\"alternative\">Brave souls with an impossible task.
