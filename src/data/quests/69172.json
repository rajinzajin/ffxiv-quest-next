I'm glad they were able to find you."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I'm told you went ahead to scout out the volcano. I don't suppose some grappling hooks will suffice?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"A-All that grinding and shaking... I-I was afraid the lift floor would fall out from underneath me..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"B-But don't worry! I-I'm sure the trembling will go away s-soon!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Thus are we all gathered...though Ryne, I am afeared, did not much enjoy the ascent."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Forgive us our delay. The Exarch arrived and we took some time to apprise him of our mission."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"...Concerned for my health, are you? Indeed, we are a little far from the Crystarium, but rest assured this old man can muster up another wind for what is to come."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Oh, don't mind us. We're just taking in the sights."},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"Ahhh, such an exhilarating ride! And such a magnificent view! Nothing in Eulmore compares to this!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Shall we see how we might be of service?"},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"When he asked for my hand, my husband promised that he would one day build a Talos that could take us to the very heavens. And now he'll do it!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Have the design ready, she says! In good time, she says! Does she even understand what's involved!?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Before I can even attempt to design anything, I need intimate knowledge of the land─the knowledge of locals. Last I heard, no one lives here!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"What? A village of Eulmoran exiles!?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"B-But...those people have every reason to loathe a free citizen like me! They couldn't possibly be willing to cooperate!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"&lt;sob&gt; This will never work. <span class=\"emphasis\">Never</span>. I never should've fixed that ruddy lift. Never should've ridden it up here... Never should've...never should've..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I can't do it... It's impossible..."},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"Oh dear, darling appears to have lost the plot..."},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"But he has it in him, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. He's the cleverest man I know─he just wants for confidence sometimes. If you were to give him some words of encouragement, I'm sure he can give you your Talos."},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"A bit of advice I learned from his mother: he responds poorly to obvious praise. You'll need to find another way to stoke the fires of his motivation─awaken his sense of daring!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Choose words that will best encourage Chai-Nuzz."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In order to succeed, you must lift his spirits sufficiently during the conversation."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Encourage Chai-Nuzz!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Chai-Nuzz is burning with motivation!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Chai-Nuzz is feeling somewhat optimistic."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Chai-Nuzz still harbors some misgivings."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Chai-Nuzz is plagued with self-doubt."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Chai-Nuzz has given up completely."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I can't do it. No one can. A Talos of that size...no one's even dreamed of it."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Alphinaud once struggled to collect firewood."},{"name":"A1","text":"Dulia is counting on you as well."},{"name":"A1","text":"You're a genius! You can do this!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"He did? But...he's such a capable lad, brimming with confidence."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Hmmm... I suppose even the most capable among us have struggles to overcome..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But regardless of my own feelings, I can't do a damn thing without help from those villagers...and they're not bally likely to give it!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I know, I know! You hardly need to tell me that! Do you think I'd disappoint her if I could help it!?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But regardless of my own feelings, I can't do a damn thing without help from those villagers...and they're not bally likely to give it!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Oh, it's simple as that, is it? You say some magic words and I can suddenly do the impossible? Don't make me laugh!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"As I said, I can't do a damn thing without help from those villagers...and they're not bally likely to give it!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Tristol's among them, you said so yourself! Lest you've forgotten, we essentially sent him to his death! Even if the others don't bear a personal grudge, <span class=\"emphasis\">he</span> would never forgive us!"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"You don't know until you apologize. I'll come with you."},{"name":"A2","text":"Don't worry! He'll forgive you for sure!"},{"name":"A2","text":"Things won't improve by themselves. You have to take the first step."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Hmmm... If you were there too, perhaps he'd be more willing to accept an apology..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"W-Wait... What am I thinking, relying on others to fight my battles? It's disgraceful, is what it is, and it might even make things worse..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"And in the end, it's not even a question of forgiveness. Building such an enormous Talos is impossible, and no amount of contrition will change that!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"How can you make such blithe claims without proof? You're either naive or you think I am─and I most certainly am not!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"And whatever you say, in the end it's not even a question of forgiveness. Building such an enormous Talos is impossible, and no amount of contrition will change that!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I know, I know... Unless we take the first step, there can never be reconciliation."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"This is a chance for everyone to come together. Even if they hurled stones at me, perhaps it's worth trying to apologize..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But what then? In the end, it's not even a question of forgiveness. Building such an enormous Talos is impossible, and no amount of contrition will change that."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"And even if by some miracle the people of Amity were willing to let bygones be bygones, they'd think that the plan is absurd! <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> think it's absurd!"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"It's less absurd than the change that's come to Eulmore."},{"name":"A3","text":"We liberated a castle with a strategy that many would call absurd."},{"name":"A3","text":"Everything you touch turns to gold! No one would doubt your plan!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Well, I can't argue with that logic... Enormous as the task is, it's simply a matter of finding a solution to a practical problem. From that perspective, it's not entirely unrealistic."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But realistic or no, there's no guarantee of success. There are risks to consider should the venture fail."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Well now, to flood the very castle you sought to reclaim... Such a strategy could indeed be considered absurd. Yet you succeeded not in spite of, but because of it."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Our own strategy may likewise seem absurd, but maybe─just maybe it stands a better chance of success for it..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But be that as it may, there are risks to consider should the venture fail."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I've no idea where that absolute confidence of yours comes from, but it only makes me feel more wary!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"And even assuming there's a semblance of realism to the plan, have you considered the risks should the venture fail?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Aye, imagine for a moment that we fail to reach Vauthry and only succeed in provoking him. In his fury, he may well unleash his hordes of eaters and we'll meet a horrible end!"},{"name":"Q4","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A4","text":"Then we'll go together!"},{"name":"A4","text":"I'll protect you. I'll protect everyone."},{"name":"A4","text":"We could build Talos for battle."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Oh, so I can die with you!? How very kind of you to offer! But if it's all the same, I'd rather keep on living!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; How can you remain so...so <span class=\"emphasis\">optimistic</span> throughout all this? It's downright tiring..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"&lt;gasp&gt;"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I-I see what you did there. That's how you win over the masses─with that irrepressible aura of dependability."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But very well, you've made your conviction clear...and I'm assured in spite of myself. I won't let my fears get the better of me. It's unseemly if nothing else."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Still, I find it astounding that you can have such certainty given the circumstances."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I've thought of that, I assure you, but I'm afraid Talos cannot contend with sin eaters. If they could, I would never have come to Eulmore."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Nonetheless, I appreciate your earnest attempt to find a solution."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"It makes me wonder, what is it that drives you?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Tell me, why did you throw yourself into the midst of such a grueling struggle?"},{"name":"Q5","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A5","text":"To protect those I love."},{"name":"A5","text":"Because I live for adventure."},{"name":"A5","text":"I got roped into it..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"...!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Indeed... What else could compel us to face such dangers? I too have someone I wish to protect, with whom I want to live out my days in peace..."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Adventure... Such a strange word coming from my lips... I used to have a sense of adventure too. Strove to challenge myself. Whenever did I lose it?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"So you do not fight willingly. Just like me. We may put on a smile, but behind it there's only doubt. If even your heart isn't in it, there's no hope for any of us. No point in building the Talos."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You failed to encourage Chai-Nuzz. Speak with Dulia-Chai to try again."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Yes... Yes! By the gods, I can do this! I just need to have a little faith in myself!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Right, let's head to Amity and speak with the villagers─with Tristol."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"My love, things are liable to become more dangerous. I want you to wait for me back in Eulmore."},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"No. Wherever you go, I'm going too."},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"Besides...you're not the only one who has to apologize."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"B-But there's no telling what may happen out here! I don't know if I can keep you safe!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"P-Perhaps this is a bad idea after all... I-I don't think I have what it takes..."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Master Chai. That you are beset with doubt is proof that you can envision the task ahead."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"And that which man can envision, he can make reality. Thus did some old friends of mine once say."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Even should it be a feat fit for the divine, if something has been done before, then it most assuredly can be done again by our own hands."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"That's a little idealistic, don't you think!?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Perhaps, Master Chai, perhaps. But what is man if not an idealistic creature?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"'Tis not an easy thing to achieve one's dreams─my friends can attest to that. Countless times did they meet with frustration in the course of their endeavors."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"None would have found fault with them had they given up, yet they never did. One step after the next, they forged on towards their goals."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"And for their determination, they accomplished numerous feats that many believed lay beyond the reach of mankind."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Like them, you are a man of science. Amidst your doubts, surely there is a spark of desire. The desire to make the impossible possible."},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"Come, darling. Like the old days, I would be the first to see your Talos."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"And you shall be, my dear. I would have none other at my side when my greatest masterpiece awakens."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Right, then. To Amity."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"I am glad my words struck a chord. Shall we?"},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"Y-You!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"You have every right to be angry with us. But please listen to what I have to say."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I am tasked with delivering these people to Mt. Gulg─by means of a Talos of heretofore unseen proportions."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"However, I cannot do this without the cooperation of those with intimate knowledge of this land. That is, you and your fellow villagers."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"...Cooperation? After you ignored my desperate pleas and cast me out, you have the gall to come here and ask for my cooperation?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"You've every right to be upset. Vauthry's not the one to blame for your suffering─we are."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"We were free citizens without a care in the world, indifferent to the hardship of others. We didn't know what would become of you, and frankly, we didn't care."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But we know now that what we did to you─to full many─was wrong. Terribly wrong. No words will suffice to make amends, but I want you to know that we are deeply sorry."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"I'm not sure how I feel."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"Should I forgive you? Hate you? Perhaps it's not even my place to judge. After all, I sought a place in your city. I wanted to be you, once..."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"But one thing is clear to me."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"All of that is in the past. And we mustn't let past wrongs stand in the way of a brighter future."},{"name":"TRISTOL","text":"And so...I will cooperate with you. Please see our friends to Mt. Gulg."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"You have my word!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"I'll set to work on the design at once. Wouldn't do to have nothing to show the others when they return with help."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Make no mistake, this venture is unprecedented in the history of Talos building─nay, the history of all mankind! But rest assured this genius of Daedalus Stoneworks will deliver!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Ah, wicked white!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Is there a problem?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Well...er, you see... I've been promised people to procure the stone as well as imbue magic."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"When I was put on the spot earlier, I thought that was all we required."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"But I forgot about one rather important item needed to bring a Talos to life..."},{"name":"Q6","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A6","text":"The heart?"},{"name":"A6","text":"What is it?"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"That's right, the heart! I'm pleased to see you have some familiarity with Talos!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"The heart! The godsdamned, bally heart! Without one, a Talos is just a hunk of rock!"},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"So, while I work on the design, I'd be much obliged if you could see to procuring the ore with which to fashion a heart."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"A heart suitable of bringing to life a Talos that shall embrace the very firmament!"}],"reward":{"gil":1000,"items":[{"id":26870}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":78,"id":142}],"quests":[69171]},"next":[69173]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1030216","obj":{"i":1030216,"n":"Alisaie","l":2954,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1027462","obj":{"i":1027462,"n":"Tristol","l":2954,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"26870","obj":{"i":26870,"n":"Dwarven Mythril Chest Gear Coffer (IL 415)","l":1,"c":26559,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"69171","obj":{"i":69171,"n":"In Mt.
