My clever little ray has learned a new trick."},{"name":"MAKURA","text":"You might have seen striped rays with their faces in the sand, looking for food. Normally they just swallow water and filter out the krill, but the tastiest morsels can be found under the seabed."},{"name":"MAKURA","text":"There's a lot more than sediment and ray snacks down there though. This little one has learned how to search for treasure while he's at it! Why don't you take him out there and give it a try?"},{"name":"MAKURA","text":"The ray's been taught to come back here if you get separated. Once you've finished, Zukin will take care of the rest. Good luck!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The ray finds treasure beneath the sediment."},{"name":"MAKURA","text":"I was wondering when you'd be back.

Ride the ray, and use his Inhale ability to search for treasure."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"The ray's belly seems fit to burst. I advise you to stand back when he regurgitates everything. Hopefully there will be some treasure in there along with all the sand and muck."},{"name":"ZUKIN","text":"Makura and her ray toiled for many days and nights to perfect that technique. Their efforts have paid dividends, as we are now able to recover many precious items that would otherwise remain undiscovered."}],"reward":{"gil":615,"reputation":60,"items":[{"num":15,"id":28},{"id":21081}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":4,"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":34}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1024217","obj":{"i":1024217,"n":"Zukin","l":2409,"q":24}},{"type":"npc","id":"1024218","obj":{"i":1024218,"n":"Makura","l":2409,"q":3}},{"type":"item","id":"28","obj":{"i":28,"n":"Allagan Tomestone of Poetics","l":1,"c":65023,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"21081","obj":{"i":21081,"n":"Kojin Sango","l":1,"c":65058,"t":100}}]}
