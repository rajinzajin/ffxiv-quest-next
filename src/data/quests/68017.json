I heard you went shark hunting?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We too did our fair share of beast culling─though I think Lyse made a stronger impression when she bested a drunken pirate in a sparring match. Fastest knockout to date, I am told."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I should like to think we have proven ourselves to be rather─<br>Hm.
