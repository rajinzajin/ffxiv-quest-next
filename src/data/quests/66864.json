To serve them their just deserts, venture to Iron Lake and deliver a good thrashing to two of their rank and file to attract the attention of their overseer, upon whom you may then visit a similar fate.","The overseer has been taught the true meaning of pain, giving the 639th a valuable lesson about getting too big for one's breeches. Return to the 789th Order Dig and assure Bo Zu that the bullies have paid the price for their false pride.","His oppressors having been given their just dues, Bo Zu breathes a sigh of relief and extols your virtues as a capable adventurer. For better or for worse, the dustman will not hesitate to seek your aid the next time he suffers at the hands of his betters..."],"objectives":["Subdue two kobold roundsmen, then defeat the kobold overseer that appears.","Report to 789th Order Dustman Bo Zu."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BOZU","text":"Riddle me, puzzle me, answer me this, adventurer: what is the difference between six-thirty-nine and seven-eighty-nine?
