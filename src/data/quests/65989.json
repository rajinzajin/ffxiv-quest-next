Have you decided to enroll in our guild?

I will be waiting should you choose to embrace a life of academic exertion."},{"name":"MURIE","text":"Your sound judgment is to be commended. Now, standard practice dictates that I introduce you to our guildmaster that you might convey your intentions in person..."},{"name":"MURIE","text":"Due to extraordinary circumstances, however, he is...unreachable at present. Instead, you may speak with Mistress Thubyrgeim. She has shouldered full responsibility for the guild's leadership in the interim."},{"name":"MURIE","text":"You will find her just over there, by the bookshelves. You needn't be shy─though her mind is sharp and critical, her manner is always most welcoming."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Yes, I am Thubyrgeim. Greetings, and welcome to the Arcanists' Guild. As Murie has doubtlessly explained, I am serving as acting guildmaster until our wayward leader deigns to return. I assume our capable receptionist also spoke of our art's origins?"},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"Allow me, then, to expound upon its nature. Arcanima taps into the living energies of aether. The evidence of this is represented most aptly, perhaps, by our ability to manifest the arcane entity Carbuncle, and the manner of magic which this aetherial ally employs at our command."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"The core of the discipline, however, is found in the pursuit of definitive solutions to any potential quandary. Even on the field of battle─nay, <span class=\"emphasis\">especially</span> on the field of battle─this principle takes precedence."},{"name":"THUBYRGEIM","text":"If one wishes to make certain the question of victory, then one must apply the most effective strategy.
