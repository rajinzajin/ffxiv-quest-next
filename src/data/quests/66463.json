To that end, the cook asks you to bring him the meat of a mudpuppy's tail so that he can prepare steaks. He furnishes you with a bottle of cider vinegar, explaining that the locals believe it can be used to weaken the beasts─though Haustefort himself has his doubts. In any case, travel to Daniffen Pass and attempt to use the vinegar to slay a mudpuppy.","Local superstition appears to be accurate, as the ravenous mudpuppy falters mere moments after you sprinkle the cider vinegar upon it. Having slain the beast and severed a solid portion of its tail, return to Haustefort so he can prepare the steaks.","Haustefort demonstrates an unbelievable level of skill by preparing three steaks mere moments after you deliver the meat. Dole out the fresh steaks to the hungry knights of Whitebrim Front.","Every steak met with overwhelming approval. Return to Haustefort and tell him that you have finished your task.","Haustefort has prepared one final steak for Cenota, a young chirurgeon who he suspects is in need of proper nourishment. Deliver it to her in the infirmary.","The odor of freshly cooked meat serves to remind Cenota of her neglected needs. She thanks you profusely and proceeds to devour the steak in moments, much to the chagrin of the disoriented patient who has suddenly found himself forgotten."],"objectives":["Slay a spotted mudpuppy.","Deliver the tail meat to Haustefort.","Offer the steaks to the hungry soldiers.","Speak with Haustefort.","Offer a steak to Cenota."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To accept this quest, you must abandon the current main scenario quest.

Aye, word travels fast in Whitebrim Front.

Win over the barracks, and he's sure to take notice. How, you ask? That's easy─serve the poor souls decent fare for a change."},{"name":"HAUSTEFORT","text":"The last few supply shipments contained no meat whatsoever, and the knights are rightfully beginning to complain. I'm thinking we could prepare them steaks using mudpuppy tail meat. 'Twouldn't be a quality meal, 'tis true, but it'd be a damn sight better than nothing."},{"name":"HAUSTEFORT","text":"If you've a mind to lend a hand, why not await a lurking mudpuppy in Daniffen Pass? And take this bottle of vinegar; locals say it weakens mudpuppies by clogging their mucous glands, drying their skin."},{"name":"HAUSTEFORT","text":"It didn't work, did it? Aye, I thought it was an idiotic idea..."},{"name":"HAUSTEFORT","text":"Oh dear...remind me to never wander near mudpuppy spawning grounds without a bottle of vinegar. Anyroad, this should only take a moment. I'll just need to do this...and this...and voilà! Never seen a man cook steaks that fast, have you?

Amazing what good food can do for morale, eh?"},{"name":"HAUSTEFORT","text":"Ah, but I've forgotten about the hardworking chirurgeons at the infirmary─so rarely do they take their meals here in the hall.
