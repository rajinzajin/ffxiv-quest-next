He has sent the tender lamb on ahead, with word that a sheep-crowned comrade is to follow. Don your hitsuji kabuto, and rendezvous with the golden hitsuji yoriki in Gridania.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","The golden hitsuji yoriki welcomes you to the fold, and briefs you on the current situation: a traveling trader en route to Gridania has been waylaid in Bentbranch Meadows, her chocobo laid low by a mystery affliction. It refuses to move, or eat, or─more importantly─sleep. A sad situation, but an unmissable opportunity to showcase the tender lamb's talents. Take her to Bentbranch Meadows, and talk with the troubled trader.","The skeptical merchant grudgingly accepts your offer to calm her restless chocobo, but before you can blast the bird, the tender lamb is distracted by a certain something outside the ranch gates. Could your flossy friend have espied some clue to the causes of the chocobo's distress?","You discover a chocobo tailfeather pressed into the ground on the southbound road. It seems it was this that caught the tender lamb's attention. Return to the trader, and see if it bears any special significance.","The merchant is unimpressed by your find, but it deeply affects her chocobo. The bird gazes longingly at the feather, and seems somehow soothed. Her astonished owner urges you to take advantage of this moment of calm to activate the lamb's magic. Let out a /cheer for the chocobo to trigger your companion's hypnoturgical blast.","The soporific spell lays the agitated bird to rest. But what of the strange feather? Keitha, head wrangler at Bentbranch Meadows and chocobo expert extraordinaire, may be able to make something of it.","Keitha identifies the feather as belonging to a chocobo recently sold to a wealthy visitor. The chocobo in question was an old clutchmate of the trader's bird─perhaps it was the thwarting of their reunion that plunged her into depression. With your lamb in tow, return to the trader and relate Keitha's supposition.","The traveling trader can well see the truth in Keitha's story, and vows to do what it takes to cheer her heartsore bird. Instead of pushing on to Gridania, they will follow the rich man's trail to the south, that the long-awaited reunion may come to pass. Return to the golden hitsuji yoriki, and report on the outcome of your mission.","The golden hitsuji yoriki lauds your efforts as a great success. He presents you with a kabuto of his own design, to bear testimony to your service to the Fleece Force in Gridania. Repeat the feat in the other city states, and the triumph of the bugyo's plan is all but assured."],"objectives":["While wearing the hitsuji kabuto, speak with the golden hitsuji yoriki in Gridania.","With the tender lamb minion summoned, speak with the traveling trader in Bentbranch Meadows.","With the tender lamb minion summoned, search for the object of interest outside the gates.","With the tender lamb minion summoned, show the chocobo tailfeather to the traveling trader.","With the tender lamb minion summoned, /cheer for the pack chocobo.","With the tender lamb minion summoned, speak with Keitha.","With the tender lamb minion summoned, report to the traveling trader.","Report to the golden hitsuji yoriki."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SHEEPMISSIONARY","text":"Our plans are in motion, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">my lady</span><span class=\"alternative\">my lord</span></span>.

S'posed to be heading to Gridania, but me chocobo's in a right funk. The breeders 'round here can't make beak nor brush of it. Well...there was that one feller─seemed to think a magical sheep'd sort her out. Wonder what the chocobokeeps'd make of him..."},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"What a lovely little lamb ye've got there...

Maybe a bit to the left... No, the other left... Ah, it's no use. That lamb of yers was the one that spotted it, whatever it is. Where'd she go, anyway?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You find the tailfeather of a chocobo pressed into the ground."},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"What happened to yer sheep? Bring her back, will ye? Betsy seemed a little more relaxed with her around."},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"So, did ye find anything? If it'll help calm Betsy down, I'll take it!"},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"What's this...? A chocobo feather? Oh, yes, very well done─ye've found a chocobo feather just outside a chocobo ranch. I'm sure this must be a clue of the utmost impor─ ...Huh?"},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"Why're ye so interested in this feather, Betsy? She looks so sad...and yet somehow, soothed... <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Lady</span><span class=\"alternative\">Sir</span></span>, if ye ain't lying about yer sheep, then please, use yer magic now.

Ranchers say they've seen a lamb on the loose inside the meadow gates. If a scurryin' furball like that gets into the stables, the birds'll go mad!"},{"name":"KEITHA","text":"Eh? You think that chocobo's problems've got something to do with a feather? Give us a look at it. Hmmm... Looks like it's from the bird I sold to that scattergood who paid us a visit the other day. Wanted to buy the whole ranch, he did─we talked him down to just one chocobo."},{"name":"KEITHA","text":"Ahhh, so that's what this is about! That chocobo was an old clutchmate of the merchant's bird. We asked the feller to wait a few days so they could have their little reunion, but he had some business to the south that couldn't keep, and he wouldn't take no for an answer."},{"name":"KEITHA","text":"The poor bird must've smelled her mate's scent by the gates, and then not bein' able to find him... Perhaps she thought the worst had happened. Chocobos form bonds like us, but I've never seen a bond this strong. Nay, not in all my years workin' with the creatures."},{"name":"KEITHA","text":"I never realized she'd take it so hard... Pass along my apologies to the trader, will ye? We tried our best to keep hold of her bird's friend, but the fact is we can't run the place without coin."},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"Did ye find anything out about the chocobo feather? But wait...ye've lost yer lamb! I couldn't live with meself if anything happened to her, after all she's done for Betsy. Please, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">dear</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, will ye find her and make sure she's safe?"},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"Did Keitha tell ye anything? ...Ah, I see. Aye, I know the chocobo she means. S'pose ye could say him and Betsy were chick-hood sweethearts. Betsy was born and raised here in Bentbranch Meadows─she must've been looking forward to stopping here ever since we set out from Thanalan."},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"But when she got here, her friend was gone, eh? Small wonder she was all shook up. ...Alright, girl, we're turning back. The markets can wait─when Betsy wakes up, we're going after that bird!"},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"Keitha said they've only been gone a day or so, right? I'm sure we'll be able to catch them if we put our minds to it. I might lose out on a bit of coin, but if it brings the twinkle back to Betsy's eyes, it'll be worth it."},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"Thank ye, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">dear</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, for everything. Without yer help, me darling Betsy might've wasted away before me eyes. Oh...and will ye thank that friend of yers for me, too? Tell him I'm sorry for calling him a madman, and saying his hat was stupid."},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"But most of all, I thank that little lamb of yers. She's a keen-eyed little bugger, and that magic...well, I've never seen anything quite like it. You and her make a great team."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The tender lamb looks at you with pride."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"By working together to soothe the restive chocobo, you and the tender lamb have grown a little closer."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Your joint effort to ease another troubled soul has brought you and the tender lamb even closer together."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"With a third successful mollification, you and the tender lamb have become fast friends."},{"name":"BREEDER","text":"I never thought that little lamb of yers'd ever be able to calm Betsy down, the state she was in. Thank ye, me dears. And thank that friend of yers in the woolly hat for me too, will ye?"},{"name":"GOLDENSHEEPYORIKI","text":"What ho, my stalwart ally! How fare you in your quest? Is the Twelveswood abuzz with word of the Fleece Force?"},{"name":"GOLDENSHEEPYORIKI","text":"What ho, my stalwart ally! Your tender lamb returned to me not a moment ago, wagging her tail behind her. Does this mean you have completed your quest? Is the Twelveswood abuzz with word of the Fleece Force?"},{"name":"GOLDENSHEEPYORIKI","text":"I see... So the hypnoturgical blast <span class=\"emphasis\">does</span> work against chocobos. A welcome development indeed! I shall be sure to underline that fact in my report."},{"name":"GOLDENSHEEPYORIKI","text":"Although it is unfortunate that the trader will not be calling on Gridania. The combination of a loud-mouthed merchant and a busy marketplace seemed the perfect grist for the rumor mill."},{"name":"GOLDENSHEEPYORIKI","text":"But no matter. The trader was impressed, was she not? No doubt she will sing of sheep to all and sundry along her travels. Mayhap we shall even find a benefactor in this affluent fellow she plans to trail. As such, I judge your mission a roaring success!"},{"name":"GOLDENSHEEPYORIKI","text":"Please allow me to present you with a replica of my own helm, a snow white hitsuji kabuto, as a token of my appreciation. By this, the bugyo will know that you have done great deeds this day."},{"name":"GOLDENSHEEPYORIKI","text":"Heavens forfend it, but if by some unhappy twist of fate the kabuto should become lost or damaged, rest assured the hitsuji shonin will know you for a friend, and permit you to purchase a replacement. When you have all three helms, report to the bugyo─I am sure he will reward you for your efforts."},{"name":"GOLDENSHEEPYORIKI","text":"Well then, all that remains for me is to return the prototype lamb to my master. You have proved yourself a true ally to our cause this day, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">m'lady</span><span class=\"alternative\">m'lord</span></span>.
