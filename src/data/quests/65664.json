Terribly unfortunate business, that."},{"name":"MONRANGUIN","text":"It seems, however, that you had little trouble gathering the egg sacs in their stead. Excellent work. I shall have them sent over to the Trappers' League immediately."},{"name":"MONRANGUIN","text":"Lest you wonder, these egg sacs are not destined for the dinner table!

Until relatively recently, any Hyur who contracted this ghastly illness would almost invariably perish."},{"name":"MONRANGUIN","text":"Indeed, a single outbreak once claimed the lives of a third of the Hyuran population here in Gridania. That was a long time ago, of course. With the medicines available to us now, the Creeping Death is not the killer it once was."},{"name":"MONRANGUIN","text":"Even so, it is best to halt any new outbreaks before they occur. Thus we gather chigoe eggs on a regular basis in order to assist the Trappers' League with their ongoing research. Your timely assistance is most appreciated."}],"reward":{"xp":2240},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":4,"id":130}],"quests":[65732]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000449","obj":{"i":1000449,"n":"Monranguin","l":54,"q":4}},{"type":"quest","id":"65732","obj":{"i":65732,"n":"An Eft for Effort","g":0,"l":"Central Shroud","s":21}}]}
