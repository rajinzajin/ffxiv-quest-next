However, there are a number of preparations which must be seen to before you can make formal arrangements. First, you must speak with the ceremony outfitter and collect your complimentary garments.<br><br>※This objective may be completed without your partner.","After furnishing you with your garments, the ceremony outfitter advises you to return to Claribel─though not before encouraging you to /embrace your beloved during the ceremony. Speak with the ceremony planner to continue with your preparations.<br><br>※This objective may be completed without your partner.","In accordance with tradition, you and your partner must prepare symbols of your undying devotion─the blessed rings you will exchange during the ceremony.

Return to the Sanctum of the Twelve and present the ring to Claribel for her inspection.<br><br>※This objective may be completed without your partner.","Claribel regales you with an ancient tale of two souls who wandered Eorzea in search of answers from the Twelve, from which the next tradition you and your partner must observe originates. To wit, you and your partner must embark upon a pilgrimage to the marks of the Twelve, where together you must /pray to receive Their blessings. Begin by retracing the steps of the original pilgrims and /pray at the marks of the Matron, the Builder, and the Keeper in the Twelveswood.<br><br>※To complete this objective, you and your partner must have completed all previous objectives. Moreover, you must form a party of two with your partner, you must both equip yourselves with promise wristlets, and your partner must be present when you /pray.","You visit all three marks in the Twelveswood, praying to each as instructed by Claribel.

Moreover, you must form a party of two with your partner, you must both equip yourselves with promise wristlets, and your partner must be present when you /pray.","Having completed the La Noscean leg of your pilgrimage, journey to Thanalan and /pray at the marks of the Dusk Trader, the Destroyer, and the Warden.<br><br>※To complete this objective, you and your partner must have completed all previous objectives. Moreover, you must form a party of two with your partner, you must both equip yourselves with promise wristlets, and your partner must be present when you /pray.","Only three more marks remain.

Moreover, you must form a party of two with your partner, you must both equip yourselves with promise wristlets, and your partner must be present when you /pray.","Far though you have come, your pilgrimage is not yet finished.
