So urgently does he seek a scout that he will hire one himself.","A veteran of many skirmishes with the Ixal, Belmont suspects that there is more to the beastmen's presence in this part of the world than meets the eye. He bids you use your stealth and cunning to search their lair to the east.","After a review of the Ixal's housekeeping and a battle to the death, you discover nothing more unusual than a pile of yew logs. Still, they grew not from these woods, and the birdmen hardly kept them as pets. Return to the camp and give one of the logs to Belmont.","According to Belmont, the yew you brought back is found only in the Twelveswood and is much favored by the Ixal, who plant the tree to create living fortifications. Belmont believes that this is evidence that the Ixal are settling in Coerthas, seizing on the distraction afforded by Ishgard's many troubles."],"objectives":["Search the Ixali lair for clues.","Deliver the black yew log to Belmont."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BELMONT","text":"I hail from Gridania, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sister</span><span class=\"alternative\">brother</span></span> from the sea</span><span class=\"alternative\">same as you</span><span class=\"alternative\">desert <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sister</span><span class=\"alternative\">brother</span></span></span></span>.
