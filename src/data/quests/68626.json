Yet he also knows that if anyone could, it would be his friend and rival (but mostly rival) Byrglaent.","One would hope Byrglaent's vintages contain less pith than his reply to your request for a bottle of Suhd Viandja. But at least the vitriolic vintner was kind enough to point you in the direction of one who might take pity on your plight─prodigal plutocrat Gegeruju of Costa del Sol.","But of course Master Gegeruju has a bottle of vintage Suhd Viandja, and of course he will not part with it...unless, that is, you bring him a bottle of Dalmascan wine in exchange. As for where to find a wine so rare, only a blind Lalafellin vintner might know. Fortunately, you know just the man.","Against his own better judgment, Shamani Lohmani suggests that you speak with a veteran of the Dalmascan conflict, Drest, to see if he might have a bottle of his homeland's finest.","Drest is handling the trauma of witnessing his home nation being reduced to rubble about as well as one might expect. A soothing gesture might help to quiet his demons.","Drest is handling your soothing gesture about as well as one who witnessed his home nation reduced to rubble might. Will a comforting gesture work any better? There is only one way to find out.","Sufficiently comforted by your words, Drest is blessed with a rare moment of spiritual solace in which he recalls a heartfelt memory of his wife and her queer habit of collecting the corks of empty wine bottles─bottles not unlike the one he once discarded in a midden heap under the Severed String.","You discover an empty, yet corked, bottle of wine that could be Dalmascan. The blind vintner of Wineport should know more.","Thanks in part to the faint scent still lingering on the cork, Shamani Lohmani is able to confirm beyond doubt that Drest's empty bottle did indeed contain Dalmascan wine. Sadly, however, the vintner believes that Gegeruju is unlikely to accept a lingering scent in exchange for the Suhd Viandja. Luckily, Shamani Lohmani is, for once, not the only other soul in the winery, as Hancock of the East Aldenard Trading Company just happens to be visiting Eorzea on business. Having eavesdropped on your conversation, he proceeds to offer up a most wicked solution: fill the empty bottle with a Hingan red and pass it off as a genuine Lea Monde Valens. He even provides you with a bottle of the suggested substitute, free of charge. Though Shamani Lohmani vehemently disapproves, he quite literally turns a blind eye to your brazen act of counterfeiture. All that remains is to make the exchange.","Hancock's scheme is a success. Oblivious to the bottle's true content, Gegeruju keeps his end of the bargain and presents you with a bottle of vintage Suhd Viandja rosé.","Upon delivering the finely fermented fruits of your labor to the wandering dramaturge, he tells you it is, in fact, a gift for his wife─none other than the company belle─to celebrate the day the two first met.","Satisfied with your effort, the dramaturge offers you both his thanks and a little something for your trouble."],"objectives":["Speak with Shamani Lohmani in Wineport.","Speak with Byrglaent.","Speak with Gegeruju in Costa del Sol.","Speak with Shamani Lohmani.","Speak with Drest.","/soothe the shaken Drest.","/comfort the crestfallen Drest.","Search nearby for an empty wine bottle.","Take the empty wine bottle to Shamani Lohmani.","Deliver the bottle of “Dalmascan” wine to Gegeruju.","Deliver the bottle of Suhd Viandja to the wandering dramaturge on the <span class=\"emphasis\">Prima Vista</span>.","Speak with the wandering dramaturge."],"dialogue":[{"name":"RAMZALEXENTALE","text":"Tell me, is Ridorana truly as magnificent as they say? ...Hm?

Only an uncultured fool would select a wine based solely on its bottle!"},{"name":"BYRGLAENT","text":"As it happens, however, said fool would be undeservingly rewarded with one of Vylbrand's best wines were he to select a vintage Suhd Viandja.

In all likelihood, Master Gegeruju will never even open the bottle, rendering the provenance of its contents practically irrelevant."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Ah, but where are my manners? These forays back to western climes always bring out the barbarian in me. It is a pleasure, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Lest you wonder at my presence here, my employers see promise in the Hingan wine trade, and desire the establishment of a viable route 'twixt east and west. I am come to see their plan to fruition."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"But returning to your dilemma, I believe that I may be of assistance. I just so happen to have on my person several sample bottles of Hingan wine made with grapes similar to those once found in Dalmasca.

As a maker of wine, I cannot allow it!"},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"Master Gegeruju has cozened more of his clients than he can count. How do you think the man amassed his fortune? By playing fair? Would that the world were thus. But I am here to tell you it is not."},{"name":"HANCOCK","text":"So! It is decided then. We shall employ deceit as our morally justified means to a happy end."},{"name":"SHAMANILOHMANI","text":"W-Wait!
