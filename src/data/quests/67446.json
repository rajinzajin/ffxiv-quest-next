Find out where he could be by asking the Vanu of Ok' Zundu for his whereabouts.","You have asked about Gunu Vanu's whereabouts and it seems that he enjoys lazing about and shirking responsibility more than the average Vanu Vanu. He spends most of his time napping under a shade or in a warm sunbeam. Once you find him, with the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase that includes the words “Wake up!” to rouse Gunu Vanu.","Gunu Vanu wakes up in a panic─it was as entertaining as promised.
