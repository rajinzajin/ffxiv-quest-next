{"quest":{"name":"Honorable Heroes","location":"Southern Thanalan","id":67884,"patch":3.4,"sort":8,"eventIcon":71201,"issuer":1017759,"target":1017762,"involved":[1006224,1017755,1017757,1017758,1017760,1017761],"genre":5,"usedItems":[2995,3306],"journal":["Papalymo has a mind to learn the Griffin's true intentions.","Papalymo surmises that the Ala Mhigan posing as the Griffin may well be one of Resistance leader's closest associates, and party to his master's overarching plan. Like the Griffin himself, however, the man is wary of strangers, and will need to be lured out if you are to question him. That being the case, Papalymo would have you and Alphinaud pose as adventurers fallen on hard times who have been inspired by his words to take up arms for the Resistance. While he and Yda convince the masked impostor of your worthiness, you and Alphinaud are to purchase suitably filthy garments from a refugee named Talebot using the funds Papalymo has provided.","Talebot is more than happy to supply you with worn-out, dirt-stained garments in exchange for nothing more than a sack of gil and a promise to tell him nothing of your intentions. Having agreed to the man's terms, Alphinaud regards his new used tunic and slops with a mixture of excitement and horror.","Having obtained your disguises, you need only change and wait with Alphinaud outside Little Ala Mhigo until the false Griffin arrives. Of course, this may prove difficult should you somehow misplace the weathered tunic and slops...but considering the rather large sum you paid Talebot, he should have little reason to deny you another set.","Yda and Papalymo arrive at the appointed hour, along with the masked impostor and a single bodyguard. Swiftly dispensing with any attempt at subterfuge, Alphinaud accuses the Griffin and his Masks of conspiring to summon a primal. At once, the man identifies you all as members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, and rather admirably proceeds to refute your accusations, calmly explaining that the crystals were traded with the Amalj'aa in exchange for their aid in battle against the Garleans. When Yda scolds him for striking such a shortsighted bargain, however, he explodes in anger, declaring that the Griffin and his loyal Masks will do whatever it takes to win Ala Mhigo's freedom. Regaining his composure, he invites you to search his camp for the crystals if you doubt his word, and Papalymo accepts. But before the revolutionary takes his leave, he spares a moment to thank you for a kindness performed long ago by which he was saved, and for being a symbol of hope to the hopeless far and wide. “We shall not squander your gift,” he says, leaving you to wonder what responsibility you bear for the actions of those whose lives you have touched.","The repercussions of our actions can never be predicted in their entirety. In saving a life, do we doom a hundred more? And, if so, would the correct choice be not to intervene? Alphinaud has no patience for such questions of cosmic justice or morality this day, and would rather concentrate on the problems at hand─as you so often do. “This is no time for looking back,” he says, and a part of you agrees─and yet..."],"objectives":["Deliver the sack of gil to Talebot.","Speak with Alphinaud.","While wearing the weathered shepherd's tunic and slops, speak with Alphinaud.","Speak with Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"YDA","text":"Do you honestly think he's planning to liberate Ala Mhigo with the help of a primal? I mean, could he really be that stupid!?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"In retrospect, their tale is not so surprising. We had reason to believe that they had escaped with the aid of Ala Mhigan refugees, after all. Still, Tataru will be delighted to hear we have been reunited─once we have attended to matters here, of course."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...He hired a chocobo porter, didn't he? By the Twelve, was the aetheryte not to his liking? &lt;sigh&gt;"},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"If, as you suspect, the Griffin is indeed plotting to summon a primal, we must needs obtain confirmation while there is yet time to act. To that end, I propose we question his double."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"Given his role as the group's de facto mouthpiece, I should not be surprised if he were one of the Griffin's closest associates. And while he may not be aware of the most sensitive details, he can probably tell us the Masks' plans in broad strokes."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"Like the man whom he impersonates, however, he is wary of outsiders. He will not expose himself without a suitable incentive."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"My plan is as follows: you and Alphinaud will pose as adventurers fallen on hard times, inspired by his words to take up arms for a noble cause."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"Yda and I, as members of the Resistance, will recount tales of your past achievements, and testify as to your usefulness in the struggles ahead. With our enthusiastic assurances still ringing in his ears, he will decide to welcome you in person, and we will arrange a meeting."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"You will need to look the part that we might maintain the charade─until we have him cornered, at least. Here─this should be enough to purchase suitable garments from Talebot, and to have him rub a respectable amount of dirt on them for good measure. Any questions?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It all seems simple enough, thank you. And with that, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, let us be off!"},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"Talebot has an assortment of affordable clothing which he sells to the refugees. The sum in that sack should more than suffice, but if it and my name are not enough to secure his cooperation, pay him double. I shall see that you are recompensed."},{"name":"YDA","text":"Our identities will be revealed, but it can't be helped. We don't have time for a cleverer approach."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well, don't look at me. You are the one with the sack of gil.<br>...You do have the sack of gil, don't you?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Oh, don't mind me. Just waiting for our fashionably late bard... You seem rather busy, so I won't keep you."},{"name":"TALEBOT","text":"Eh? You want to buy <span class=\"emphasis\">what</span>? I don't know what you're up to, but I want no part of it."},{"name":"TALEBOT","text":"Well, you're the ones with the gil, and seein' as you're friends of Papalymo..."},{"name":"TALEBOT","text":"There.

I will go and change, and see you at the spot Papalymo marked on our maps."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Why are you not wearing the clothes Talebot gave you? They could be here at any moment!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If by some curious and inexplicable twist of fate you have mislaid them, go back to him and request another set. But for the love of the Twelve, do it <span class=\"emphasis\">quickly</span>!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well, look at us─a pair of down-at-heel adventurers seeking a chance to recapture past glories. Yes, this should suffice."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And now we play the waiting game..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Quarrymill, he said? Do you remember...?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Forgive me. You cannot be expected to recall every name and face, and besides, it's not as if it matters."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I have long admired how you live in the present.
