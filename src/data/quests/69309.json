Together you hasten to Spagyrics, where your comrade is currently being tended to.","To your relief, you arrive in Spagyrics to find Thancred up and talking. He reveals that he has not been in the best of health since plucking Urianger from a watery grave, suffering regular bouts of dizziness prior to his recent mishap. In the absence of any obvious physical cause, it seems certain that the link between his body and soul has weakened further. With time growing short, the Exarch bids you make a trip to the Source to consult Krile regarding the plan to return everyone home. Thus do you set out for the Rising Stones, where your friends' unmoving bodies still lie.","Though plainly pleased to see you, Tataru cannot conceal her unease. Your slumbering friends, she reveals, have taken a turn for the worse. Upon learning of your purpose, she suggests you go straight to Krile, who is tending to everyone in Dawn's Respite.","You step into the dimly lit chamber, and are met with the unsettling sight of your friends locked in slumber. In somber tones, Krile admits that they now betray scant signs of life. Thanks to her ministrations, however, their condition remains stable for the present, and so she suggests that you continue your conversation outside.","Back in the Rising Stones' main hall, you apprise Krile of the situation in the First, and she concurs that Thancred's symptoms indicate a further weakening of the link between body and soul. Though she has thus far been able to quell the fluctuations in your comrades' aether, there is no telling when that may change, and she stresses that their souls' return cannot come soon enough. Upon learning that you seek to draw upon Allagan wisdom in developing the spirit vessel, she offers to solicit the aid of an individual who is an expert in the field."],"objectives":["Speak with Thancred.","Speak with Tataru at the Rising Stones.","Enter Dawn's Respite.","Speak with Krile."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"The rest of our conversation must wait.

It cannot have been easy leaving Thancred's side. My thanks for bearing word to us."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Come, let us hurry to Spagyrics."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I fear this bodes ill...and not just for Thancred."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Ryne found you, then. We had to send the children off earlier than planned, but they understood."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Thancred! Shouldn't you be resting!?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"It appears our friend has already awakened. For that, at least, we can be thankful..."},{"name":"CHESSAMILE","text":"The infirmary is at your disposal. If there is anything you need, don't hesitate to let us know."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"They dragged you here too, did they? My apologies..."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"How do you feel?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Embarrassed. But otherwise well enough. I won't be staying overnight."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"This episode was not the result of any injury I could find. Thancred's aether, however, did show signs of instability, and I did what I could to calm the fluctuations."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Hm. And all of this happened without warning...?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Not exactly."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"You will doubtless recall the time Urianger nearly drowned and I gallantly went to his rescue."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"When his water-walking charm failed. He was tired. As were <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> when you got back."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"We were both spent, yes. On account of which, you begged us to rest─which, in retrospect, may have been a good idea."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"The fact is, I've been experiencing regular bouts of light-headedness ever since. But there was no actual fainting until now."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"As Alphinaud observed, I have no lingering injuries, and it most assuredly <span class=\"emphasis\">isn't</span> old age. Which leaves but one likely cause..."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"The link between body and soul has weakened further."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Time grows short. We must complete the spirit vessel with all haste."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"To that end, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, might I trouble you to make a trip to the Source?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"In addition to looking in on our friends' bodies, I would have you consult Krile about our plan. If she has any concerns, we should at least endeavor to address them prior to proceeding."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"In the meantime, <span class=\"emphasis\">we</span> should get back to laying bare Elidibus's plot."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Thus far, I have learned this much: that in each of the places he has visited, there have been sightings of suspicious black-clad strangers."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Moreover, the coming of these shady individuals has invariably coincided with some manner of misfortune─beasts terrorizing settlements, blight ravaging crops, you know the sort of thing."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"All of which serves, rather conveniently, to make Elidibus's call for new heroes reverberate that much more loudly in the hearts of his audience."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And you think these black-clad strangers are Ascians."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I do. And I fully intend to investigate further─though for that I shall require additional feet on the ground."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"You can count on mine. Gods know I've been itching to get out there for a while."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Mayhap Urianger too can be prevailed upon to join in your efforts."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"He has already provided copious guidance on the matter of the spirit vessel's construction. It is for Beq Lugg and I to wrestle with the rest."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Well, if you can spare the old boy, we may as well make use of him. I'll go and give him the good news."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"You'll do no such thing. However heedless you are of your own well-being, if you care at all for Ryne's feelings, you'll stay in bed until you're needed.

I call myself a receptionist, and I haven't even bothered to ask you why you're here!"},{"name":"TATARU","text":"So, they think the spirit vessel will be ready soon?

A-And they will!"},{"name":"KRILE","text":"What news from the First?"},{"name":"KRILE","text":"I see. Work on the spirit vessel proceeds apace, but our friends begin to falter..."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"As they themselves have observed, the link between body and soul has weakened. It's as simple as that."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"For now, I'm still able to quell the fluctuations in their aether, but it's only a matter of time."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"We'll lose them if we don't act soon. So if the Exarch is ready to attempt something, let him attempt it."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"As for the spirit vessel itself..."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"If we seek to draw upon Allagan wisdom, we could do worse than consult an expert in the field."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"And I think I know just the man.
