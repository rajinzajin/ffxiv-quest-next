I must reach out to my friends in each nation and find out all I can."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Ahhh...!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, I suppose I do feel better on a full stomach, after all. Burning skies? Blasphemies? Not if I've got anything to say about it!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Should Ryne ask questions, don't hide the truth from her. If anything, see if she has any insights to offer."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"She's not a child in need of protection, but a comrade we should be willing to rely upon. Even if a part of me may always beg to differ."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"If the Forum truly has been spurred to action by Hydaelyn's prophecy, then is it not odd that the Antitower was entrusted to Master Matoya, who bears them no love?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"No doubt She has a reason for this, and I would know what it is..."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"Beasts and blasphemies may be running amok in nearby lands outside the influence of Radz–at–Han and the alliance. If so, I may need to go hunting."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Take this, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─my spirit vessel."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Empty now, of course, but it should allow you to operate the tower's systems in the Umbilicus."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"If even the smallest fragment of Elidibus's essence remains, it should be possible to locate it."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"As for access to the Umbilicus, pray seek out Lyna for assistance. Chances are she still stands watch at the Accensor Gate."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Should she or anyone else ask after me, tell them...I am living my life to the fullest. That I am happy, hardships and all."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"...Well, we had best be on our respective ways. Gods willing, we will see each other again ere long."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! You are returned!"},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Have you been well? You and the others..."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"As well as can be."},{"name":"A1","text":"We've no shortage of troubles, but we're well enough."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Full glad am I to hear that. I trust my lord is enjoying himself."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Then things are much the same for you as they were here. My lord is doubtless enjoying himself."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"He...he said this to you? These exact words?"},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Oh, to know that he is happy... It fills my heart with joy."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. For taking care of him."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"When next you see him, please tell him not to overexert himself. Futile a request though it is."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"And tell him that all is well here."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"The peace you gifted us continues, and we work hard to build new lives for ourselves."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"In the course of this we occasionally bicker, but we've never been more optimistic for the morrow."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"If I had to mention one dilemma, it would be the question of our governance. Even as we speak, debate rages on over how we should run the city in the Exarch's absence."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Most are of a mind that the Settlement council should continue to oversee the general running of the Crystarium, while representatives are elected to determine policy and handle diplomacy."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Thus far nothing is set in stone, but however we choose to proceed, we will not replace our lord. No one could."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"...Have we recently observed any unusual phenomena?"},{"name":"LYNA","text":"No, I cannot say there have been. Curious that you should ask me this question, though..."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Some days ago, Ryne came and asked the very same. She was rather unsettled─in stark contrast to how cheerful she has been of late."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"She and other Crystarium youths just hosted a festival, you see."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"It proved so popular that there are already plans for another celebration─one much bigger than the first."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Between her preparations for the festival and the restoration of the Empty, she struck me as happy and full of life."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Ryne has been dedicating herself to the restoration of the Empty, you see."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Though it will take many long years, the goal seems to have given her a newfound sense of purpose and fulfillment."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"So when I saw her in a state of such worry, I couldn't help but feel worried in turn. Especially since she wouldn't tell me what troubled her."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"I daresay she would be more willing to confide in you. May I ask you to broach the subject with her?"},{"name":"LYNA","text":"You wish to enter the Umbilicus? Very well. I shall fetch the key at once─and take the opportunity to find Ryne."},{"name":"LYNA","text":"Please wait for me in the city, in front of the Cabinet of Curiosity, shall we say. I will be along as soon as I can."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The following event cannot be skipped. You may wish to cancel any pending Duty Finder registrations."},{"name":"Q2","text":"Wait for Lyna?"},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"(-???-)...Do my old eyes deceive? Is that truly <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"Hah, it is! Full glad am I to see you hale and whole, my friend!"},{"name":"MOREN","text":"What a wonderful surprise it is to have you back with us─and at this most opportune time!"},{"name":"MOREN","text":"In case you haven't heard, we are planning to produce a tome chronicling events from the Flood to the night's return."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"For this project, we intend to draw upon records kept by the world's peoples."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Historical and contemporary firsthand accounts will be the centerpiece of the tome, but yours would be the one to crown them all!"},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"I've been asked to contribute a chapter on the soul─a subject that is key to understanding much of your endeavors."},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"In the course of developing the spirit vessel, I gained valuable insights into travel beyond the rift. Knowledge that will allow me to attest to your existence and deeds!"},{"name":"MOREN","text":"There is no end to the questions I would ask you, but if you could indulge me just one for now..."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"In your quest to restore the night, you faced many a formidable foe."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Among them, who offered you the greatest struggle?"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Titania, driven mad by Light and loneliness."},{"name":"A3","text":"Vauthry, in his misguided self-righteousness."},{"name":"A3","text":"Hades, who bore the burden of his people."},{"name":"A3","text":"This may come as a surprise, but..."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Ah yes, Titania, the fallen faerie king. Against such a fiendishly playful opponent, I can well imagine that even the Warrior of Darkness must have struggled."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"But you succeeded in setting them free, and your victory proved a pivotal moment in your quest. We will see that it features prominently in the tome!"},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Ah yes, Lord Vauthry, former leader of Eulmore and the final Lightwarden you cast down. Building his paradise on Mt. Gulg, he proclaimed his existence immaculate and took the name Innocence."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Your reckoning with him was, without a doubt, a defining moment in history, and we will see that it features prominently in the tome!"},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Ah yes, Hades, he who sought to resurrect his ancient brethren. He was the final obstacle in your quest to restore the night; your battle in the depths of the Tempest the stuff of epics."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Yet compelling as it is, I worry that mere words wouldn't do justice to that fateful confrontation..."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Not that we would think to omit it entirely, of course. No, at the very least, we will impress upon readers that it was the climax of your hero's journey."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"T-Truly? I never would have guessed... But then if I could, I suppose I wouldn't have had to ask."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"'Tis a tremendously eye-opening answer, and we will see that your account of this battle features prominently in the tome!"},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"I know you'd love to talk <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> ear off, Moren, but we really should be on our way. Those documents from Eulmore won't collect themselves."},{"name":"MOREN","text":"Of course, of course. And afterwards, would you care to join me for tea? I was hoping you might clarify a few points in your treatise..."},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"Till next time, then. Do tell the others to look after themselves."},{"name":"BEQLUGG","text":"Our overzealous friend, in particular─remind him not to overexert himself. Again and again till his ears fall off, if that's what it takes for him to take it to heart."},{"name":"ARKIL","text":"(-???-)&lt;gasp&gt; Is that the Warrior of Darkness!?"},{"name":"RIQITIO","text":"It's <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>! It's really <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>! What are you doing here?"},{"name":"RIQITIO","text":"If you're going to battle, I can give you some medicine! I made it myself!"},{"name":"EIRWEL","text":"Best not, Riqi. You'd only give <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> a stomachache."},{"name":"EIRWEL","text":"We've come to see Moren. To get his advice."},{"name":"EIRWEL","text":"One of the guard finally agreed to teach us how to fight. But first, we need to choose a fighting style."},{"name":"EIRWEL","text":"While I know that I want to be a mage, Arkil isn't sure."},{"name":"ARKIL","text":"Magic isn't really my thing. So I was thinking of taking up the axe. Or the sword. Or maybe the bow!"},{"name":"ARKIL","text":"They all seem all right, but it's hard to decide, so I thought I'd ask Moren. He knows about lots of things."},{"name":"ARKIL","text":"He isn't here? Awww..."},{"name":"RIQITIO","text":"Ooh, ooh! Why don't you have the Warrior of Darkness choose for you?"},{"name":"RIQITIO","text":"What do you think suits Arkil best? Axe, sword, or bow?"},{"name":"Q4","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A4","text":"For smiting your opponent, the axe."},{"name":"A4","text":"For protecting your friends, the sword."},{"name":"A4","text":"For fighting and hunting both, the bow."},{"name":"RIQITIO","text":"The axe... If you took up the axe, you could be just like..."},{"name":"CRYSTALIUMCHILDREN","text":"(-All-)Ardbert, the Warrior of Light!"},{"name":"RIQITIO","text":"The sword... If you took up the sword, you could be just like..."},{"name":"CRYSTALIUMCHILDREN","text":"(-All-)Branden, the Warrior of Light!"},{"name":"RIQITIO","text":"The bow... If you took up the bow, you could be just like..."},{"name":"CRYSTALIUMCHILDREN","text":"(-All-)Renda-Rae, the Warrior of Light!"},{"name":"RIQITIO","text":"I <span class=\"emphasis\">love</span> that tale! Let's borrow the book today!"},{"name":"EIRWEL","text":"It's really popular, though. I hope it's still there..."},{"name":"ARKIL","text":"Thanks for helping me decide, Warrior of Darkness! I'll start with that style, and maybe try something else later on."},{"name":"ARKIL","text":"And when I get really strong, I hope to have a bout with you!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-???-)Hmph... Such fun <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span>'s been having basking in the adoration of musty old bookworms and wide-eyed younglings, but does <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> spare a thought for me? Of course not!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"(-???-)I waited and waited and waited, but <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> won't so much as acknowledge the presence of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> beautiful branch even though they're right here! Such a heartless thing our sapling is! Cold and cruel and <span class=\"emphasis\">heartless</span>!"},{"name":"Q5","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A5","text":"Uh...Feo Ul? I...er, need you?"},{"name":"A5","text":"O faithful Feo Ul, loveliest of branches! How I have missed you!"},{"name":"A5","text":"Don't you have more important things to do, Your Majesty?"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"Why do you say it like a question!? Where's the love, the respect─the <span class=\"emphasis\">awe</span>!?"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"...But disappointed as I am, I'll overlook it this once. I know you have a lot on your mind right now."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"If you truly missed me, you should have cried for me at the top of your lungs the instant you arrived!"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"To make up for it, you will call with <span class=\"emphasis\">twice</span> the passion next time. Though for there to <span class=\"emphasis\">be</span> a next time, you've some few struggles to overcome."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"I've no end of important tasks to attend to, but unlike some, I know what my priorities should be! And since when did my sapling become a twisted old tree that says such unkind things!?"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"...But disappointed as I am, I'll overlook it this once. I know you have a lot on your mind right now."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"So, my adorable sapling. The world is on the verge of destruction, is it?"},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"Hehe, how do I know this? Joined as we are, spying on you is as simple as sliding down the back of a rainbow."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"Would that I could aid you in your quest...but the fate of we fae folk is bound to that of the star. Whither it goes, so too do we follow. Such is our way."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"The most I could do for you is spare you the pain, by gifting you the sweetest of eternal dreams..."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"But if escape's not to your liking, then you must struggle with your fellow mortals."},{"name":"FEOUL","text":"Ah, but here are the ones you were waiting for. I wonder, what manner of conclusion awaits at tale's end...?"},{"name":"LYNA","text":"My apologies for the delay."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! It's so wonderful to see you again!"},{"name":"LYNA","text":"You doubtless have much catching up to do, so I shall leave you to it. I've taken the liberty of unlocking the Umbilicus, and you may enter at your leisure."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I'm relieved to hear that everyone is well."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I've had this feeling, like a pit in my stomach, and I was afraid that something might have happened..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Maybe I'm overthinking things, but...it's just that..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I'm the Oracle of Light, but I've never spoken with Hydaelyn. Never once heard Her call."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Even so, I've always had this feeling deep inside me. A connection to something immense."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"These past few days, though, that connection has...wavered. As if that immense something was distant, then close, then distant again..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"And then, the other night, I was jolted awake by the feeling it had been completely severed."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Wanting some fresh air, I went to open the window...and to my horror, the sky was ablaze. Like during the starshower..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"But then I blinked, and everything was normal. The next day, no one said a thing. No one else had seen what I had seen."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"As far as I could tell, nothing was out of the ordinary. I began to wonder if it was a figment of a half-remembered dream..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>...? What are you not telling me?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I have to know─please! It doesn't matter how terrible it is!"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"It wasn't my imagination, then. The doom we witnessed in Amaurot has come again..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I can't believe it..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Like I told you before, all is well here in the First."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"So don't worry about us. Please. Look only to the threat before you."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"We're fine right now, and even if we weren't, we've learned how to survive."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Should the Final Days reach us here as well, you may be assured we won't go quietly."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"No, we'll hold on until you can find a way to save all our worlds."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"So long as you continue your fight, so too will we, united in purpose beneath a blazing sky."}],"reward":{"gil":893,"items":[{"id":35696}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":86,"id":142}],"quests":[69954]},"next":[69956]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1040386","obj":{"i":1040386,"n":"G'raha Tia","l":3707,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1039992","obj":{"i":1039992,"n":"Ryne","l":2951,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"35696","obj":{"i":35696,"n":"Ironwood Weapon Coffer (IL 539)","l":1,"c":26557,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"69954","obj":{"i":69954,"n":"At World's End","g":11,"l":"Radz-at-Han","s":572}},{"type":"quest","id":"69956","obj":{"i":69956,"n":"Hope Upon a Flower","g":11,"l":"The Crystarium","s":574}}]}
