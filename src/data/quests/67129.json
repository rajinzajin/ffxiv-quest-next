The knight cannot abide this state of affairs, and has asked you to stoke the fighting spirits of her sentries─/psych them up, in her own words.","Your wild gesticulations elicit a variety of responses from the sentries, one of whom is Lord Emmanellain. Ser Marielle will doubtless find the young lord's reaction the most interesting of all.","According to Ser Marielle, there has been a noticeable change in the sentries' behavior, which she ascribes to your efforts. But when you tell her of Lord Emmanellain's sudden desire for more demanding work, she can only chuckle nervously at the thought of what is to come."],"objectives":["Find sentries and /psych them up.","Report to Marielle."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MARIELLE","text":"Excepting your recent clashes with the Vanu, it cannot have escaped your notice that things here are rather peaceful─to the detriment of our garrison's discipline."},{"name":"MARIELLE","text":"Despite being built as an observation post, we have yet to record a single intrusion by the Horde.
