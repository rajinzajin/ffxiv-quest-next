The ssstuff of legends..."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"There's still a chance that some imperials are holed up inside the castellum. We'll need to search it top to bottom to be sure it's safe."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"In the meantime, I want you to rendezvous with the main host. Keep your weapons at the ready─there's a chance you might come face–to–face with soldiers on the run en route."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"On second thought, it might be prudent for you to do a preemptive sweep of the region for soldiers that have gone to ground. We shouldn't afford them any time to regroup and launch a counterattack."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"When you've judged your work to be done, report to General Aldynn in Bittermill."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"Just because we've won doesn't mean it's over yet.

Splendidly done."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It'll take more than one castellum to turn the tide."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"My men and I will deal with the remaining enemy forces.
