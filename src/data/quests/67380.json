Though he is glad to know the plants still survive in the scorched soil of the Four Arms, he fears for their chances of thriving. To secure their survival, he bids you collect five of the seedlings and deliver them to Moggzia, head gardener of Moghome, to be replanted in kinder climes.","You successfully collect five crackleweed seedlings from the Four Arms. Travel to Moghome to deliver them into Moggzia's green-fingered paws.","You deliver the seedlings to Moggzia, who agrees to replant them in his hilltop haven. Since Nidhogg's roar drove the dragons into a frenzy, the scalekins' wanton acts of destruction have brought much of the local flora to the brink of extinction. But as long as moogles like Moggzia are around, the plants and flowers of the Churning Mists have a fighting chance of thriving in pastures new."],"objectives":["Collect crackleweed seedlings.","Deliver the crackleweed seedlings to Moggzia."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOGEUGE","text":"Do you hear that snapping noise, adventurer?
