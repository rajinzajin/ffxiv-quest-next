There's an event over in middle La Noscea. “A Very Cherry Bomb,” it's called, and it just about captures everything adventuring's about, according to my way of thinking."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"We're resourceful, is what we are. And we find the <span class=\"emphasis\">fun</span> in even the gravest of dangers. Take the recent years: there's beastmen rustling about everywhere, making some afraid of their own shadows."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Here in La Noscea, we've been bled but good by kobolds. There's a lot of folk been burned by their alchemical contraptions, like those damn bombs."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"You know about bombs? You can kill 'em dead a thousand times, but if the core's intact, they'll just pop right back. You've got to blow 'em up good, core and all, and that's where <span class=\"emphasis\">we</span> come in."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Bomb disposal─that's an adventurer basic! But do the commonfolk know that? Not many do, so we'll show 'em─but we'll find the fun like we do. We'll dispose of the bombs in fireworks!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"You're the very <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> for the job─fearless and merry both! You and J'nangho should get on like a house on fire. You'll find her northeast of the Zephyr Gate, out in middle La Noscea."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Why aren't you in middle La Noscea? You're the very one for the Very Cherry Bomb event, or my name isn't Haermaga! J'nangho's the one to talk to. You'll find her down northeast of the Zephyr Gate."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Someone who does all three events─now that's what I call an adventurer! Loves the trade, ready for a bit o' fun, never stingy with <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> guild. An adventurer like that gets a special reward out of my own purse!"},{"name":"JNANGHO","text":"Welcome to a Very Cherry Bomb, and a very good day to you, fellow adventurer! If you love the smell of gunpowder in the morning, you've come to the right place!"},{"name":"JNANGHO","text":"I have six mortars set up at two disposal sites, one to the north and one to the east. All are packed with fireworks─enough gunpowder and bacon fat to turn bomb cores into fried bread!"},{"name":"JNANGHO","text":"And speaking of bombs, I've released some Bombard blanks in the area. They're your disposal targets, you see! I made sure to choose particularly dim-witted ones so they'd not wander off."},{"name":"JNANGHO","text":"Blast the Bombards towards the mortar until the gunpowder catches fire, and <span class=\"emphasis\">ta–da</span>─fireworks! Bomb cores disposed, fireworks in the sky...and the crowd goes <span class=\"emphasis\">wild</span>. Do I love this job? You bet your ash!"},{"name":"JNANGHO","text":"You got all that? Great! Just have a look around, get that energy flowing...then talk to me when you want to start.
