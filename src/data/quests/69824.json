Well done, little one!"},{"name":"HIPPOTHOE","text":"Magnificent creatures, the both of you. It's a shame we cannot give you a pair of tiny wings and a bell too, but it's against protocol, I'm afraid."},{"name":"HIPPOTHOE","text":"The ailouroi are enchanted with theirs at birth, so they are able to acclimate properly."},{"name":"HIPPOTHOE","text":"I'm certain you have your own unique potential to rise to, however.
