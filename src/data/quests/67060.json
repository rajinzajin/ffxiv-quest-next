While impending matrimonial festivities would ordinarily be a cause for gladness, the fact that the groom-to-be is no longer among the living has left the Lalafell deeply perturbed. Paiyo Reiyo indicates that he means to consult a former comrade and fellow invitee regarding the strange affair, only to learn from you that she, too, has been dead for some time. Racked by uncertainty, he requests to see Liavinne's grave with his own eyes. Meet Paiyo Reiyo at the Church of Saint Adama Landama, and show him where your fellow Scion was laid to rest.","Arriving at the lichyard, Paiyo Reiyo is dismayed to find Liavinne's grave despoiled and her body missing. He believes that Edda is the one responsible, having lost her battle with despair in the aftermath of her fiancé's death. The Lalafell departs for the Tam–Tara Deepcroft forthwith, determined to put an end to whatever madness his erstwhile comrade is about to commit. Given Edda's admiration for you, it seems likely that your presence will prove valuable to this endeavor. Make your own way to the Deepcroft, and speak with the Wood Wailer guarding the entrance.","Huguemont informs you that a Lalafell fitting Paiyo Reiyo's description recently entered the Deepcroft, and in the company of a maiden garbed all in white. Venture into the crypt, and aid Paiyo Reiyo in ending Edda's madness.<br><br>※The Tam–Tara Deepcroft (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","Within the depths of Tam–Tara, you come face-to-face with Edda, and succeed in thwarting her dark ritual. Her plummet into the abyss is a sight you will not soon forget. Turn your attention now to Paiyo Reiyo, and see how he has weathered the ordeal.","With the unsavory affair put to rest, Paiyo Reiyo reveals that he has lost the will to continue adventuring. Before he is able to finish speaking, however, he abruptly breaks into a flurry of apologies, and flees like a man possessed. It would seem the Lalafell's troubles are not yet over..."],"objectives":["Examine Liavinne's grave at the Church of Saint Adama Landama.","Speak with Huguemont at the Tam–Tara Deepcroft.","Enter the Tam–Tara Deepcroft (Hard).","Speak with Paiyo Reiyo at the Tam–Tara Deepcroft."],"dialogue":[{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"Uwaaah!"},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"...Huh?

Your superiority as an adventurer was obvious to me long before you became a household name. Our paths crossed near Sastasha, you see.

We used to adventure together, she and I and two others."},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"Our little group didn't last very long, though. Things fell to pieces when Avere, our leader and Edda's fiancé, met his end in the Tam–Tara Deepcroft."},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"Harsh words were exchanged, and we all went our separate ways.

Something isn't right, I tell you."},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"Now, in the letter, Edda wrote that Liavinne─that's the fourth member of our group─had already agreed to attend. They chanced to meet each other recently, from what I could gather."},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"Not knowing what to make of it all, I thought it wise to consult Liavinne about the whole strange affair before replying. But last I heard, she'd joined the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, and I didn't have the first idea how to go about tracking her down... Not until the greatest Scion of them all appeared, that is. Could you tell me where I might find her?"},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"...In the lichyard of the Church of Saint Adama Landama? I-I'm sorry, I don't─ Slain in an imperial raid, you say...?

Well, I was going to say “sense,” but... <span class=\"emphasis\">Gods</span>..."},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"I will try to explain. To the rest of us, our little party of four was but a means to riches and glory─such things as adventurers seek. But to Edda, it was her life..."},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"She blamed herself for Avere's death, and to our shame, we agreed with her─though we knew full well we were all to blame. And then we left her where she stood with her fiancé's <span class=\"emphasis\">head</span> for company..."},{"name":"PAIYOREIYO","text":"Ack!

Together, we'll put an end to whatever madness Edda is planning."},{"name":"HUGUEMONT","text":"A Lalafellin thaumaturge? Just so happens a fellow like that went into the Deepcroft not a minute ago.
