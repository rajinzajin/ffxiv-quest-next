As you were the old man's pupil, however, he suggests that the news is best delivered by you, and points you to the dignified samurai in front of the Quicksand.","You break the bad news to the dignified samurai, whose shoulders visibly slump. Regaining her composure, she introduces herself as Makoto of the Sekiseigumi, the peacekeeping force of Kugane. Desiring to pay her respects to Musosai, she asks that you show her to his resting place at the Silver Bazaar.","En route to the Silver Bazaar, you are set upon by ravenous fiends, but they are no match for you. Having neutralized the threat, you turn to tell Makoto that it is safe to continue on.","Apologizing for standing idle as you fought, Makoto confesses that she wished to make certain you were indeed Musosai's pupil. Your sublime bladework has lifted any doubt she may have harbored, and she sets off once more for the Silver Bazaar.","Having paid her respects to Musosai, Makoto shares with you her reverence for your master. While others branded him a craven for refusing to commit seppuku, she knew in her heart that he had a greater purpose, and your very existence has reaffirmed this belief. She goes on to reveal her reason for coming to Eorzea: to entreat Musosai's aid in fighting a faction of insurgents led by none other than his wayward pupil, a man named Ugetsu. However, this was not to be, and she takes her leave to return to her distant homeland.","Momozigo thanks you for taking care of Makoto during her brief stay. Though concerned for the Sekiseigumi's struggles, he concedes that there is little that can be done from the other side of the world. Sending you on your way, Momozigo asks that you pay him a visit every so often, lonely as it is without old Musosai around.<br><br>※The next samurai quest will be available from Momozigo upon reaching level 63."],"objectives":["Speak with the dignified samurai.","Join Makoto near the Silver Bazaar.","Speak with Makoto.","Join Makoto at Musosai's grave.","Report to Momozigo at the Quicksand."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"Oh, I almost forgot to mention. A woman had come calling on Musosai at the inn. Judging by her appearance, she's a compatriot <span class=\"emphasis\">and</span> a samurai."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"At that time, I couldn't bring myself to break the news to her. But in hindsight, perhaps it's best that it came from you anyway, seeing as you were Musosai's pupil."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"The visitor is in front of the Quicksand. You'll recognize her by her dignified air."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"The visiting samurai is in front of the Quicksand. You'll recognize her by her dignified air."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"Hm? You appear to be a samurai, yet you are not of our land. May I ask who addresses me?"},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"Well, that you should be Master Musosai's pupil! Tell me, where might I find him?"},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"...Is that the way of it? Words cannot well express my sorrow. I had the honor of being acquainted with your master in the past."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"(-Makoto-)Permit me to introduce myself. I am Makoto of the Sekiseigumi. Ours is the peacekeeping force of Kugane, a port city in Hingashi."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"(-Makoto-)I journeyed across the seas hoping to meet with Master Musosai, but it seems I must settle for paying my respects. Might I trouble you to show me to his resting place? The Silver Bazaar, you call it?"},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"(-Makoto-)I am in your debt. Let us away, then."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"Thanks for breaking the news, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, and for agreeing to take her to see Musosai. A friend of his is a friend of ours, I reckon."},{"name":"POPMESSAGE","text":"You are under attack!"},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"There is no mistaking your bladework─indeed, Master Musosai trained you."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"Forgive me for standing idle as you fought, but I had to make certain that you spoke the truth."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"Master Musosai seldom took on pupils, you see. But any doubt I may have harbored has been utterly dispelled. Now then, let us continue on."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"A beautiful ocean view. He will surely be at peace here."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"As you may know, Master Musosai had one other pupil before you. Ugetsu is his name, and he is wanted in Hingashi for the murder of countless dignitaries in the bakufu, our nation's government."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"Though his weren't the hands that wielded the blade, Master Musosai created the killer, and in the eyes of the law he was deemed no less responsible."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"As a samurai, he was expected to commit seppuku in order to atone for the crime, but he refused. As a result, he was branded a craven in Hingashi."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"But naught could be further from the truth. Master Musosai fled not because he feared death, this I knew in my heart."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"And beholding your bladework, I know now what it was that he sought to do. He wished to make amends by training a new pupil."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"Such was the shame he felt, death was not sufficient atonement. Nay, the only way he might know peace was to begin anew, with a worthy successor who would bring him honor."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"Know that Ugetsu is no common killer. He is a notorious insurgent who seeks to tear down the status quo. No few samurai sympathize with his cause, and every day more rally to his banner."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"For a time he remained in hiding, but our operatives report that he has recently resurfaced in Kugane. By all indications, he is poised to strike a heavy blow against the bakufu."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"'Twas for no other purpose but to petition Master Musosai's aid that I journeyed here. Alas, it was not to be. As I came, so too must I return─alone."},{"name":"MAKOTO","text":"My thanks for showing me here. Brief though it was, 'twas an honor to meet you."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"You took her to see Musosai? Doubtless he was happy to have a visitor, and one from his homeland besides."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"...So the wayward pupil is up to no good again. It's certainly worrying, but there isn't much outsiders like us can do. We can only hope that Makoto and her comrades will triumph over this Ugetsu."},{"name":"MOMOZIGO","text":"I'll let you return to your business, but pay me a visit from time to time, you hear? It's lonely without the old man around."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The next samurai quest will be available from Momozigo upon reaching level 63."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The requirements for undertaking subsequent quests can be reviewed in your journal."}],"reward":{"gil":778,"xp":167400},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":111}],"questsType":"all","quests":[68101,67895]},"next":[68103]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1021836","obj":{"i":1021836,"n":"Momozigo","l":40,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022185","obj":{"i":1022185,"n":"Dignified Samurai","l":40,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022186","obj":{"i":1022186,"n":"Makoto","l":42,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022189","obj":{"i":1022189,"n":"Makoto","l":42,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68101","obj":{"i":68101,"n":"The Face of True Evil","g":160,"l":"Ishgard","s":600,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67895","obj":{"i":67895,"n":"The Far Edge of Fate","g":5,"l":"Gridania","s":19}},{"type":"quest","id":"68103","obj":{"i":68103,"n":"Trials of the Sekiseigumi","g":160,"l":"Ul'dah","s":630,"f":1}}]}
