{"quest":{"name":"A Play in Three Acts","location":"Ul'dah","id":67865,"patch":3.35,"sort":113,"icon":100555,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1017488,"target":1017488,"involved":[1000100,1000972,1001353],"genre":202,"journal":["The leader of the Crystal Caravan is on the lookout for an experienced adventurer.<br>※This quest is available for a limited time only.","Among the festive trappings of the Ruby Road Exchange you hear a voice call out to you, and upon turning to answer you see it belongs to an exotically dressed Lalafell. She introduces herself as the leader of the Crystal Caravan, a traveling puppet troupe. The group plans to mark the anniversary of the realm's rebirth by putting on a play depicting the Calamity, but the actor assigned the part of the Warrior of Light would like more information to fully bring his role to life. On top of that, the script the troupe has been given is proving less than helpful in determining how best to act. Desiring to host the most entertaining show possible, the troupe asks you to bring their would-be hero to the Quicksand, that he might hear Momodi's version of events and use her story to inform his performance.<br><br>※Please note that you will not be able to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, check the Lodestone.","Momodi is eager to share her recollections of the events of five years past, and laments that none can remember the faces or names of the Warriors of Light. She stresses that at the very least, the selflessness of their deeds should be remembered, and the Crystal Caravan's actor promises to live up to her request. The Quicksand proprietress suggests visiting Baderon at the Drowning Wench, so you might gain further knowledge of that fateful day.","Baderon furrows his brow in an attempt to remember the events surrounding the Calamity, and recalls the day the Eorzean Alliance took to the battlefield under the specter of Dalamud. He tells of how the dreadwyrm Bahamut burst forth from the moon, blanketing the land with flame. The old pirate further says that although they faced certain doom, the troops fought on, until almost as suddenly as he appeared, the dragon vanished from the skies. Although no one knows exactly what happened, the realm was spared certain annihilation. The budding thespian is once again inspired, pledging to capture the heroism of the soldiers and the ferocity of Bahamut. Baderon suggests you ask one more person for their tale: Miounne at the Carline Canopy. Sensing that his muse is stirring, the actor departs for Gridania.","Miounne takes a more somber tone in her recollection, and at your companion's behest tells you of the Archon Louisoix. She says the man is much loved in Gridania, even now, and that he often worked together with the Warriors of Light. His sacrifice at the Battle of Carteneau is remembered by one and all, and Miounne's words encourage the Crystal Caravan star to immortalize the Archon's deeds on the stage. With his muse stirred from its slumber, the actor returns to Ul'dah, where he will commence rehearsing his role with a new fervor.","The Crystal Caravan leader thanks you for your aid, but before you can leave the rest of the troupe appears with grave news: the star actor has been injured, and cannot take the stage. Crestfallen that they might miss an opportunity to perform, the troupe is about to give up when their leader is struck with a brilliant idea. She suggests that you take the stage in the injured actor's stead, a suggestion to which you readily agree. Although you are inexperienced, the ventriloquists assure you they can carry even the poorest acting. Steel yourself to give the performance of a lifetime, and speak with the Crystal Caravan leader once you are ready to begin preparations for the play."],"objectives":["Speak with Momodi at the Quicksand.","Speak with Baderon at the Drowning Wench.","Speak with Miounne at the Carline Canopy.","Speak with the Crystal Caravan leader at the Ruby Road Exchange."],"dialogue":[{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"By the Twelve! You there! You have the gait and the looks of someone bound for greatness!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"I reckon you've already taken part in your fair share of daring deeds, exciting escapades, and astounding adventures! A worldly <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">lad</span></span> such as yourself might even make an audience swoon, if only you were to try your hand at theater!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Believe me, I would know. I've spent the larger part of my life turning even the most ineloquent boors into masters of the stage, so I know immediately when I'm in the company of true talent. And you, my friend, have talent to spare!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Who am I, you ask? Why, I'm the leader of the Crystal Caravan, the realm's premier puppet troupe. As it happens, I was just looking for an adventurer like you. You see, my leading man is having trouble finding the proper inspiration for his role. I was wondering if perhaps we might draw upon your worldly experience to give him a push in the proper direction."},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Excellent, excellent! Then without further ado, let me introduce the rest of the troupe!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"'Tis an honor to meet you, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">m'lady</span><span class=\"alternative\">m'lord</span></span>, and I hope our time together is fruitful. On the anniversary of our realm's rebirth, our troupe shall depict the tragic events of the Calamity. I shall play the role of the legendary adventurer─the Warrior of Light!"},{"name":"NEWBORNMENTOR","text":"You are doubtless thinking, “But I thought you were a puppet troupe!” Indeed we are, but we strive to set ourselves apart from the rest. I urge you to try and find another troupe as lively as ours! You shall not!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEEL","text":"Of course, the puppets still play a vital role. My partner and I provide the voices, endowing even the most crudely carved piece of wood with a personality of its own. I only hope you are able to provide our actor here with the inspiration to keep up with us."},{"name":"NEWBORNFLYMAN","text":"Aye, a soulless performance is a shame to behold, but there'd be no show at all without puppets─or a stage! You can go ahead and thank me for those two indispensable elements. The audience may not see my face, but I appreciate their applause all the same!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"It is with this talented crew that I hope to move the hearts of Eorzea's people and win their acclaim!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"It has been our dream to perform a play which lingers in the minds of its viewers long after the curtain falls! Indeed, 'tis my hope that this production will be remembered for years to come!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"But of course, an ambitious concept is nothing without a first-rate script! Which is why we sought out Eorzea's foremost author of stories, poems, and songs to write it. However, the draft we've received from him is quite, shall we say, open to interpretation."},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"In fact, I'm not sure if I would call it a script at all. It's more of a...general outline of events. The others insist it's a work of genius, but I just can't see it..."},{"name":"NEWBORNMENTOR","text":"Madam, you must look past the words on the page! A play is a living thing, and the playwright has given us the opportunity to let our imaginations run wild. Stirring dramas are born from the reactions of the crowd, the passion of the actors, and yes, even the weather can make a performance more lively."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"A stirring drama, yes. That is what we must deliver! To that end, my acting should be informed by knowledge─by the experiences of those who lived through the day firsthand. And who better than an adventurer to aid me in gathering such tales?"},{"name":"NEWBORNMENTOR","text":"I understand the proprietress of the Quicksand, Mistress Momodi, has a soft spot for adventurers like yourself. She likely has a wealth of stories to share. Good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, if you could ask her to regale our star with but a few, the Crystal Caravan would be in your debt."},{"name":"NEWBORNFLYMAN","text":"And they say adventurers only seek their own glory! You have our gratitude, friend! I reckon you might even put my puppets to shame, eh?"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"Well then, let's be off, shall we? To the Quicksand!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"With your help, we'll make a hero out of him yet!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"So this is Mistress Momodi? Seeing her so hard at work fills me with determination. And...something else. Is this...? Ah, no, no, I cannot let myself get distracted. Come on, let's see what she has to say about the Calamity!"},{"name":"MOMODI","text":"Welcome, welcome! Come to celebrate the anniversary, have you? Couldn't have picked a better place, I say. What can I get for you?"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"Greetings, Mistress Momodi. I am a humble actor of the Crystal Caravan, and we plan to celebrate this momentous day by retelling the story of the Calamity. I come before you to hear any stories you may have of that day, so I might draw upon them to inspire my performance."},{"name":"MOMODI","text":"Well, ain't that somethin'! I'd be happy to oblige you, of course."},{"name":"MOMODI","text":"Let me see, let me think... Right, five years back, was it? I remember it like it were yesterday, the lesser moon comin' down hard, growin' bigger and redder by the moment."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"Indeed, the moon burned as fiercely as the sun, and grew larger besides. Such a sight made many fear the end of the world was at hand, and rightly so."},{"name":"MOMODI","text":"Makes me shudder even now to think of it. But not all of us were shiverin' in fear. There were those courageous few who fought on against the odds."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"You speak of the Warriors of Light. Heroes worthy of song and celebration. Alas, none can remember what they look like, or even their names. 'Tis a shame, truly."},{"name":"MOMODI","text":"Right, a damn shame. All the more reason why your play is important! Even if we can't remember them, we can't let 'em or what they did for us be forgotten."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"Of course, Mistress Momodi! And thank you, for reminding me of the gravity of our responsibility. I shall do my utmost to ensure the memory of the Warriors of Light lives on!"},{"name":"MOMODI","text":"You call on Baderon over at the Drownin' Wench yet? Ought to if you haven't. I'm sure he'd be eager to speak with you─just remember to ask nicely!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"A brilliant suggestion! That settles it then! Let us away to Limsa Lominsa, and speak with this Baderon. Mistress Momodi, it has been a pleasure!"},{"name":"MOMODI","text":"Reckon there's more than a few with high expectations for this play of yours. I trust you lot won't let them down, eh?"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"So this is Baderon? He looks jovial enough. Come, let us see what he has to say."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"Yer a festive-lookin' pair, ain't ye? If ye ask me, there's no better place to celebrate the anniversary o' the Calamity than right 'ere at the Drownin' Wench! Well then, what's yer poison?"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"Greetings, Master Baderon. I've come seeking advice to aid in my own celebration of sorts: a stage reenactment of the very events this day commemorates. I would much appreciate if you could share with us any stories you might have."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"A reenactment, ye say!? Bugger me, that sounds like a grand idea! But afore I get to ramblin', I should warn ye my memory ain't what it used to be..."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"I remember the whole lot of 'em Alliance boys an' girls marchin' off to Carteneau. Dalamud was 'angin' overhead like a sword 'bout to drop from the sky, an' there'd been talk about callin' upon the Twelve to stay its descent."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"I can scarce imagine the fear they must have had to overcome, to set foot on a doomed battlefield."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"'Twasn't a task for the faint of 'eart, goin' toe-to-toe with the Garleans beneath the blood red moon. Every man an' woman what fought that day's deservin' of our respect."},{"name":"BADERON","text":"Wasn't there meself, o' course, but the survivors said that naught could be 'eard over roar of the battle. That is, till Dalamud burst open an' that thrice-damned bastard of a dragon Bahamut showed 'imself."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"Bahamut, the primal that set Eorzea aflame. No matter their strength in numbers, how could anyone hope to win against such an enemy?"},{"name":"BADERON","text":"They couldn't. But then, just as they were all bracin' to be burned to cinders, the dragon up an' disappears in a flash o' blindin' light. Ain't a soul alive who knows the 'ow or why of it."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"I see... Master Baderon, you have my thanks for sharing your story! I shall do my utmost to ensure that our audience remembers the bravery of the soldiers that day. Ohhh... Knowing the full weight of my responsibility makes me all the more nervous!"},{"name":"BADERON","text":"Some might say that's a good thing! Anyroad, I ain't the only one ye ought to be askin' about that day. I'm sure Miounne of the Carline Canopy'd be 'appy to tell ye a tale or two."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"Of course. One can never have too much inspiration! Adventurer, let us depart to the Carline Canopy at once. Master Baderon, thank you again!"},{"name":"BADERON","text":"That one certainly doesn't want for passion, eh? I'll 'ave to try and see if I can't make my way to Ul'dah and see this play in person."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"I must say, if I had the time I'd be inclined to spend more than a few nights here. Unfortunately, we have no such luxury─we must remain focused on the task at hand! Now, let's speak with Miounne and see what she has to say."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"In looking to the past, we take solace in the present, and think of what the future may hold... Ah, pray forgive me. At this time of year, one cannot help but wax poetic. How may I be of service?"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"It is an honor to make your acquaintance, Mistress Miounne. I have been tasked with portraying the storied Warriors of Light in a play which will commemorate the events of the Calamity. If you would be so kind to tell me of the Archon Louisoix─a resident of this very city I believe─I would be grateful!"},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Archon Louisoix? Indeed he resided here in Gridania. His sacrifice during the Battle of Carteneau is something we shall never forget."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"Perhaps if you were to tell me more of him and his relationship with the Warriors of Light..."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Oh, he had worked closely with the Warriors of Light, even before Carteneau, and on that fateful day he took charge of the Alliance forces, they did not hesitate to fight under his command."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Had they not been there to hold back the relentless assault of the imperial army, many believe that Master Louisoix would have not even had the time to beseech the Twelve for aid."},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Alas, in the end, both the Archon and those brave heroes gave their lives in our defense. Though we can never thank them enough, during this solemn time we must honor their sacrifice."},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"To honor the bond that Louisoix and the Warriors of Light shared, and to commemorate their brave deeds, I pledge to bare my soul on the stage! Just as they risked their lives in the fighting, so too shall I act as if my life depends on it!"},{"name":"MIOUNNE","text":"Then I am certain you will receive a standing ovation!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"You have my sincerest gratitude, Mistress Miounne. As do you, adventurer. I feel my muse stirring at last! It's time to rehearse, rehearse, rehearse! Adventurer, pray inform the others that I shall set to work at once!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHERO","text":"I must say, I am quite eager to see what sort of play they put on. Look for me in the crowd!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Welcome back! It appears your research was certainly a success! Our future Warrior of Light set to rehearsing most enthusiastically."},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"I owe you my thanks, good adventurer, for introducing us to such colorful and knowledgeable characters!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Now, we must begin preparations! Of course, we've prepared a space for you as the guest of honor. May the tale of the Calamity bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart."},{"name":"NEWBORNFLYMAN","text":"Chief, the bloody beam, it fell right on top of him! Gods be good!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Him!? What beam!?"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEEL","text":"Our lead was rehearsing the Battle of Carteneau─most passionately, I might add─when he knocked one of the puppets into an unstable beam, which then fell over and knocked him off the stage. He'll recover with time, but only the Twelve know when he'll be fit for theatrics!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Heavens forfend! Just when I thought our problems had been solved... To think his newfound passion was what led to this..."},{"name":"NEWBORNMENTOR","text":"Although it grieves me greatly, I see no choice but to postpone our show. It would seem fate does not favor us today. &lt;sigh&gt; ...I'll go and break the sad news to the public..."},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"W-Wait, I just thought of something! We have an adventurer right here, don't we? And one with no small amount of talent!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Yes, you can channel your own experiences and bring the heroics of the Warriors of Light to life! The more I look at you, the surer of it I become!"},{"name":"NEWBORNMENTOR","text":"Madam, I believe you may be on to something. Of course, it stands to reason that an actual adventurer would be most suited to play the role of one. Why did we not see it before?"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEEL","text":"Can we really expect a novice to move the audience? Still, I must admit I would rather not disappoint our fans."},{"name":"NEWBORNHEEL","text":"And I suppose greatness does sometimes spring from improvisation. Yes... Perhaps we have a chance after all! Besides, our voices should be able to carry the performance. So, what say you? Will you take the stage?"},{"name":"NEWBORNFLYMAN","text":"Well now that that's settled, I'll get the puppets and the stage ready. No more falling beams─you have my word!"},{"name":"NEWBORNHEAD","text":"Feeling a bit of stage fright, eh? Worry not, my friend, my troupe is more than capable of bringing even the most wooden performance to life. Just act from the heart, and I'm sure you'll impress. Well then, whenever you're ready, just let me know! Until then!"}],"reward":{"gil":627,"items":[{"id":15812}],"xp":3360},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}]},"next":[67866]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1017488","obj":{"i":1017488,"n":"Crystal Caravan Leader","l":40,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000100","obj":{"i":1000100,"n":"Mother Miounne","l":52,"q":21,"t":"Carline Canopy Proprietress"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000972","obj":{"i":1000972,"n":"Baderon","l":28,"q":26,"t":"Drowning Wench Proprietor"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1001353","obj":{"i":1001353,"n":"Momodi","l":40,"q":27,"t":"Quicksand Proprietress"}},{"type":"item","id":"15812","obj":{"i":15812,"n":"Heavensward Orchestrion Roll","l":1,"c":25945,"t":94}},{"type":"quest","id":"67866","obj":{"i":67866,"n":"The Show Must Go On","g":202,"l":"Ul'dah","s":114,"r":1}}]}
