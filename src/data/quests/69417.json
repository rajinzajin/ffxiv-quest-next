To facilitate the process, he bids you return to Vesper Bay and speak with Hozan, a Doman who has been tasked with managing the first wave of departures.","As their departure draws ever closer, Hozan must account for all his charges, including a number of young children. To that end, he asks that you speak with his son, Yozan, who he believes may be able to help.","Hozan is proud of his son, and with good reason: Yozan has already instructed the other children to make their preparations. The only ones who have yet to be located are a trio who were engaged in a game of hide-and-seek. It would seem that the children are very serious when it comes to the game, and will not move from their hiding spots unless found, leaving you with no choice but to find them yourself.","Despite their dedication to the game, the three remaining children were not particularly good at it. Inform Hozan that your work is finished.","You learn that Yugiri is responsible for the children's regular practice of hide-and-seek, as she deemed it necessary to ensure their survival in the event of an imperial attack. Many would consider it a valuable skill, to be sure─albeit one Hozan hopes the children never need to use."],"objectives":["Speak with Hozan in Vesper Bay.","Speak with Yozan.","Search for the children in hiding.","Speak with Hozan."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To accept this quest, you must abandon the current main scenario quest.

In short: whatever must needs be done, do it."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Speak with a man named Hozan when you arrive.

However, they are vital to ensuring the safety of the refugees for their pending journey."},{"name":"HOUZAN","text":"Greetings. Alphinaud informed me that a Scion would be arriving to help with the preparations. I am honored to meet you, though shamed as well. A great warrior should not be tasked with such trivialities."},{"name":"HOUZAN","text":"Aye, I knew from a glance what manner of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> you were.

Pray seek out my son Yozan. He can tell you more."},{"name":"HOUZAN","text":"These have been trying times, but Yozan has handled himself well. I only wish there were more I could do for him."},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"Oh, hello there! I'm Yozan, son of Hozan. Will you be coming with us to Ul'dah? I hear we're traveling by horsebird-drawn carriage!"},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"But...don't you think they're <span class=\"emphasis\">queer</span>? Giant birds that people ride like horses? I still want to try riding one, but─"},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"What's that? You're looking for the others? Don't worry. I already told them to get ready for the carriages."},{"name":"YOUZAN","text":"I'll need your help, though. We were just finishing a game of hide-and-seek. Three players are still in hiding, and since Lady Yugiri told us to take it <span class=\"emphasis\">really</span> seriously, they won't move until they're found. But Vesper Bay isn't that big, so I bet you can find them in no time!"},{"name":"KOHARU","text":"Hey! You're not Yozan!

It is quite simple, really."},{"name":"HOUZAN","text":"Lady Yugiri thought it best that the children know what to do in case the Garleans found us."},{"name":"HOUZAN","text":"I should hope that those days are behind us, but I nevertheless take comfort in knowing that we are prepared."}],"reward":{"gil":1658,"items":[{"id":6255,"one":1},{"id":6256,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":5825,"one":1}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":50,"id":142}],"quests":[69416]},"next":[66888]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1008623","obj":{"i":1008623,"n":"Alphinaud","l":40,"q":7}},{"type":"npc","id":"1008639","obj":{"i":1008639,"n":"Hozan","l":42,"q":3}},{"type":"item","id":"6255","obj":{"i":6255,"n":"Hero's Ring of Casting","l":90,"c":54543,"t":43}},{"type":"item","id":"6256","obj":{"i":6256,"n":"Hero's Ring of Healing","l":90,"c":54543,"t":43}},{"type":"item","id":"5825","obj":{"i":5825,"n":"Allagan Silver Piece","l":25,"c":26001,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"69416","obj":{"i":69416,"n":"Promises to Keep","g":2,"l":"Ul'dah","s":23}},{"type":"quest","id":"66888","obj":{"i":66888,"n":"Why We Adventure","g":2,"l":"Western Thanalan","s":27}}]}
