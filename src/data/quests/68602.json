We're in the midssst of preparing a shipment of goods to the M tribe. Might I trouble you for assistance in their delivery?"},{"name":"ESHANA","text":"Normally we would deliver them by cart, but the contentsss of the containers are quite fragile."},{"name":"ESHANA","text":"We've had no choice but to assemble a band of carriers to sssend them by hand, taking care not to run afoul of the beasts that roam these lands."},{"name":"ESHANA","text":"Speak with the Resistance guard at the eastern end of the bridge. He will tell you what needs to be carried and to where."},{"name":"WATCHER03066","text":"Eshana sent you to help with moving the goods, did she? Well the help's certainly welcome. We've got plenty of packages but too few hands to carry them."},{"name":"WATCHER03066","text":"Think you could handle the satchel there on top of the boxes?"},{"name":"WATCHER03066","text":"You'll be taking it to the Peering Stones. A merchant of the M tribe should be expecting you near the entrance."},{"name":"PEDDLER03066","text":"Excuse me, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>.

A merchant from the M tribe will be waiting for you at the entrance to the Peering Stones."},{"name":"PEDDLER03066","text":"A package from the Ananta? Oh, yes, of course! Pray forgive me, I was expecting a soldier from the Resistance."},{"name":"PEDDLER03066","text":"To be honest I'm surprised they have any merchandise to sell. Nearly everything they have is sent to the soldiers fighting on the front line."},{"name":"PEDDLER03066","text":"To be honest I'm surprised they have any merchandise to sell. Nearly everything they have is sent to Ala Mhigo to help with the restoration."},{"name":"PEDDLER03066","text":"Still, their goldwork and textile goods are quite popular. It's surprisingly easy to reap large profits despite the great sums we pay for their wares."},{"name":"PEDDLER03066","text":"But I've kept you long enough. Once everything is accounted for it's off to the markets with me. When you return to the castellum, pray tell Eshana I will visit soon to thank her personally, as well as deliver their share of our earnings.

I trust the shipment was sssafely delivered?"},{"name":"ESHANA","text":"Thank goodness. I was concerned they might leave without our wares."},{"name":"ESHANA","text":"Time with the Resissstance has taught us not everything must be done on our own. It can be advantageousss to work with others, all contributing their unique abilities to accomplish a common goal."},{"name":"ESHANA","text":"Through the M tribe we can sell our wares. And through adventurers sssuch as yourself, we can more easily secure our livelihood."},{"name":"ESHANA","text":"Thusss can the Gatekeepers afford to focus their efforts on helping others in need.
