They can, believe it or not, although the soul in question is not their own, but that of their <span class=\"emphasis\">owner</span>."},{"name":"SWYNBROES","text":"Through faithful service, the arms and armor that we use come to hold our spiritual energy. Thus do we form a <span class=\"emphasis\">spiritbond</span> with them."},{"name":"SWYNBROES","text":"This spiritual energy can be drawn out and converted into materia, a special kind of crystal that can be attached to gear to enhance its properties."},{"name":"SWYNBROES","text":"I am well versed in the ways of materia extraction. If you wish to learn more about the process, it would be my pleasure to teach you."},{"name":"SWYNBROES","text":"You are ready to commence your learning? Good. As you will have gathered by now, materia is the crystallized form of one's spiritual energy."},{"name":"SWYNBROES","text":"As this energy is derived from an individual's psyche─a volatile beast at the best of times─a degree of variance is to be expected in its production. In practice, this means that you won't know the exact properties of a stone until you cradle it in your hand."},{"name":"SWYNBROES","text":"Now, materia won't grant you much of anything on its own. Its power must be tapped, see, and this is achieved by melding it to gear. Know, though, that it takes the deft hands of a craftsman to meld materia."},{"name":"SWYNBROES","text":"You can always seek others to attach materia on your behalf, but if you would sooner do it yourself, I recommend you speak with F'hobhas.
