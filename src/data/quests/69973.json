Although the reasons to do so are as diverse as the company you keep, it is decided that you will chase down and confront the chief overseer and his creation.","You arrive at the front door to find the facility in a state of alert. The scholars milling outside seem oblivious as to who sounded the alarum or why, but for you and your companions, the circumstances of this emergency are crystal clear. Wary of what other obstacles Hermes may have placed in your path, you assign roles, square your shoulders, and prepare to march into the magically expanded environs of Ktisis Hyperboreia.<br><br>※To enlist your companion NPCs for this duty, speak with them near the entrance or access Duty Support via the main menu. Use the Duty Finder if you wish to complete the instance alongside fellow players.","You fight your way through the many fields and floors of the facility until at last you reach the highest platform in Ktisis Hyperboreia. There awaits an unrepentant and transformed Hermes, who refuses to surrender Meteion into the Convocation's custody. A tempestuous battle ensues, but in the end, your efforts to subdue the chief overseer prove successful...","Silent until now, Hermes's question about happiness amongst the stars prompts Meteion to step forward and describe the anguished desperation of the races she encountered. She declares her intention to relieve all life of the burden of existence, and Hermes, after binding your company in chains of aether, accepts this ultimatum as a challenge to the worthiness of mankind. In order to ensure the “fairness” of this determination, the chief summons Kairos to alter the memories of everyone present, such that all that occurred since your arrival in Elpis would be wiped clean. Before the process begins, however, he bids Meteion escape to the edge of the universe, knowing that he will soon believe her and her sisters to have perished in an accident. It is then that Venat breaks her shackles and chases the entelechy into the sky. Likewise freed of your bonds, you and Hythlodaeus distract Hermes, while Emet-Selch tears a hole in the spatial confluence to afford you an escape route. Venat returns from her failed pursuit just in time to have Argos bear you both through the portal and evade the Kairos-induced amnesia. Hythlodaeus and Emet-Selch are not so fortunate, and now it falls to you and Venat to remember─and safeguard─your respective realities.","Rested somewhat from the encounter, you listen in sadness as Venat explains what will likely become of Hermes now that Meteion is gone. In an instant, it seems that so much was lost, but there is much that remains for you to do..."],"objectives":["Speak with Venat.","Enter Ktisis Hyperboreia.","Speak with Venat."],"dialogue":[{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Do <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> understand why Hermes would do this? His logic escapes me entirely..."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"If all Hermes means to do is listen to Meteion's report, then it is his right to do so."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"But once he receives the answers to his question, what then? The fate of the world may very well hinge upon the choice he makes in that moment...and we must be there when he makes it."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Hermes has headed to Ktisis."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Considering the expansive dimensions of the place, even we may have a difficult time locating his aether. All I can say is that he entered from the rooftop, and likely arrived at the uppermost point in the facility."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"So...do we pursue him?"},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Of course we pursue him. No matter what Hermes might be thinking, Meteion is a potential threat that needs to be brought under our control."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"The Convocation's duty to safeguard this star takes precedence over any personal stake in the matter."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Venat? <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"VENAS","text":"'Tis clear we stand on a precipice, but we have yet to determine beyond a shadow of a doubt that Meteion's is the hand which tips us over the edge."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"Nevertheless, if we are to learn the truth of the Final Days, we must give chase. And even if neither Hermes nor Meteion is ultimately responsible, we cannot leave them to suffer this torment alone."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Agreed on all counts. To Ktisis Hyperboreia we go!"},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"I mislike the look of this..."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Judging from the crowd, something is afoot."},{"name":"HYPERBOREIASTAFF","text":"I saw naught out of the ordinary. Does anyone know what caused it?"},{"name":"VENAS","text":"What have we here...?"},{"name":"VENAS","text":"Excuse me, has something happened inside Ktisis?"},{"name":"HYPERBOREIASTAFF","text":"Mistress Venat! I'm so glad you're here!"},{"name":"HYPERBOREIASTAFF","text":"No one knows what prompted it, but the alarum was sounded and Ktisis put into a state of alert."},{"name":"HYPERBOREIASTAFF","text":"Procedure dictated that we evacuate immediately, and we have yet to investigate further..."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"...This is Hermes's doing. Obviously."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"And what does this “state of alert” entail exactly?"},{"name":"HYPERBOREIASTAFF","text":"A field of dampening magick is draped over the entire facility, usually in response to escaped entities and the like."},{"name":"HYPERBOREIASTAFF","text":"Ktisis scholars and observers are unaffected, but everything─and everyone─else is weakened to a fraction of their usual capabilities."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Then consider us forewarned. We do, however, have urgent business with Chief Hermes, and must enter the premises regardless."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"...That said, if Hermes is willing to enact such measures, I wonder what other obstacles he has seen fit to drop in our path."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"With that enfeebling spell in place, we're not like to be at our fighting best."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"And I was hardly an effective combatant to begin with! I've little to offer beyond my aetherial vision."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Then you will put that talent of yours to good use.

Now you've gone and raised everyone's expectations..."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"You all need only make the most of your strengths, and I will fill in the gaps as required."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"I was once Azem, after all. 'Twas my job to rise to the occasion─be that as defender, aggressor, or healer."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"I feel better about my lack of prowess already!"},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"And you, Emet-Selch, can impress us with your arcane majesty. You lob potent spells as easily as breathing, but can also channel that power in a protective manner if you so choose, yes?"},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Eh!? Well, yes, should the situation call for it..."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Excellent! That should cover us on all fronts."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"Your tale led us here, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, so 'tis only right that you lead us now.

In spite of this, I have gained one useful thing:"},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"An awareness of dynamis. To think that a power with the potential to corrupt aether had largely escaped our notice..."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Whether or not I believe your tale, the facts underpinning your narrative will be the source of much debate."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"So understand that I act not for the sake of you or your fantastical quest.

And I will be there too, of course, cheering you on!"},{"name":"VENAS","text":"Bleak as the contents of Meteion's report might be, many could hear it and remain content with their lives."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"But not Hermes. For him, the veneer of perfection has long been cracked, and it was to the distant heavens he looked for the means to repair it."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"I understand his anguish after a fashion─my own refusal to return is in opposition to the world's established order."},{"name":"VENAS","text":"Yet for me, the imperfections only enhance the fragile beauty of our star.
