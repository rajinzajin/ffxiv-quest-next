Before you may do so, you will first need to claim ten bloody boar tusks from the wild boars that dwell in his dominion. Make your way to the Bramble Patch in the East Shroud, and bring your lance to bear upon the boars that reside there.","You have obtained ten bloody boar tusks. Place them upon the patch of trampled earth by way of an offering.","You have made an offering of the bloody boar tusks. Now you need but wait for the Lord of the Bramble Patch to grace you with his presence.","You have emerged victorious in the contest by virtue of your courage. Make your way back to the Lancers' Guild, where Ywain awaits.","Unable to bear Ywain's scorn, Foulques has fled into the depths of the forest. Though a bitter draught to swallow, this experience may yet give him cause to reconsider his beliefs...or so one would hope.

Most impressive. You are ready to face the trial."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Yet I did not exaggerate when I said it would be dangerous.

You must go before this fearsome creature and stand your ground."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Know, though, that the Lord of the Bramble Patch will not grant an audience to just anyone.
