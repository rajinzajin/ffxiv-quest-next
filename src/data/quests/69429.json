You had best take up your dragonsung tool right away if you are to present Denys with enough supplies for his goblin team.<br><br>※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Your toil is rewarded with pot upon pot of mysterious gobbiegoo, and at last you are able to present Nimie with a sufficiency of the substance.
