I mean, I was still surprised, but I've never once doubted his judgment. None of us have. If he thought Lyse was the best choice, then she is."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"(When did <span class=\"emphasis\">Lyse</span> become leader of the Resistance? That...that is... Hm. I suppose we have Hien to thank for this too.)"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I understand M'naago's concern. If they were to lose another leader so soon after losing Conrad, the Resistance might never recover."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"(More than a keeper, she needs a friend now. Stay close to her.)"},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"One can but wonder how the rank and file of the XIIth Legion will view their leadership upon hearing about the fate of Specula Imperatoris."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"Grim though it is, the conjurers have had no choice but to impose a rigid triage system when treating the wounded. Under the circumstances, we have to be realistic."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"Mark my words: when this is over, I will take the heads of every officer in Castrum Abania. I'll swing the bloody axe myself if I have to!"},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I still can't believe it. Conrad, and so many others, dead. It's not right, what those bastards did... It's not right."},{"name":"VMAHTIA","text":"You wouldn't believe the two fools we caught skulking about in imperial uniforms. It felt good handing them over to the Alliance...though it all feels pointless now."},{"name":"JMOLDVA","text":"Conrad always treated us with kindness and respect. His death will not go unavenged."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"If you don't mind, I'd rather not wait around and have people try to talk me out of it. Let's get moving. I know a good vantage point overlooking the castrum."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Nyunkrepf's Hope</span>─the ship stranded on the rocks to the east of here. It shouldn't take us long to get there. Oh, but there might be some ancient golems guarding it. Or that might just be an old wives' tale. Either way, it's worth the risk."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"Lyse...Commander...I pray you proceed with all due caution. Do not hesitate to call upon us if needed."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"To reach the ship, we'll have to scale the cliff face. I'll get some climbing gear and meet you there, all right?"},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"The ship dates back to days of the great flood. The legend goes that it was teleported onto the rocks by magick. No idea if it's true, but I'll be damned if I know how else it could've got up there."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Sorry to keep you waiting! I see you've met the golems. Looks like the old stories were true, eh? In a way, I'm glad..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Right, then. Time to climb!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; Whew! That took a bit more out of me than I expected..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"And here she is. <span class=\"emphasis\">Nyunkrepf's Hope</span>. The ark that one man made to save countless others from the flood during the Sixth Umbral Era."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"It's comforting to think that there have <span class=\"emphasis\">always</span> been people who cared this much about their fellow man─who accomplished such great feats that people couldn't help thinking they must be made up. But the proof's right here, isn't it?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I don't just mean the ship, you know. I mean you. Long before anyone started calling you a hero, you were there for those in need. You did things for people when you didn't have to─sometimes even when they didn't want you to."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"It can't have been easy, staying true to yourself. But we're all better for it. Me included."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I'll never be a leader like Conrad. Or Hien. Or my father..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"But I can be a friend to you all, and I can fight by your side."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I can be me...and that'll just have to be enough, eh?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Strange to think back on it. If we'd been standing in different places, or if the shell had struck the tower differently, it would've been me instead of Conrad. Or maybe both of us."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"What kind of monster murders their own..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Uh... Is that smoke from Castrum Abania? Wait─it's coming from the cannon!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I can't tell what happened from here, but I <span class=\"emphasis\">can</span> tell that it won't be giving us any trouble in the immediate future."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"This is our chance, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─to avenge Conrad and all the others who died in the tower, friend and foe."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"To take Castrum Abania and bring the bastards who gave the order to fire to justice!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"It won't be easy after the losses we took, but I know everyone's champing at the bit to strike back. With the right plan, I'm certain we can do it!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We have to tell the others! Come on!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Easier down than up, eh? Though not necessarily safer..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Anyway, no time to rest! We need to convince the others to strike now, before the imperials have time to fix their cannon."}],"reward":{"gil":703,"items":[{"id":18661,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18664,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18666,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18667,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5683,"one":1}],"xp":232200},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":142}],"quests":[68075]},"next":[68077]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1020631","obj":{"i":1020631,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020633","obj":{"i":1020633,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020604","obj":{"i":1020604,"n":"Raubahn","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020628","obj":{"i":1020628,"n":"M'naago","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020629","obj":{"i":1020629,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020630","obj":{"i":1020630,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":6}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020632","obj":{"i":1020632,"n":"Pipin","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020638","obj":{"i":1020638,"n":"Serpent Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020639","obj":{"i":1020639,"n":"Storm Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022339","obj":{"i":1022339,"n":"Arenvald","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022340","obj":{"i":1022340,"n":"V'mah Tia","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022341","obj":{"i":1022341,"n":"J'moldva","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"item","id":"18661","obj":{"i":18661,"n":"Zelkova Longbow","l":285,"c":32329,"t":4,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18664","obj":{"i":18664,"n":"Molybdenum Rimfire","l":285,"c":34691,"t":88,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18666","obj":{"i":18666,"n":"Palladium Rod","l":285,"c":33081,"t":7,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18667","obj":{"i":18667,"n":"Gazelleskin Grimoire","l":285,"c":33231,"t":10,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"5683","obj":{"i":5683,"n":"Battledance Materia V","l":160,"c":20256,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Tenacity","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68075","obj":{"i":68075,"n":"For the Living and the Dead","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":990}},{"type":"quest","id":"68077","obj":{"i":68077,"n":"The Path Forward","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1010}}]}
