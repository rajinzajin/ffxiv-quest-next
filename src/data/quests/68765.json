While the forgemaster considers how best to repay your assistance, she mentions that Eismon was over at the Wandering Stairs and seemed eager to speak with you. Something about a celebration...?","You locate Eismon, and learn that the artisans are indeed planning to celebrate the forge's recent revival. As part of the festivities, they'd hoped to reclaim the ring Iola's father lost, but the moneylender in question is demanding more coin than they could possibly repay. Nee Marn, however, has a proposal involving the creation of another ring, and a dash of Nu Mou mischief. Synthesize an enchanting ring, and deliver it to Eismon's waiting hands.<br><br>※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Nee Marn's familiar.","You deliver the enchanting ring to Eismon. The time has come to attempt the trade with Walden at Musica Universalis.","With you at his side, Eismon approaches Walden, and offers to trade your crafted ring for Iola's keepsake. The moneylender balks at first, but after seeing the ring's exceptional quality, he soon changes his tune. Eismon returns to the Wandering Stairs, the surprise gift for Iola clutched tightly in his fist.","Once the celebrations are underway, Eismon presents the reclaimed ring to Iola on behalf of his Iron Bellows colleagues. For her part, Iola is overcome with emotion, and embraces her artisans as the family she's long been missing. Speak to the forgemaster in the aftermath of the festivities.","Iola once more expresses her gratitude for your tireless assistance, and assures you that the forge now has enough momentum to continue under its own steam. And if trouble does rear its head, the forgemaster is confident that she can handle it with the help of her three eccentric artisans. Should you ever find yourself missing the peculiar family at the Iron Bellows, Iola urges you to come and pay them a visit."],"objectives":["Speak to Eismon at the Wandering Stairs.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize an enchanting ring <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"></span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the enchanting ring <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Eismon</span></span>.","Speak with Walden.","Speak to Eismon at the Wandering Stairs.","Speak with Iola at the Crystalline Mean."],"dialogue":[{"name":"IOLA","text":"After sitting down and tallying up the profit from our various ventures, I'd say we have sufficient funds to keep the Bellows running comfortably for quite some time. Truly, your goods have brought in a small fortune."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Yet I still haven't thought of a proper way to thank you... While I'm busy with that, why don't you visit with Eismon? He mentioned wanting to have a word with you."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"I've noticed him sneaking about, trying to arrange a celebration with you and our clients, so I'm guessing he needs your help with the preparations."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Mwahaha! Nothing gets past me! In my forge, I see <span class=\"emphasis\">everything</span> my artisans do...or don't do, for that matter."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Last I saw, Eismon was over at the Wandering Stairs. Assuming you're of a mind to speak to him..."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, we've been looking for you. I have a favor to ask you..."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Celebration preparations?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Yes, Iola told me..."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Wait, what!? It was supposed to be a surprise!"},{"name":"COLANA","text":"Iola's head might be filled with figures and finances, but she's got a sharp eye. Should I bop her with my hammer so she forgets what we're up to?"},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Someone ought to bop <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> with a hammer, you uncultured brute."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Come now, Eismon, spit it out. Was there not something <span class=\"emphasis\">specific</span> you wished to share concerning the upcoming festivities?"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Oh, yes, of course. Part of our plan was to surprise Iola with a gift─something near and dear to her heart─but we're having trouble, uh, <span class=\"emphasis\">acquiring</span> the item in question."},{"name":"COLANA","text":"He's talking about the ring Iola's father lost to that bastard moneylender. The three of us have been working our fingers to the bone this past while, scrimping and saving what we could, all so we'd have the coin to buy it back."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Once we'd deemed our purse sufficiently hefty, we paid a visit to this nefarious usurer─a shifty fellow by the name of “Walden.”"},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Yet even after we paid the villain his due, he refused to surrender the ring. Apparently we'd failed to account for the “interest” accrued in the intervening years. A patently absurd amount..."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"We're at a loss as to what to do next. I was hoping someone as well traveled as you might have some advice to give."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Am I too early? I'm too early. &lt;snort&gt; I don't get invited to a lot of parties with people..."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"...You seem troubled. Is there a problem with the celebrations?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"So you paid this man a fair price, but he did not honor the trade? Demanded more from you?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"We of the Nu Mou frown upon deals where the balance of value swings too far in one side's favor. &lt;snort&gt; This Walden fellow sounds in need of a lesson in equilibrium..."},{"name":"COLANA","text":"Oh, I'd love to teach him a lesson, but the only one I can think of is like to leave me covered in blood and arrested by the guard..."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Let us not attempt anything rash─'twould only add to Iola's woes. Still, I'm afraid a <span class=\"emphasis\">civilized</span> approach has already failed to persuade that unmannered churl to part with the ring."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"&lt;snort&gt; No violence will be necessary, my friends. I have an idea."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"This is your moment to shine, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I'm going to supply you with some materials─use them to make a ring of finest quality, then give it to Eismon."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"I realize this is all very mysterious, but I ask that you trust me. Everything will be explained soon enough."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Did you catch up with Eismon? He was headed to the Wandering Stairs, last I heard."},{"name":"COLANA","text":"What a bloody mess..."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Confound it all..."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"I'll just...stand around here. Until the ring is ready."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Oh, well that didn't take near as long as I thought it would. That's beautiful work, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"So, Nee Marn... What exactly <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> the plan for this ring?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"The materials I provided to <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> were prepared with a minor enchantment. Walden will be so taken with <span class=\"emphasis\">our</span> ring that he'll be willing to offer Iola's ring in trade."},{"name":"COLANA","text":"What, just like that?"},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"I have doubts as well, but I say we give it a try."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Right, then, let's pay another visit to Walden. Will you come along, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? He should be lurking around Musica Universalis."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Did you meet with Eismon?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Did you run into difficulties forging the ring? Not to worry, I have some materials in reserve..."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"A ring, a ring, a wondrous thing, when its metal band hides a Nu Mou's sting!♪"},{"name":"COLANA","text":"I don't know what's going on, but I'm keeping a hammer handy. Just in case."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"We can but trust in the Nu Mou's sense of fairness. I am curious as to what mischief the flying pig has in mind..."},{"name":"WALDEN","text":"Eh? Back so soon?"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"We came for the ring, Walden. We already paid you a fair price for its return."},{"name":"WALDEN","text":"Let me spell it out for you again, boy: no money, no ring. You'll get naught but curses till you cough up the interest what's owed me!"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"We don't have that kind of money, but we do have another ring you might be interested in. Care to trade?"},{"name":"WALDEN","text":"Trade!? Do I look like a flea market to you!? I only deal in cold, hard coin!"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Oh? Maybe you should inspect the quality of the goods before you make up your mind. Here, see how it glitters?"},{"name":"WALDEN","text":"W-Well, ain't that a pretty little thing! I had no idea such beauty still existed in this world. It's just so...precious!"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"I had a feeling you would appreciate the, uh, the <span class=\"emphasis\">craftsmanship</span>."},{"name":"WALDEN","text":"Aye, it ain't often I get me hands on a proper treasure like this one... You've got yourself a deal, boy. Here, take your bleedin' ring─go on, take it!"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"A pleasure doing business with you."},{"name":"WALDEN","text":"Hee hee! Enjoy your worthless old antique. There's only one ring I care about now!"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"The way his eyes lit up was almost disturbing. Just what kind of spell did Nee Marn weave into those materials...?"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Well, we'd best be getting back to the others. The festivities aren't going to prepare themselves."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"You've made the ring, exactly as I asked. Just be sure Walden sees it, and everything will turn out for the best. I promise you."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Aye, that's Walden. I <span class=\"emphasis\">really</span> hate the part where he yells at me. I could do without the yelling..."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"A strange business, that, but at least we have the ring Iola wanted. Now we can celebrate without a care!"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"...Although we should probably finish up the preparations before the guests arrive."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Ahem. Iola, we have a gift for you."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Oooh, a gift! Is it flowers? Some sweet treat from the markets?"},{"name":"COLANA","text":"Hah! As if you'd want something as pointless as that!"},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"...Indeed."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Ahahaha! Aye, I'd rather a sack of coins than some smelly bouquet!"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Not a sack of coins, I'm afraid...but it is a precious metal."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Oh, Eismon, are you proposing? I know I'm pretty for a smithy, but this is all too sudden..."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"...Just a damn moment. Th-That's my father's ring! Where...? <span class=\"emphasis\">How</span>!?"},{"name":"COLANA","text":"We weren't able to stand by you when the Bellows needed us most, so we got back the thing you most wanted instead."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Fittingly, your efforts to revive the forge were the reason we could earn enough money to buy that trinket back in the first place─that, and a dash of <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s exceptional craftsmanship."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"I don't know what to say except...thank you. I'd thought myself alone since my father died, but it seems I do have family around me after all."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"&lt;snort&gt; And now we see the girl behind the forgemaster's mask. A bittersweet day."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"It's certainly been an interesting one. Speaking of which, you never did tell us what kind of enchantment you put on the moneylender's new ring. He all but snatched it out of my hand..."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Ah, that was naught magical─his desire for the ring was born entirely of mundane greed. I knew that an avaricious wretch such as Walden would soon see the value of <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s craft."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"My contribution was far less innocuous─a little curse of misfortune, to punish his unfair weighting of the scales. That man's financial luck is about to take a decidedly ugly turn for the worse."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"You needn't look so worried─I would never weave curses upon an upstanding trading partner such as you. Keep the balance, and all will be well between us."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Your efforts were successful, yes?"},{"name":"COLANA","text":"Huh, you got the ring back. I don't put much stock in wispy magicks you can't even see, but they seemed to have worked on Walden."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"I only hope that winning the ring back counts for something against the balance I owe Iola's family."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"It's good to see you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. All that excitement has left me feeling positively drained."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"All that proper food has left <span class=\"emphasis\">me</span> feeling unusually full."},{"name":"COLANA","text":"Ugh, well I feel like someone's been using my head for an anvil. Don't remember much after that tenth tankard..."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Shall I remind you, then? In your inebriation, you deemed it necessary to initiate a brawl with our Zun guest. The tavernkeep will be sending a bill for the destruction you caused to his establishment."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"You might have stopped her instead of making wagers on the outcome, Rend. Tell me why I rehired you people again?"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"...I suppose the answer to that is right in front of me. I still can't believe you managed to prise it from Walden's grubby hands."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"We couldn't have done it without <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and Nee Marn."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Aye, thank you again, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. You've been there for me every step of the way."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"From here on in, I think I can keep the Bellows running under its own steam. And if there's any trouble, I have these three miscreants to help me deal with it."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"You've left us in a good place, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but know you're welcome to come and visit any time you like."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"And don't forget to take your payment─you've certainly earned it!"},{"name":"COLANA","text":"Head, pounding... Belly, churning... No, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">dinner</span><span class=\"alternative\">breakfast</span><span class=\"alternative\">lunch</span></span>, stay down!"},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Colana can cover a disgustingly large area with her putrid retching.
