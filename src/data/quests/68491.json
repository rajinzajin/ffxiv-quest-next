Huh... What would you ask of me, then?"},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"A stranger and a generous soul besides? Bollocks. There's naught more suspicious than a good samaritan."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"...On the other hand, if you were an imperial agent, I expect you'd go about your business with more discretion. Bugger me, you really are here to help, aren't you?"},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"Very well. I'll take you up on your offer, stranger...<br>My little brother's working the rocks by Grymm & Enid. He's got something for me. Can you go and get it?"},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"Right, then. Frightened Coeurl is his name. Ask him for the leftovers─he ought to understand."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"You know where Grymm & Enid are, aye? West by southwest. Look for the bastard what looks like me, but less handsome."},{"name":"FRIGHTENEDCOEURL","text":"Hm? Here for the leftovers, are you? Not like my brother to send someone in his stead, but so be it."},{"name":"FRIGHTENEDCOEURL","text":"It's all in the sacks over yonder.

Hope you brought a pack bird."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"Ah, the new face. You have my leftovers?"},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"Huh, well I'll be...you actually went and brought the whole lot. Much obliged, much obliged..."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"It's saltpeter for making firesand, in case you're curious what it's all for. The rocks by the lakes've got good deposits."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"'Tain't hard for my brother to pass for any other plodding quarryman, all the while sweeping bits and pieces off to the side, to bundle up and sell to the sutlers what trade with the Resistance."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"It's a living, and a way of fighting back besides. Our way of spitting in the Garleans' eye for putting our father in an imperial uniform and shipping him off to some faraway province fifteen years ago."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"Dunno if he's dead or alive, even. Though, if he were alive, he'd not be long for this world if we were caught fighting for the Resistance. So this is the best we can do."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"...That's the long and the short of it. We do what we can, though we know it's not enough."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"I think you'll find that most folks here ain't much different. Everybody's got a reason, but in the end, the result is the same."},{"name":"ANGRYCOEURL","text":"I suppose I just...I just wanted you to know, is all. That I─that we know why you're here, and that even if we can't join you, we...we wish we could..."}],"reward":{"gil":615,"xp":167400},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":142}],"quests":[67992]},"next":[67993]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1020848","obj":{"i":1020848,"n":"Angry Coeurl","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020857","obj":{"i":1020857,"n":"Frightened Coeurl","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67992","obj":{"i":67992,"n":"The Prodigal Daughter","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":110}},{"type":"quest","id":"67993","obj":{"i":67993,"n":"A Life More Ordinary","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":120}}]}
