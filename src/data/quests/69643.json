On this occasion, however, it will be employed to purify the corruption that plagues the Twelveswood. The branches of the great one have been delivered across the Twelveswood, and the final one is to be placed in Gridania itself. Kan–E asks you to do the honors, and bids you follow her to the Leatherworkers' Guild, where the ancient tree that will receive the branch resides.","Branch in hand, you climb the massive tree until you find the spot of weathered bark the Elder Seedseer pointed out to you earlier. You affix the branch, completing the final connection and empowering the great one to extend its essence all throughout the forest with ease. The time has come to proceed to Everschade and carry out the ritual, that together you may bring a close to this dark chapter of Gridania's history.","Under the mighty boughs of the Guardian Tree, the Elder Seedseer makes ready to begin a ceremony which has not been seen since Dalamud fell. As if to stop her, Gleipnir emerges snarling from the woods, and Kan–E–Senna beseeches you for your protection. The blasphemy charges, and only you stand between its fury and Gridania's demise.","The battle is hard-fought, but you hold Gleipnir at bay long enough for Kan–E–Senna to summon the Irmin Hedge, rendering the beast's poison ineffective. Together you, the Elder Seedseer, and her Keeper bring an end to the blasphemy, and with it the tragic tale of Ea–Sura–Supin. The sacred wood that once held its breath in fear breathes a long sigh of relief. Though exhausted from events, the Elder Seedseer wears an expression of satisfaction and accomplishment.","With Gleipnir slain, the effects of its poison are much diminished. But there is no rest for the righteous, and Kan–E–Senna must journey home to Gridania and the many duties that await her. She asks that you visit her at the Lotus Stand upon your own return to the city.","As hoped, those weakened by Gleipnir's poison have already begun to heal, and once more Kan–E thanks you on behalf of her nation. She vows to remember Ea–Sura not as the blasphemy he became, but as the young boy who taught her that the elementals' blessing was not a burden, but a gift to be shared. And so, hand in hand with the elementals and her people, she will walk along a path into the future that they will discover together. But what of her faithful Keeper of the Entwined Serpents, who has been a constant presence at her side?","The Keeper of the Entwined Serpents is no less resolved than the Elder Seedseer to continue to serve Gridania. As his duties require that he remain at home, he bids you journey to Radz–at–Han to inform the officer there that there is one less blasphemy in the world.","The Gridanian delegate is joyed to hear of Gleipnir's demise─and more than a little relieved, given that you did not return quite as quickly as he had anticipated. He thanks you on behalf of his nation, and bids you farewell...at least, that is, until the next time the Twelveswood and her people are faced with a crisis once more."],"objectives":["Speak with Kan–E–Senna near the Leatherworkers' Guild.","Speak with Kan–E–Senna in Everschade.","Speak with Kan–E–Senna.","Speak with the silent conjurer at Nophica's Altar.","Speak with the Keeper of the Entwined Serpents.","Report to the Gridanian delegate in Radz–at–Han."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KEEPEROFTHEENTWINEDSERPENTS","text":"Impeccable timing, as always, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

We need only succeed in summoning the Irmin Hedge."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"You may recall that the great one's words were muddled and esoteric. I believe it was an instruction to carry out this esoteric ceremony in order to expunge the corruption befouling the forest, that the once-tainted earth may begin to mend."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"For you see, when the Irmin Hedge last was formed, it was to protect the Twelveswood from threats without. The great one acted as a guardian, embracing the woods to shield them as a father would his child."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"On this occasion, however, we will call upon it to nourish and revitalize, as a mother nurses her child to make them strong against sickness."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"In channeling the power of the elementals in this way, we can stem the spread of Gleipnir's poison, and the scars of its passing will finally heal."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"At least, that was what the great one intended to say, I believe."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"The Seedseer Council agrees with my interpretation and has permitted me to perform the ceremony."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"I have in my possession a single branch─the final one to be attached to the eldest tree of the Twelveswood.

You who have sacrificed so much for the sake of others. If we had even a sliver of your courage, we could move mountains."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Thank you, my friend.

There you must affix the branch."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You ascend the ancient trunk and affix the branch of the Guardian Tree to the weathered bark as directed by the Elder Seedseer."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"You are quite the climber.

Regardless, this day we shall bid farewell to Gleipnir."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Through the branches of the Guardian Tree, the Twelveswood is become as one..."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"In summoning the Irmin Hedge, every ilm of these sacred lands will be imbued with the great one's nourishing aether.

To share in its suffering. I was not there for you then, but I am here for you now. To unmake what you have become."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"I shall begin the ceremony.

One day, perhaps, but not this day."},{"name":"KEEPEROFTHEENTWINEDSERPENTS","text":"But...but Elder Seedseer─"},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Recent events have given me cause to reflect upon my past. Upon lessons that I once thought I had taken to heart."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"When I did not yet understand the duty with which I had been entrusted─when these horns of mine were but chains binding me to a destiny I did not choose."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"'Twas Ea–Sura who taught me to appreciate the gift I had been given. Had he not been there to help me keep to the proper path, where would my errant feet have taken me instead?"},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"He was perhaps the first, but he would not be the last. My brother and sister and countless other kind souls, through their words and their support, have also helped me to continue to find a way forward...even when I thought there was none."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"'Tis by opening our hearts to one another that we, in turn, open new paths─that we can conceive of greater opportunities and brighter futures. All who live within Gridania are deserving of these gifts, and so I must always be there for them, that together we may journey in safety through darkest night."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Not tempted to live wild and free like an adventurer?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You don't desire a life for yourself outside of your duties?"},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"...It is not without its appeal. I recall fondly the few occasions I have traveled beyond. Our time together in the Churning Mists left a lasting impression."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"If ever there came a time when I need no longer serve as Elder Seedseer, I should like very much to accompany you on another adventure."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"My life is my duties, and my duties my life. I do what I love, and desire naught else."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"But...if ever there came a time when I need no longer serve as Elder Seedseer, I would be forced to consider alternatives."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Perhaps I would do the same as Ea–Sura and settle down with my beloved. Finding and courting them would make for quite the adventure, don't you think?"},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Regardless of what the future has in store, my present course is clear. So long as we Padjal serve as a bridge between man and elemental, Gridania can weather any storm."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"And so I will continue to walk hand in hand with my people and my patrons, along a path that we discover together."},{"name":"KEEPEROFTHEENTWINEDSERPENTS","text":"Though the blasphemy is no more, there are still administrative matters to resolve.

May the elementals watch over and keep you."},{"name":"KEEPEROFTHEENTWINEDSERPENTS","text":"I would gladly go to Radz–at–Han myself in your stead, but the Elder Seedseer is adamant on resuming her duties at once, and so I too must go without rest.
