I've dedicated my life to studying and creating aquatic life, but my main focus is the development of new shark species."},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"My latest creation has completed its round of observation at Anagnorisis, and will be released after one final test."},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"The thing is, I'm hoping to consult with a taxonomist before the Bureau of the Architect hands down its official registration."},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"...The same one who named my last shark, if I can─“speude bradeos” was such a marvelous name."},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"It turns out it's rather difficult to track down a specific person in a place such as this. Could you help me?"},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"Thank you. Here, take this─it's a model of the previous creation I just mentioned. Whoever named it should hopefully be able to recognize it."},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"Show the shark to as many people as you can. Whoever recognizes it must be the one who named it."},{"name":"RHODOPIS","text":"Was there something I could help you with?"},{"name":"RHODOPIS","text":"...Who named this species? I'm sorry but I haven't a clue. Certainly not me."},{"name":"EUAION","text":"What have we here? A roaming familiar?"},{"name":"EUAION","text":"Ah, yes, the speude bradeos. I've heard of it before, but I'm afraid I don't know who named it..."},{"name":"TELAMON","text":"What's that you have there...?"},{"name":"TELAMON","text":"Oh, a speude bradeos! Of course I know it─I named it, after all!"},{"name":"TELAMON","text":"Its creator was calling it a “cladoselache,” but I decided to go with something more closely tied to its distinct way of moving."},{"name":"TELAMON","text":"I wanted to really capture the image of it rushing forward with its tiny steps, somehow swift and slow at once."},{"name":"TELAMON","text":"In case you were curious, the name comes from a proverb meaning “more haste, less speed.”"},{"name":"TELAMON","text":"And if the creator wishes me to name her newest creation, I would of course be honored to do so. It's in Anagnorisis, you say? I look forward to seeing it soon!"},{"name":"RHODOPIS","text":"I honestly have no idea who gave that shark a name."},{"name":"EUAION","text":"That creation is named so perfectly. If only I could come up with something so clever."},{"name":"TELAMON","text":"Oh, I can hardly wait to name this next shark creation!"},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"Any luck finding my taxonomist?"},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"You found him? And he's willing to give the new one a name, too? That is wonderful news!"},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"This latest creation is actually a direct improvement over the last. I gave it more legs for a total of eight so it can move even <span class=\"emphasis\">more</span> quickly over land."},{"name":"CREATOR04306","text":"With that taken care of, I need to hurry back to Anagnorisis. But before I go... Here.
