Aside from the name stenciled neatly on the parcel, the only tidbit of information he has to go on is that Uhm Ala has yellow scales. Unfortunately, many dragons residing in the towers fit this description. He thinks that maybe an experienced adventurer like you will have better luck delivering the package, and asks that you take over this assignment for him.<br>With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase that contains the name “Uhm Ala” to find the dragon whose package remains undelivered.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","You approach several yellow-scaled dragons, none of which turn out to be the great Uhm Ala. You do, however, gain some valuable insight from speaking to them, and now know to look for a regal dragon residing somewhere within the tower.

He is said to reside in Anyx Trine. Aside from this, we only know that he is yellow of scale."},{"name":"SEARCHER","text":"No matter how hard we try, we cannot identify the intended recipient. There are too many dragons with yellow scales! So every day we return, claws heavy, and no closer to delivering our package."},{"name":"SEARCHER","text":"We think maybe an expert adventurer like yourself can easily recognize him! Please, great hunter, take this to him. Uhm Ala must be very eager to receive his order."},{"name":"DRAGONA02277","text":"What is it you have come here for, child of man?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"With the chat mode in <span class=\"highlight\">Say</span>, use your keyboard or the software keyboard to enter any phrase that contains the name “Uhm Ala” to find the dragon whose package remains undelivered."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Uhm Ala"},{"name":"DRAGONA02277","text":"You think me to be the great Uhm Ala? How absurd! Would such a distinguished dragon be wandering about the lower levels of the tower like some common vagrant? I should think not!"},{"name":"DRAGONA02277","text":"Saying I look like Uhm Ala is akin to comparing one of your kings to a peasant. Hmph.
