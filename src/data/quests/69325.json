Namely, for you.","Following a brief bout of contemplation and postulation, Urianger arrives at the conclusion that in order to complete the cycle of rainfall and evaporation in the Empty, the elements of wind and fire must be restored simultaneously. Naturally, this means that the burden on Ryne and yourself will in effect be doubled, as you attempt to draw forth and meld the two contrasting types of aether. Not to be deterred, you both accept the challenge, though as Thancred points out, the increased strain will require you to be well rested before embarking on your next voyage. Gaia, impatient as always, storms off, while Ryne ponders over what might be troubling her.","Despite your best efforts to engage Ryne in conversation, she is reluctant to respond. Perhaps all she needs is someone to /rally her spirits.","Ryne explains that she has been worried about Gaia's well-being since before she awakened from her long slumber. Having been raised in isolation, Ryne has precious little experience in speaking with people of a similar age, and she is unsure as to how to approach Gaia. Given what the pair have in common, it seems reasonable to expect that they would be well matched as friends, although Gaia's sullen demeanor makes even approaching her somewhat daunting. Thancred encourages Ryne to take the first step and initiate conversation, while the rest of you silently observe the exchange from just within earshot.","Ryne overcomes her initial anxiousness and engages Gaia in some light small talk. Unfortunately, this is met with a less-than-favorable response, with Gaia expressing her distaste for Ryne's positive outlook before turning on her heels and making her way to Eden's core. Taking this as a cue, Urianger suggests that now would be the opportune moment to commence the next phase of the plan.","Urianger has selected Ashfall as the next location, once known for its searing heat and relentless winds. You conjure the images of Ifrit and Garuda while Ryne calls forth the necessary aether to give form to your memories, although some doubt lingers over Ryne's ability to focus on the task at hand. Putting such fears to one side, all that remains is for you to vanquish two raging primals at the same time. What could be simpler?<br><br>※Eden's Verse: Furor can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","Having survived the combined assault of the reimagined deities of fire and wind, you return triumphant to Eden's core. Ryne is already preparing to pilot Eden back to the camp in order to properly assess the effect that your victory has had on the ambient aether of the Empty.","Torrential rain pours down on the vicinity of your camp, though you and your companions are content to stand in the open as it leaves you all drenched through. While Ryne is clearly delighted by the results, Gaia's mood darkens and she launches into a tirade aimed at Eden itself, before clutching her head and making nonsensical utterances. She eventually returns to her senses, but it seems that her inner turmoil has only temporarily subsided."],"objectives":["Speak with Ryne.","/rally Ryne's spirits.","Survey the designated location.","Speak with Urianger in Eden's core.","Enter Eden's Verse: Furor.","Speak with Ryne."],"dialogue":[{"name":"THANCRED","text":"As much as I bemoan Urianger's long-winded explanations, we'd be lost without him to take care of all the aetherial science and whatnot.

It certainly would not be beyond the Allagans to manipulate the weather, if such is thy suggestion, but it is of naturally occurring phenomena that I would speak."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Ah, I spoke without regard for thy profession.

Those things simply didn't matter."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"But after Lord Vauthry disappeared and the night returned, everyone in Eulmore started thinking differently.

I'll start with some small talk and go from there!"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Actually, since before she even woke up, I've been asking Lyna about what's popular in the Crystarium.

I suppose it makes for a nice change of pace from all that studying."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"And I must commend thee on thy choice of confidant. The captain's powers of observation maketh her a veritable font of wisdom concerning the behavior of the Crystarium's citizenry."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Yes, and now it's time to put that knowledge to good use."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Don't let the fear of rejection hold you back. Persistence is the key."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Speaking from experience, by any chance?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Wh-Whatever do you mean!?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Lessons learned from days spent in pursuit of ladies fair, one might suspect."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Gah! You couldn't help yourself, could you!?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"It's all right, Thancred. Your secret's safe with me!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Ahem! May I remind you that the reason we're here is to create a better future for everyone in the First, which includes you and Gaia."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"While it might not be on the same scale as bringing life back to the Empty, if you're able to befriend her, that will be another way of contributing to a brighter tomorrow."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"So go on, she's waiting for you."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"All right. Wish me luck!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Ryne is ready to approach the decidedly unapproachable Gaia. You had best observe the conversation from within earshot."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Hmm...

You had best observe the conversation from within earshot."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"It's when Ryne and I face our problems together that it truly feels like we're family. Or at least, what I imagine it would be like. I suppose we both grew up without our birth parents to guide us, but I think we turned out rather well given the circumstances."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I wonder if this is the kind of bond that F'lhaminn shared with Minfilia..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Thancred may have taken on the role of Ryne's surrogate father, but I have of late become something of a mentor to her, though largely in instilling what knowledge I can of the aetherial sciences. A more attentive student thou shalt seldom find."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Instead of bothering me when I'm <span class=\"emphasis\">obviously</span> not in the mood to talk, why don't you get back to work?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Umm..."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"What do you want?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Oh!

Is everything all right? Not feeling strange from being around Eden or anything?"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Is that what you came here to talk about?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Actually... I wanted to ask you..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"W-Would you like to go and have coffee biscuits with me?"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"What!?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Coffee biscuits! They serve them at the Second Serving in the Crystarium. Everyone's talking about them, so I thought that maybe once we've finished our work here, you and I could go there together."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Let me get this straight. You came to talk to me about <span class=\"emphasis\">biscuits</span>?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Yes! They're light and crispy and when you dip them in the coffee they go all nice and squidgy!"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"The only reason you're even interested in that in the first place is because everyone else is doing it. Can't you think for yourself?"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"I do what I want, when I want. After all, the world could end at any moment."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"That's not going to happen! Not if I've got anything to do with it!"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Listen, Gaia. I understand what you're going through. Believe me, I do. But you mustn't lose hope! A new day will come. Then another, and another. Life's not so bad if you give it a chance, you'll see!"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Shut up! You think you know me!? Even <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> don't know who I am!"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Until I find the truth, I'll never be free."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Then we'll find it together!"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I've seen enough pain, enough loss, and I don't want to see any more! And that includes you, Gaia!"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Why do you care so much about other people? What have they ever done for you? I'm sure you haven't forgotten how we Eulmorans treated you, the precious Oracle of Light. Like a bird in a cage!"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"And yet, you act as if none of that ever happened. So forgiving, so selfless."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"You and your <span class=\"emphasis\">family</span> brought back the night sky, and you finally had the chance to lead a normal life. But instead, you're flying around in a giant sin eater, trying to turn a barren wasteland into some sort of paradise, and for what?"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"I may not remember much of my past, but I'm fairly certain I've never heard of anything so ridiculous. Out of morbid curiosity, I'll see it through to the end, but if you think that makes us friends, you are <span class=\"emphasis\">very</span> much mistaken."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Gaia!"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I surmise that to keep Gaia waiting overlong would only agitate her further."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I think we've both rested for long enough. Let's get started, shall we?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; I hope it all goes according to plan..."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Ryne's looking a bit down in the doldrums, but you let me worry about that. We can't allow anything to interfere with whatever goes on in your mind when summoning those primals."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Not you as well? Look, I've had enough small talk to last me a lifetime, so don't even bother. I believe you have a job to do, yes? Then be quick about it."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"To defeat the deiform manifestations of both wind and fire shall require every last mote of thy strength. That thou hast triumphed over such beings in previous encounters should be at the forefront of thy mind as we commence the summoning."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Where are we going this time, Urianger?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"The place called Ashfall doth satisfy our requirements, I believe. The fables speak of travelers sweltering beneath the blazing heat of the midday sun, while after nightfall, slicing winds did tear at their cloaks."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Hmm... I see. Hopefully it won't be quite that bad when I draw out the elements."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Ryne, my dear. May I remind thee that to focus is not the same as to deny other thoughts. Whatsoever it is that troubleth thee, thou wouldst be better for acknowledging it."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Yes, you're right, of course... It's Gaia that I'm worried about."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"That is well. May thy concern for her lend thee yet more strength."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"It's time. I'll begin drawing out wind and fire in equal measure."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, we'll only get one chance at this, so let's make it count!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Memories of Garuda and Ifrit rage through your mind..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"If we summon two primals at once, maybe they'll fight each other? That way, you'll only need to beat the one left standing. But I suppose it defeats the purpose of it if you don't take them both down at the same time."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"How long has it been since our encounter with Ifrit and his Amalj'aa followers?"},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"My studies indicate that no equivalent of Garuda's servants, the Ixal, are present here on the First. My hypothesis as to the reason why can perhaps wait till another time."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"I wonder what sort of hellish beasts you've conjured up this time?"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Combining the contrasting powers of different primals... That seems an awful lot like the Ultima Weapon. In any case, I'm pleased to see that you were as successful here as you were at the Praetorium."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"That two such ferocious beings should meld into a single entity is frightful indeed. Further research must needs be performed to fully comprehend this unexpected phenomenon."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"For a moment, I thought Ryne had lost control of the aether. Luckily, we managed to avoid any major disasters, from what I can tell."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"That was incredible! I never imagined they would fuse together like that, but you took them down all the same."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I suppose the main thing is that we're now two elements closer to restoring the aether of the Empty. Let's go and see what difference it's made!"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"It actually worked! Just like Urianger said it would!"},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Everything we could've hoped for."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Indeed, our endeavors have been repaid manifold."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I wonder what will happen when we restore ice?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Umm... Is something the matter?"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"One more element, and then what?"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"You'll have achieved the impossible, while I'll still be...nothing. No memory, no past, no family... Nothing."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"The world has moved on and left me behind. Anyone who ever knew me is either dead or gone."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"So, <span class=\"emphasis\">almighty</span> Eden, you can mend this broken world, but you can't restore one girl's memories!?"},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Give me my life back, damn you!"},{"name":"GAIAVOICE","text":"I still hunger..."},{"name":"GAIA","text":"Ahhh!"},{"name":"GAIAVOICE","text":"Extinguish the accursed Light...
