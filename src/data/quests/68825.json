The time I spend indulging these distractions is time you can use to continue your explorations.)"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"(For this excursion, I'd like you to delve into the layer below us, and sniff about the military headquarters. I'm sure the Understory has its own tale to tell...)"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"(Now is your chance to squeeze in another round of reconnaissance. Go─I will cover your absence should the Chais become suspicious.)"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"&lt;sob&gt; &lt;sniff&gt;"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"You...you're one of the bonded, aren't you? Like me?"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"Please, I need your help! My throat, it's... I can't sing anymore..."},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"I've been making excuses, but it's just not getting any better. If my patron thinks I'm of no use to him, then... &lt;sob&gt;"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"I need you to sneak out to the Derelicts and describe my condition to Thoarich."},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"Here's a list of symptoms, and a hunk of meol to pay for his medicines... Please, I have no one else to turn to!"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"...You don't know the Derelicts? It's the mess of shacks and ships right outside Joyous Hall."},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"That's where the apothecary lives. Or at least, that's what I heard..."},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"Hee hee! You need medicines? Tonics? Potions?"},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"Hmmm, a cure for an ailing voice, is it...?"},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"No, no medicine will cure this. Methinks your songbird has a lump in her throat. It must be cut out, excised, and even then the voice may never heal completely."},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"Hee hee, poor little songbird. Will they kick her from the nest, I wonder? Or simply silence her chirps?"},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"Hoho, your face! You didn't know!? Of the many hopefuls who enter the city, very few are ever seen to leave. Even as corpses..."},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"Oh, you might see one or two fortunate fools hurled from the balconies, but the rest...? Gone."},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"A town of nightmares, it is. Not for this ship's rat, oh no no. I am content to scurry around down here, and nibble on the crumbs which fall from the table."},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"This consultation is over! You have my verdict, and I have my meol! Good day!"},{"name":"THOARICH","text":"All the old hands, they know, oh yes, they know. They just don't like to talk about it. Wouldn't want to upset the status quo, hee hee!"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"D-Did you get my medicine...?"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"&lt;sob&gt; ...So that's it? What am I to do if I can't sing...?"},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"Ah, there you are, my sweet canary. Have you been crying again? Don't tell me your voice is still not on the mend..."},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"Oh, generous sir, have mercy! I've done all I can, but even the apothecary said..."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"...So you've been suffering all this time?"},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"I am sorry, my pet. I hadn't realized your affliction was this grave... But you needn't fret! I'll not reward your hours of trilling by casting you out into the street!"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"You are too kind, sir..."},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"But what use am I if I cannot sing? I fear the day I become more burden to you than treasure..."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"Then I shall have a word with Lord Vauthry, and arrange for your ascension."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"In that paradise where resides neither pain nor illness will your song ring out clearly once again."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"...Or mayhap you think it a step too far?"},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"No, I... You would do that for me!?"},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"Of course. Why, I would almost wish to hasten my own ascension, knowing your blessed instrument was waiting there to greet me."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Ascension...?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Sounds too good to be true..."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"Ah, you must be a new arrival. Allow me to explain."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"Ah, you must be a new arrival to harbor such doubts. Allow me to allay your suspicions..."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"As all know, the sin eaters exist to devour the sinful. But also do they serve to gather the souls of the innocent, and shepherd them unto celestial paradise."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"It is through Lord Vauthry that we learned this truth. It is through Lord Vauthry's grace that the free people of Eulmore are destined to embrace salvation."},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"We are blessed to spend our days surrounded by love and merriment, until at last we are called to our final rapture. Even the bonded may find a place within that host, should their patrons deem them worthy."},{"name":"SINGER03289","text":"Lord Vauthry truly is a great man, isn't he?"},{"name":"GENTLEMAN03289","text":"Now if you will excuse us, we must be on our way. May you find eternal salvation for the compassion you have shown my precious canary."},{"name":"DULIACHAI","text":"Oh, dearest, we really should have found you some new gloves."},{"name":"CHAINUZZ","text":"Yes, my love, you're probably right..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"'Tis good to see you back. You were taking so long I began to worry something had happened."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I've begun sketching an outline for the portrait, but...nay, the Chais appear otherwise occupied. Will you share what your investigations have gleaned thus far?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"So...Lord Vauthry boasts some manner of influence over the sin eaters, does he? That would explain the reverence in which he is held by the citizenry."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"And as for this “ascension” business, I cannot help but be put in mind of that apothecary and his ominous remarks. If so many folk have entered the city over the years, then where do they go...?"}],"reward":{"gil":788},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":142}],"quests":[68824]},"next":[68826]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1029837","obj":{"i":1029837,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2952,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1028990","obj":{"i":1028990,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2952,"q":2}},{"type":"quest","id":"68824","obj":{"i":68824,"n":"A Taste of Honey","g":8,"l":"Eulmore","s":100}},{"type":"quest","id":"68826","obj":{"i":68826,"n":"Emergent Splendor","g":8,"l":"Eulmore","s":120}}]}
