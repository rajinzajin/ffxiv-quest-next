He just isn't quite sure what it is yet.<br>※This quest is available for a limited time only.","The Impresario, pleased with your honest efforts on his troupe's behalf, has entrusted you with the most vital task of placing one final warding lantern in a dimly lit area by Apkallu Falls. Speak once more to the shifty thespian to obtain the necessary supplies.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You have obtained the final warding lantern and the means by which to light it. Proceed to place it as directed in the vicinity of Apkallu Falls.","The lantern having been successfully placed, proceed to light it with the bomb digit.","Upon lighting the final warding lantern, a curious voice speaks to you, raising doubts as to the true identity of the Impresario, and encouraging you to seek the truth from his troupe's purported patrons. Begin your investigation by speaking to Serpent Captain Uphanne at the Adders' Nest","Uphanne insists that the Order of the Twin Adder has had no dealings with the Impresario and his dubious band, saying that she heard they were personally invited to Gridania by the Elder Seedseer herself. Seek the truth from Hearer Damaris at Nophica's Altar.","Damaris insists that the Seedseers know nothing of the Impresario and his troupe, saying that she heard that they were invited by the Adventurers' Guild. Make for the Carline Canopy and see what Mother Miounne might know of the matter.","Hearing your words, Mother Miounne concludes that the Impresario is not who he claims to be. Use the sparkler she has given you to spook the dubious troupemaster into showing his true colors.","Spooked clean out of his costume, the Impresario is revealed to be an actual imp. As he tells it, he and his monstrous minions cooked up their scheme in hopes for a return to the old days, when All Saints' Wake afforded an opportunity for his kind to frolic and purvey mischief in town. Assuring you that he means no harm, you agree to keep his secret. All told, this has proven to be an eventful All Saints' Wake─though the true identity of the disembodied voice that guided you to the truth remains cloaked in shadows..."],"objectives":["While in costume, speak with the shifty thespian.","While in costume, place the warding lantern in the specified location.","While in costume, light the warding lantern.","Speak with Uphanne in front of the Adders' Nest.","Speak with Damaris at Nophica's Altar.","Speak with Miounne at the Carline Canopy.","While in costume, scare the Impresario with the spooky sparkler."],"dialogue":[{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"Back again? I thought I'd given you enough work to keep you out of our─ Ahem! Your efforts on my troupe's behalf have so impressed me that I would entrust to you the most important task of all.

This lantern here!"},{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"Yes, I am certain there is some unlit nook or cranny of this city that is in dire need of illumination─say, the falls to the north of here─and you are unquestionably the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> for the job!"},{"name":"IMPHEAD","text":"Now, procure the necessary supplies from my associate over there, and hop to it. I have more important matters to attend to! Heh heh heh..."},{"name":"IMPA","text":"One final lantern? How odd, I could have sworn that we had lit them all..."},{"name":"IMPA","text":"But who am I to question the Impresario? Very well, take this bomb digit and do with it as you will."},{"name":"IMPA","text":"Is it truly wise to be walking around without your costume like that?

Their guises are a bit <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> convincing, if you ask me. All Saints' Wake or no, I am ill pleased to see such baleful creatures skulking about the streets of our fair nation."},{"name":"UPHANNE","text":"To the Order, safeguarding Gridania and its people is paramount. I must admit that I have my reservations about engaging in such idle revelry in these trying times."},{"name":"UPHANNE","text":"But the troupe is here at the invitation of the Elder Seedseer herself, and it is not my place to question her.

That ghastly troupe was summoned by the Elder Seedseer herself? Preposterous!"},{"name":"DAMARIS","text":"Dashing through the Twelveswood dressed as ghosts? Hacking up pumpkins to serve as frivolous decorations? I shudder to think of how the elementals would react. No, this is all the Adventurers' Guild's doing.
