As she tells it, her son Valan─who you had some dealings with in the past─has once again run off with Quinfort, a would-be prophet with a penchant for the dramatic. She bids you go in search for the young man, lest he and his friend wander off too far and get themselves in trouble.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Searching the forest, you come upon Quinfort and a visibly frustrated Valan. The latter is expressing his frustration with his friend's predilection for dashing off at a moment's notice with scarcely a word of explanation when─lo and behold─Quinfort is struck with another vision, and promptly dashes off deep into the forest. With an audible sigh, Valan turns to you and asks that you join him in surveying the area for any sign of the impulsive prognosticator.","You succeed in tracking down Quinfort, who stands before a curious scene: two ratlike creatures─one old, one young─being threatened at spearpoint by a couple of Viis guards. The two introduce themselves as Qitarl Natl and Chaqurl Qhotl of the Qitari, a mouselike tribe that once served the empire of Ronka as scribes and scriveners before being driven to the depths of the forest at the time of the Flood. Having emerged from their hundred-year exile, they now seek to unearth the Qitari stelae─massive stone tablets engraved with records of their accumulated knowledge and history, and in doing so reclaim their legacy. They are accompanied by a small, squirmy creature that is the spitting image of the Great Serpent of Ronka who Quinfort so loyally serves. The serpent then dashes off with an excited “scree,” leading the Qitari duo and Quinfort alike to conclude that the divine protector is leading them to the relic they seek. Should you be so inclined, follow along and join them in the search.","You find the Qitari and their serpent standing near a sealed cave entrance. It is here, according to Qitarl Natl, that his forefathers stored away the stone tablets for safekeeping before fleeing the forest some one hundred years ago. He further elaborates that breaking the seal will require a relic of ancient Ronka─or more specifically, a stone housing immense aetherial power, and entreats your assistance in searching for one. You resolve to ponder their offer, and to speak with Qitarl again should you be inclined to cooperate.","Qitarl rejoices at your generous offer of aid, his long-held wish of reclaiming his tribe's legacy finally within reach. Quinfort, struck with another burst of possibly divine inspiration, offers his hypothesis that the striped pattern on the great serpent's body might indeed be a clue as to the location of the stone you seek. Questioning his sanity but having nowhere else to turn, you strike out in search of the ancient relic that may grant you and your newfound Qitari friends passage into the cavern.","You succeed in finding the stone and delivering it safely to Chaqurl Qhotl. Quinfort's ramblings again prove remarkably prophetic when the engraved slab sealing the cave's entrance gives way, granting passage to the grottoes and tunnels within. The Qitari explorers jump for joy, unable to contain their excitement at the discoveries that doubtless lie ahead. They resolve to call for a select group of their fellow tribesmen to assist in the excavation effort, which will be conducted on a grand scale. Should you be of a mind to aid the self-styled Stewards of Note in pursuing their life's work, they will surely welcome your continued presence at their camp in Hopl's Stopple."],"objectives":["Speak with Valan at Fanow.","Search for Quinfort at the designated location.","Speak with Chaqurl Qhotl near the Ox'Dalan Gap.","Speak with Qitarl Natl.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mine [Error] in the Blind Forest of Yx'Maja</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver [Error] to Chaqurl Qhotl</span><span class=\"alternative\">Gather [Error] in the Blind Forest of Yx'Maja</span><span class=\"alternative\">Catch [Error] at Mjrl's Regret</span></span>."],"dialogue":[{"name":"WORRYINGMOTHER","text":"Oh, hello there.

You call us an ancient and venerable tribe, and...I cannot deny that we are very much that."},{"name":"VIISGUARDA","text":"The Qitari? That is a name I have heard from my elders.

Then came that fateful day when the skies were flooded with Light. Facing certain doom, our forebears fled the forests─but not before a band of the bravest gave their lives to store away our greatest treasures for safekeeping, with the hope that one day their children's children might unearth them anew."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"These are the <span class=\"emphasis\">artifacts</span> of which my son spoke─the Qitari stelae, mighty stone monoliths engraved with the accumulated knowledge of our people in its entirety."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Of course! It is precisely as I saw it in the visions the great serpent bestowed upon me! A proud and ancient tribe of scribes and scholars! The stewards of knowledge of ancient Ronka!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"...Oho. You are most insightful, my friend. Indeed, we were once known as the Stewards of Note─a title that fittingly describes both our duties as keepers of written knowledge, and the surpassing aptitude with which we pursued the task. Our ancestors served proudly as scribes and scriveners for many a generation of Ronkan emperors."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"It is a role that came quite naturally to our people. For you see, we are not blessed with the longer lifespans of your kind. Thus, from our earliest days, we have been most meticulous about recording the happenings and learnings of our lives in precise and painstaking detail."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"The Qitari stelae─or, more specifically, the carvings and etchings that grace their surfaces─represent the summation of all the knowledge and wisdom we have acquired over the years. They represent, one might say, the collective memory of our people, passed down through the ages from generation to generation."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Long have we dreamed of returning here to search for the stones, and reclaiming our legacy. And yet! Nasty, nasty sin eaters and worse stood in our path, making the journey far too <span class=\"emphasis\">pair</span>-lious to even attempt!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Then, one day, the skies turned dark! I trembled in terror, but next thing I knew, the great serpent was hopping and squirming beside me! He told me that a path through the Ravel had been cleared, and we were free to go home at last!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Precisely. And so it was that my boy and I received the blessings of our fellow Qitari, and became the first of our kind in generations to return to this part of the Greatwood. Unfortunately, we were immediately set upon by all sorts of nasty creatures, forcing us to retreat and ponder our course of action."},{"name":"VIISGUARDA","text":"...Where we came upon you, and threatened you at spearpoint. Pray forgive us, allies of Ronka. We knew not who you were, nor all you had suffered to arrive here."},{"name":"VIISGUARDB","text":"You intend to remain here in the Greatwood to search for these...stelae of yours, was it? Worry not. We shall tell all in Fanow of you─that you are friends, and not to be harmed. And with that, we must be on our way. Go in peace."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Dear me, but that was a close one, wasn't it? I was all but certain Chaqurl and I were going to end up skewered. Were it up to me, I would have left the boy behind for his safety. But he is ever a curious one, and would hear nothing of it."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"I'm not a child anymore, Father! I'm all of three summers!"},{"name":"VALAN","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Three</span>!? Why, when I was three, I could barely walk straight!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Oho! I do not doubt that is so, good sir. But for our people─the oldest of whom would be lucky to see <span class=\"emphasis\">twenty</span> summers─Chaqurl here is almost a Qitari grown."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"...But enough about us. If I might change the subject, you know your way around the Greatwood, yes? I have reason to believe that our forefathers buried the stelae in a cavern that extends deep into the mountains near the Ox'Dalan Gap. Perhaps you might be willing to─"},{"name":"BOUSHITSUCHINOKO","text":"(-Stylish Serpent-)Scree! Scree!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Come, Father! We must follow him!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"But of course! It all makes sense now! It is the great serpent who guided you here to us, and now─together─we must heed its clarion call! Say no more, great stewards of Ronka! It would be our honor to assist you in your noble cause!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"That is most kind of you, good sir. In that case, pray allow me to oblige. Let us follow where the great one leads."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"The mere sight of the divine protector, humbling itself so as to crawl on the ground, that its loyal servants may rediscover and reclaim their proud past! Why, it nigh brings a tear to my eye!"},{"name":"VALAN","text":"Wonderful...his vision actually proved true. Now I'll never hear the end of it."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"And so we finally return to this place after one hundred years. But what awaits us here? The mere prospect stirs my heart and makes me tremble in anticipation..."},{"name":"BOUSHITSUCHINOKO","text":"Scree!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The serpent wriggles and writhes about excitedly. It appears most eager to see what lies beyond the sealed cave entrance."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Father! Could this be the place?"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Let us see, now... The mark on the cave's entrance appears to be an ancient Ronkan ward. This is promising, and yet...problematic."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Do allow me to explain. We Qitari worship Ox'Dalan, god of the dead and the world below. Our forebears no doubt believed that if they sealed away the stelae deep within the bowels of the land, Dalan Himself would watch over them and keep them safe until the day their descendants returned."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Most fascinating! Your knowledge of Ronkan tradition is impressive, indeed! However do you manage to know so much, despite your chronicles of history being lost to you for so long?"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Many ruins can be found near Rak'tika Falls, within the wood we have called home since the Flood. We have made an effort to explore and excavate them as best we could, that our Ronkan roots would not be entirely forgotten."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"A most admirable goal─and one near and dear to my own heart, as well! For you see, I am one of the Night's Blessed, who traveled to these parts after the Flood. I, too, have a deep personal interest in the beliefs and traditions of the ancient civilization that once flourished here!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"In fact, I have done extensive research looking into my <span class=\"emphasis\">own</span> ancestors, and was pleased to discover that I can trace my lineage back to none other than the great sage Dwatl himself!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"And <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> here is a true ally of Ronka. Why, as the Viis tell it, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> coming was foretold by the last emperor himself!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"The descendants of Ronka and their allies reunited across the years? Oh, joyous day! This meeting must truly be a gift from the great serpent!"},{"name":"VALAN","text":"I can vouch for <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> here─<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> is the very <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> who drove the Lightwarden from these lands. As for the descendant of the great sage what's-his-name, I'd suggest you let at least half of his ramblings go in one ear and out the other."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Could it truly be...? But yes, our hero stands before us! We watched your battle in the Ravel from the shadows. The moment you struck down that beast of Light, we knew that a new age was nigh. Oh, never have I seen such gallantry and valor!"},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"I saw the battle, too! Never have I seen such <span class=\"emphasis\">vallantry</span> and <span class=\"emphasis\">galor</span>!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"At any rate, my good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sirs and madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sirs</span></span>... I am keen to begin the excavation, but I fear it won't be so simple. The warding seal here bars our entrance, and we will have to find a way to break it if we hope to proceed."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"If what I have gleaned from my research is correct, this will require an object of immense arcane power. A relic that will speak to the seal, and convey that the Qitari have returned to claim what is ours. An object imbued with the mystical energies of the forest itself..."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Yes, an object with the glow of the Greatwood─as you always say, Father! I shall find it for you!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Your enthusiasm is admirable, Chaqurl. But let us not get ahead of ourselves. This is a perilous place, and I have no intention of seeing you get snatched up by some terrible beast."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"And so I turn to the hero of the Ravel and the son of Dwatl. My good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sirs and madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sirs</span></span>, might you know of someone who could aid us in our search?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"You can trust me. I'm <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">an [Job]</span><span class=\"alternative\">a [Job]</span></span>."},{"name":"A2","text":"I know the Greatwood like the back of my hand."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Oh, lucky day! Clearly, you are not merely a hero on the battlefield, but a <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\"> woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> of many talents indeed. We would be ever so indebted to you if we could impose upon you just this once."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"Yes, we would be most in-<span class=\"emphasis\">tedd</span>-ed, my good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span></span>! Or was it <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>? Father, I can never tell which is which!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"Enough prattling, Chaqurl. We must find a way to open this portal at once, that we might summon our fellow Stewards here and begin searching for the stelae in earnest."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"O, ally of Ronka. Qitarl Natl of the Qitari bows down and beseeches you. Will you lend us your aid and help my people reclaim our long-lost legacy? I promise you the debt will not go unpaid."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"I realize I ask much of you, and so soon after we met. Needless to say, pray take as much time as you require to consider our offer. Should you be inclined to offer your strength and wisdom to us, just say the word."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"The descendants of the proud Qitari, emerged from the shadows to reclaim their legacy after a century! Mighty stone monoliths inscribed with the wisdom of the ages! Why, I can just feel the wondrous secrets of ancient Ronka stirring me to the depths of my soul!"},{"name":"VALAN","text":"Is there anything you can't do? No wonder Master Matoya is so happy to have you around."},{"name":"CHAQURLQHOTL","text":"After the battle, when the skies went dark, I could hardly believe my eyes! After all, I'd never seen the...er...what's the opposite of day again?"},{"name":"BOUSHITSUCHINOKO","text":"Scree!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"I am happy to greet you again, my good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>.

Have you given any thought to my entreaty?"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"The ally of Ronka stands with you."},{"name":"A3","text":"The ally of Ronka has more important things to do."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"I see. Well, that is a shame, isn't it? And here I thought we were getting on so well. But I forget myself. Of course, you are free to conduct your business as you see fit. Should you ever have a change of heart, my son and I will be waiting here...patiently."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Powerfully spoken, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Truly, this shall mark a new dawn in the annals of Ronkan history! As the great sage is my witness, I say: let the Qitari rise to glory anew!"},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"We are truly in your debt, ally of Ronka. I entrust the vital task of finding an object with the glow of the Greatwood to you. As for where to begin your search..."},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Leave that to me, my long-snouted friend! Did you mayhap notice that the serpent your dear Chaqurl brought along has a rather distinctive pattern of scales on its most exquisite body? I have reason to believe that this pattern will indeed lead us to that which we seek!"},{"name":"BOUSHITSUCHINOKO","text":"Scree!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Hark unto the serpent's cry! And know that the points of light that glow amidst the stripes represent those precise spots where the aether that flows through the Greatwood is most densely concentrated!"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"Behold! Here, in the northwestern reaches of the Blind Forest of Yx'Maja─conveniently marked by this slimy little scar─we can see what is doubtless a convergence of sorts.

If the son of Dwatl says it is so, then surely it would behoove us to pay heed."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"When you return with the relic, pray let Chaqurl see it once.

As for whether whatever you find will serve our purposes, I guess we'll just have to see, won't we?"},{"name":"QUINFORT","text":"The great serpent has spoken! Yes, it is as clear to me as a clarion call from the heavens! Ancient aetheric energy will be summoned forth, and the door shall open, revealing a pathway to great secrets of the past!"},{"name":"BOUSHITSUCHINOKO","text":"Scree!

And with this, after a hundred years...we stand on the verge of reclaiming our legacy."},{"name":"QITARLNATL","text":"But our task has only begun. There will be digging─yes, much digging─and delving.
