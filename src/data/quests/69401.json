However, he believes that you will surely perish if you attempt to take it, and states that other heroes will rise to the occasion and slay Titan even if you do not. If you have the courage to press onward, journey to the nest and attempt to claim the egg.","As Landenel suspected, you were immediately attacked by the mother adamantoise when you touched the egg. It was a mighty struggle, but in the end you survived. You may now claim your prize.","The adamantoise egg is now yours. Return to Camp Tranquil and present it to Landenel.","Landenel is impressed by your reckless bravery. After taking the egg on behalf of Wheiskaet, he bids you journey to Forgotten Springs in southern Thanalan and speak with a man named U'odh Nunh, who will help you obtain the second ingredient.","Contrary to what Landenel said, U'odh Nunh has no intention of aiding you in your quest.
