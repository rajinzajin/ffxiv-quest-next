Currently, the guild has need of morbol vines, which will be used to craft stronger ropes for the miners who scale the mountains of Mor Dhona. Travel to the Tangle and slay a resident morbol for its feelers.","You have obtained an exceptionally thick morbol vine. Return it to Fyrbryda before another miner snaps his neck. Also, do not forget to submit the disposal unit component materials to the forgewife for inspection.","Fyrbryda has granted you access to the Diamond Forge's crafting facilities.
