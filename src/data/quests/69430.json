As per the convoluted instructions you have received from the trio of Skysteel engineers, you make a mental note to procure the required materials using the tool in question, trade them to Denys for pot upon pot of even gooier gobbiegoo, then deliver the lot to Nimie along with your tool.<br><br>※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Thanks to your dedication and devotion─as well as the tireless efforts of your friends at the Skysteel Manufactory, your tool now sings with heretofore-inconceivable power. Taking it in hand with satisfaction, you feel certain that your fellow adventurers who now toil to rebuild Ishgard will likewise revel in the opportunity to wield these marvels of technology and take their already-potent crafting and gathering skills to new heights. You set off with naught left to do but anticipate the day that your mechanically minded friends are able to glean the knowledge and know-how necessary to reach still loftier goals."],"objectives":["With <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Saw</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Cross-pein Hammer</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Raising Hammer</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Lapidary Hammer</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Round Knife</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Needle</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Alembic</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Frypan</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Pickaxe</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Hatchet</span><span class=\"alternative\">Augmented Dragonsung Fishing Rod</span></span> in your inventory or Armoury Chest, deliver <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">105</span> Highly Viscous Carpenter's Gobbiegoo</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">105</span> Highly Viscous Blacksmith's Gobbiegoo</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">105</span> Highly Viscous Armorer's Gobbiegoo</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">105</span> Highly Viscous Goldsmith's Gobbiegoo</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">105</span> Highly Viscous Leatherworker's Gobbiegoo</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">105</span> Highly Viscous Weaver's Gobbiegoo</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">105</span> Highly Viscous Alchemist's Gobbiegoo</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">105</span> Highly Viscous Culinarian's Gobbiegoo</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">60</span> Highly Viscous Miner's Gobbiegoo and</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">60</span> Highly Viscous Botanist's Gobbiegoo and</span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">7</span> Highly Viscous Fisher's Gobbiegoo</span></span><span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\"> <span class=\"highlight\">200</span> Oddly Specific Primordial Asphaltum</span><span class=\"alternative\"> <span class=\"highlight\">200</span> Oddly Specific Primordial Resin</span></span> to Nimie."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Please note that upon completing the quest “The Tools of Tomorrow,” you will receive a skysung tool for your current class of [Job]."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you do?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Undertake this quest as another class."},{"name":"A2","text":"Undertake this quest as <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">an [Job]</span><span class=\"alternative\">a [Job]</span></span>."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Be advised that once you have begun this quest, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted it."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Please ensure that you have changed to your desired class before speaking with Nimie."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In order to receive the quest “The Tools of Tomorrow,” you must have [Error] equipped or in your inventory."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have already received [Error].

A name worthy of its impressive new state, I am certain you will agree."},{"name":"DENYSE","text":"Ah! Speaking of which─I whipped up some sample replica tools based upon our work thus far.

Besides, she's even offered to donate a portion of the profits to our research. It's a win-win situation."},{"name":"DENYSE","text":"...Also, it's an offer we contractually can't refuse. So spread the word, and make sure to stop by and purchase some quality dragonsung tool replicas at your earliest convenience!"},{"name":"NIMIE","text":"My apologies for the delay! As Denys may have mentioned, the process this time around required considerable attention to detail. But I am proud to inform you that the work is complete, and I didn't even burn my eyebrows off!"},{"name":"NIMIE","text":"Ah...the satisfaction of a job well done. A satisfaction you too can enjoy, once I deign to hand over your tool."},{"name":"NIMIE","text":"Behold: your skysung tool! She's a beauty, if I do say so myself.
