To that end, you must solve a riddle hidden in an encoded message, which was written by the famed explorer Winebaud. Valiant Hart also makes mention of a man named Yayaroku, who may be able to offer assistance.","Your investigation leads you to a disciple of Winebaud, who entrusts you with the journal of his deceased master. Return to the statue of the Silent King and share your findings with Valiant Hart.","In your absence, Valiant Hart has made further progress in deciphering the encoded message. However, his efforts have yielded yet another riddle, one which you must solve if you wish to locate the treasure you seek.","Through methods mysterious and unknown, you receive a message from the late Winebaud. He praises your efforts to seek out the truth and shares with you a verse of poetry for reasons unknown. Valiant Hart will doubtless wish to hear of these developments.","Valiant Hart is pleased with your progress, but disappointed that Winebaud did not provide any clues as to the whereabouts of Lalafuto III's secret treasure. Having no other leads, he bids you solve the latest riddle he has deciphered.","Once again, the late Winebaud imparts to you a verse of poetry as a reward, albeit one of questionable value. Report your success to Valiant Hart at the statue of the Silent King.","Valiant Hart is bemused by the increasing complexity of Winebaud's riddles, as well as his penchant for rewarding you with poetic verses. Brushing aside that curiosity for the time being, he directs you to his most recent translation, which contains yet another riddle.","Your jewelry triggers an enchantment woven into Winebaud's engravings, allowing you to receive another message from the late explorer. To your chagrin, it contains little more than another verse of poetry. Valiant Hart does not appear to have seen the message, so perhaps you should tell him what you witnessed.","Bemoaning Winebaud's refusal to offer clear and concise directions, Valiant Hart tells you he has finished deciphering the encoded message. However, unlike previous sections, this one does not appear to contain a riddle. But where is the treasure of Lalafuto III, and what must be done to claim it?","With the aid of your copper gorget, you lay claim to the secret treasure purported to be worth one hundred million gil. Valiant Hart snatches it from your hand, his eyes wild with greed, but his expression soon changes to one of disbelief. The “treasure” Winebaud spoke of was a collection of love poems written by Lalafuto III to his paramour, with whom the sultan wished to elope. His quest for phenomenal wealth having ended in utter failure, Valiant Hart cries out to the heavens in rage, cursing the explorer who valued true love above all else."],"objectives":["Solve the explorer's riddle.","Speak with Valiant Hart.","Solve the explorer's riddle.","Speak with Valiant Hart.","Solve the explorer's riddle.","Speak with Valiant Hart.","Solve the explorer's riddle.","Speak with Valiant Hart.","Claim the treasure of Lalafuto III."],"dialogue":[{"name":"VALLIANTHART","text":"Elements?
