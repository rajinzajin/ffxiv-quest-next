For the first step, seek out an imperial patrol outside Castrum Centri, and alert them to the presence of enemy forces. Remember to greet your superiors with an /imperialsalute.","You have alerted the imperial patrol to the enemy's presence. As Glaumunt forewarned, however, the soldiers seem hesitant to venture far beyond the sight of the castrum's walls. You will need to lure them out by using the imperial smoke signal at the specified location.","You have succeeded in acquiring a magitek reaper, though some repairs will be required before it can be put to use. Cid bids you meet him back at his workshop in Revenant's Toll. Speak with Slafborn at the front door to be admitted.","You arrive at Cid's workshop to find that Biggs and Wedge have already set about repairing the magitek reaper.

You'll be pleased to hear I ain't been idle myself. It took me long enough, but I've finally hatched a plan to get us a suit o' magitek armor."},{"name":"GLAUMUNT","text":"Now, from what I've seen, Castrum Centri deploys a reaper for most of its patrols."},{"name":"GLAUMUNT","text":"Trouble is, the patrols 'emselves are <span class=\"emphasis\">irregular</span>─meanin' random routes an' random deployments─an' hardly any of 'em come anywhere near Revenant's Toll."},{"name":"GLAUMUNT","text":"So, hopin' to coax the imperials out o' their shells, I took the liberty o' feedin' 'em a bit o' the old false intelligence─told 'em insurgents had designs on their stronghold."},{"name":"GLAUMUNT","text":"'Tain't far from the truth, now I come to think of it. Anyroad, we should start seein' more patrols than we have up till now."},{"name":"GLAUMUNT","text":"What you need to do is approach one o' these patrols, dressed up in your shiny tin suit, an' alert 'em to the enemy's presence."},{"name":"GLAUMUNT","text":"Havin' done that, you'll want to lure 'em as near to Revenant's Toll as you can. Like as not, though, they'll be wary o' venturin' far from their own walls."},{"name":"GLAUMUNT","text":"If they <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> need a bit of extra encouragement, use this smoke signal here, filched fresh from an imperial scout. They'll come runnin' when they see that. An' when the cavalry arrives, you hit 'em hard an' make off with their reaper─simple as that."},{"name":"GLAUMUNT","text":"If I ain't mistaken, there's a patrol sweepin' the perimeter right now, so run along, eh? Oh, an' don't forget to <span class=\"highlight\">salute</span>!"},{"name":"NPCA","text":"My wife bore me a son not long after I was sent here. I can't wait to go home and meet him."},{"name":"NPCB","text":"Did you hear about these insurgents? Apparently, they've got their eye on the castrum. Personally, I'd like to see them try to take it. It'd serve to lift the tedium."},{"name":"NPCC","text":"Get moving, you lot! The quicker we march, the sooner this will be over!"},{"name":"NPCD","text":"All the coin I make doing this goes to the wife in the country. If it turns out she's been squandering it on fancy clothes and gewgaws, I will <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> be amused."},{"name":"NPCE","text":"They say it's our duty to bring civilization to these lands, but what if these lands don't want civilizing?"},{"name":"NPCF","text":"From another patrol, are you? When next you see your commanding officer, tell him that he leads a sloppy unit. If any of my lot forgot to salute a superior officer, they would be on their arse faster than you can say “latrine duty.”"},{"name":"NPCF","text":"One of our covert operatives, I take it? In or out of uniform, you would do well to remember your courtesies."},{"name":"NPCF","text":"Carry on, soldier.<br>...Hm? Insurgents gathering to the east, you say?"},{"name":"NPCF","text":"One of our covert operatives, are you? Carry on, soldier.<br>...Hm? Insurgents gathering to the east, you say?"},{"name":"NPCF","text":"Judging by your description, they are well beyond the perimeter...but I will not have it said that I was remiss. You, return to the scene and keep an eye on those insurgents. Should aught go awry, use your smoke signal to call us."},{"name":"NPCF","text":"Give me strength... If that was your idea of a salute, you can wave good-bye to that promotion right now."},{"name":"NPCF","text":"Return to the scene and keep an eye on those insurgents. Should aught go awry, use your smoke signal to call us."},{"name":"NPCA","text":"One of our informers, I take it? &lt;sigh&gt; Do you have any idea what will happen if you're seen with us? The insurgents will have your head!"},{"name":"NPCB","text":"What do you want?"},{"name":"NPCC","text":"You have no business being here!

Not wishing to look a gift chocobo in the beak, it does seem rather the worse for wear, doesn't it?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Biggs, Wedge─what's your honest assessment?"},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"Weeell...there's the fact that she's smoking, of course... But looking past that, I'd say she was structurally sound."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"Hmmm...I don't like the way these legs are buckled. I hate to say this, but the servomechanism may be damaged."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"Eh? But aren't those things protected by ilm-thick armor plate?"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"They are, yes... It's odd─the casing doesn't seem to have taken a blow. I suspect we're dealing with a faulty part."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"Well, whatever it is we're dealing with, we're not resting till it's fixed! Not one wink of sleep─you got that, Wedge?"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"Oh... &lt;mumble&gt; &lt;mumble&gt; ...ing cart chocobo."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"I heard that!"},{"name":"CID","text":"A hall has been set aside for our use in Revenant's Toll."},{"name":"CID","text":"That's where we'll carry out the repairs. Look for us there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"CID","text":"We've now had time to take a closer look at the reaper. Our preliminary diagnosis was correct─she's structurally sound, but her servomechanism is faulty."},{"name":"CID","text":"You needn't worry, though─Biggs and Wedge will see her restored to her former glory in no time at all. Give those two something to mend, and they will think of naught else till the job's done.
