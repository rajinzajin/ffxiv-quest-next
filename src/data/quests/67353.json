Despite the bond you have formed with him, he now wonders if you would have slain him had you met under different circumstances. Do what you can to /soothe him and cast aside his fearful thoughts.","While Kal Myhk accepts the reality of his brother's near-fatal encounter, you have helped him understand that not all men are evil. No longer distracted by burdens of fear and doubt, he asks for your help in finding a way to heal his brother. He suggests speaking with his mother, Gullinkambi, in the tower of Anyx Trine.","You speak with Gullinkambi hoping to find a method for rehabilitating dragons. She tells you that dragons are not wont to interfere in the healing process. Ohl Ahs was warned not to venture near Ishgard, and he will either recover from sleep or remain forever in the halls of Mourn. However, she recalls a man who once labored to create medicine capable of healing dragons. If you are intent on healing Ohl Ahs with the medicines of man, she bids you find his research. She believes they may be in the remnants of his home somewhere in the Sohm Al foothills. Speak with Kal Myhk and discuss your next course of action.","Kal Myhk believes he has seen the hovel of rocks she spoke of. Meet with him outside on the path up the mountain.","You find Kal Myhk outside where the path splits in opposite directions. He urges you upward, and moves ahead. Follow the path upward and search for Kal Myhk.","You find Kal Myhk further up the mountainside, and he says you are on the right track. Continue following Kal Myhk up the path.","Kal Myhk tells you to climb down the mountainside to a new path. Make your way down and continue following him.","You find Kal Myhk standing before the remains of the house from his mother's story. Search the building for signs of the research.","You find a tablet amidst the rubble. The letters are faded, but it describes the work of an Elezen healer. Show Kal Myhk what you found.","You show the begrimed tablet to Kal Myhk, and he is pleased to be one step closer to helping his brother. Return to Anyx Trine and show the tablet to Gullinkambi.","You present the tablet to Gullinkambi, and after briefly examining it, she confirms you have found the research on healing dragons. With the tablet in hand, you at last have the knowledge needed to heal Kal Myhk's brother."],"objectives":["/soothe Kal Myhk.","Speak with Gullinkambi.","Speak with Kal Myhk.","Meet Kal Myhk on the mountain path.","Follow Kal Myhk up the mountain.","Follow Kal Myhk further up the mountain.","Follow Kal Myhk down the mountain.","Search for the research on healing dragons.","Show the begrimed tablet to Kal Myhk.","Take the begrimed tablet to Gullinkambi."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KALMYHK","text":"Tell me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>...what would have happened had we met under different circumstances?
