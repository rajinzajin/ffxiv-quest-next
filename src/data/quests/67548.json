The astrologian accepts you with open arms and proceeds to give you your first astrology-related assignment─inquiring with other Athenaeum students on the whereabouts of an important visitant from Sharlayan.","The brains of the Athenaeum students have been picked clean. Inform Jannequinard of your findings.","Jannequinard believes Forlemort of the Observatorium may be privy to information regarding the whereabouts of the missing Sharlayan party, and is resolved to make the journey south into the Coerthas central highlands to ask the chief astrologian himself. Jannequinard has requested that you meet him at the astroscope so that he will not have to entreat Forlemort alone.","A series of unpredictable circumstances forced the Sharlayan party to make a long and dangerous detour through the Black Shroud. If Chief Astrologian Forlemort's information is to be believed, the party lingers currently somewhere in the vicinity of Quarrymill. Jannequinard's retainer Quimperain is already en route to the hamlet. Join him in the search.","While Quimperain thanks you for your assistance in helping his master, he ever-so-subtly advises you against continuing your studies in astrology. Follow Quimperain into Snakemolt to commence your search for the Sharlayan party.","Quimperain locates the party, only to find that they have been beset by bandits. Elder astrologian Mace is dragged off at knifepoint by the ruffians, but not before he inconspicuously tosses his soul crystal in the loam for you to find. Mace's granddaughter claims that this turn of events was foretold in the stars, and that it is, and always has been, your fate to take up the crystal.<br><br>※The next astrologian job quest will be available from Leveva upon equipping the Soul of the Astrologian."],"objectives":["Speak with Jannequinard.","Inquire with other astrologians at the Athenaeum.","Speak with Jannequinard.","Speak with Jannequinard at the Observatorium.","Speak with Quimperain in Quarrymill.","Speak with Quimperain in Snakemolt."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Dammy"},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"Now, where to begin!?

Myself, I have been a student of the astromantic arts for more summers than I can count, and I still oft misread the signs shown to me in the skies.

The colony that once thrived in the Dravanian hinterlands."},{"name":"JANNEQUINARD","text":"I can recall my time there like it was but yesterday. The first six moons, I was not even allowed to touch the Deck of Sixty, let alone conduct a reading with the major arcana.
