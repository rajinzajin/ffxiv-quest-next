In her vision, she saw the spriggan depart Gridania, and reappear amid the dusty lanes of Ul'dah. Jihli bids you follow him there, and speak with Nonotta, her faithful assistant based near the Ruby Road Exchange, to learn of the latest developments.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","Nonotta confirms that the auspicious spriggan has made its entrance to Ul'dah, but to the Dreamer's alarm, the spriggan did not come alone: villainous roughnecks calling themselves the “Shellshockers” have also made their way into the city, and are hunting the creature down to who knows what nefarious end. She bids you aid in the spriggan's escape, recommending you first have the local sylphic sorceress disguise you in spriggan form, to avoid attracting the brigands' unwelcome attentions.","The sylphic sorceress gladly transfigures you, and presents you with a clouding scalebomb to aid in the auspicious spriggan's escape. Search the streets around the Quicksand, the spriggan's last known location, and if you should come across a Shellshocker, present him with the diverting gift.<br><br>※If the transfiguration should fade, speak with the sylphic sorceress again to be changed back into spriggan form.","You find the spriggan cornered by a pair of infamous Shellshockers, and despite the leader's grumblings, you press your present into his hands. In the ensuing chaos, the spriggan bolts from their clutches. Return to the Ruby Road Exchange to report your successful rescue effort to Nonotta.","Nonotta is glad to hear of the auspicious spriggan's escape, but fears the Shellshockers will not cease their wicked hunt until the creature has fled the confines of the city. She bids you transform into spriggan form once more, so that you might aid the auspicious spriggan's flight without attracting the ruffians' ire.","The sylphic sorceress magicks you into furry form, and hands you another clouding scalebomb to distract the evil Shellshockers. The auspicious spriggan was seen racing towards the Gate of the Sultana, but chances are the bandits have got there first. Head to the gate, and ensure the auspicious spriggan evades their greedy clutches.<br><br>※If the transfiguration should fade, speak with the sylphic sorceress again to be changed back into spriggan form.","You find the auspicious spriggan cornered once again, this time by a trio of salivating Shellshockers. Their leader waves you away, but your insistence pays off─he agrees to accept the booby-trapped gift. With his would-be captors incapacitated by a fit of coughing, the spriggan makes a break for the gates, and flees into the wide blue yonder. Return to Nonotta, and inform her of the spriggan's safe escape.","Nonotta is relieved to hear of the spriggan's escape, and rejoices in the fact that all is proceeding as Jihli's vision predicted. But just as she is about to explain the next stage of the prophecy, a Shellshocker approaches, and speaks to her with suspicious familiarity. Nonotta tries to gloss over the unusual exchange, but the air remains heavy with lingering doubt: could the day's commotions have all been a ruse, orchestrated by Nonotta herself? And if so, to what end...?"],"objectives":["Speak with Nonotta in Ul'dah.","Speak with the sylphic sorceress in Ul'dah.","While transfigured, give the clouding scalebomb to the Shellshocker.","Report to Nonotta.","Speak with the sylphic sorceress again.","While transfigured, give the clouding scalebomb to the Shellshocker.","Report to Nonotta again."],"dialogue":[{"name":"JIHLIALIAPOH","text":"Are you ready to fulfill the next step of the prophecy, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?

We must hasten to his rescue, lest the prophecy be torn to tatters, and the wondrous treasure lost for all eternity!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"Did Jihli mention the auspicious spriggan to you? The creature appeared to her in a prophetic vision─she saw it travel across Eorzea with a band of revelers in its wake, leading them to a great reward. First she saw it in Gridania, then it moved to Ul'dah...and as sure as eggs is eggs, here it moved!"},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"However, there was another element to her vision─a lurking menace, hidden in the sands─and sure enough, the very same has come to pass! A band of ruffians have made ingress to the city, and are hunting down the spriggan to Thal knows what sinister end."},{"name":"NONOTTA","text":"They call themselves the Shellshockers... A name that inspires revulsion in any enthusiast of Hatching–tide, wouldn't you agree?

They shan't be messing with spriggans again any time soon! Though it puzzles me what a band of roughnecks like them would want with a spriggan in the first place.
