Per Shigure's instructions, you and the others are to go on ahead and wait for him to join you at the Ruby Price, the gateway to that watery expanse.","After sparing a moment to take in the garish garments Shigure has opted to wear, Hildibrand bids the Wolf Burglar explain why he first sought to claim the Soboro Sukehiro in the first place, prompting the thief to divulge a surprisingly moving backstory filled with tragedy and pathos, in which he explains that the sword once belonged to his adoptive father, a humble samurai, who was deceived by and became indebted to Akebono. Having no recourse, he pledged his blade as collateral and began slaving day and night to repay the vast sum of money he owed. Alas, having grown weaker over the years, he was in no condition to do so, and so died. Deprived once more of a family, his Lupin charge vowed to revenge himself upon the diabolical merchant, traveling to his native Yanxia for several years to learn the arts of the shinobi before returning to Kugane and becoming a notorious thief...but such stories of past wrongs have little bearing on the here and now. To Sakazuki the party will first go, and there question the resident Confederates in the hopes that one will have seen Yojimbo.","Yojimbo's distinct appearance makes him rather easy to describe to others. Alas, the scout with whom you first speak has no recollection of a traveler matching his description. Onwards and upwards.","The second scout you question has indeed seen a man matching Yojimbo's description─one in the company of a canine, in fact, prompting Hildibrand to summon the others and make haste for the beach where last they were spotted. Sure enough, you are soon reunited with Daigoro, whose initial reluctance to approach is quickly dispelled by the sight of a shiny koban. The good dog soon leads you to his master a short distance away, currently deliberating how best to breach the Red Kojin sanctuary and seize the Ame-no-Murakumo. When confronted by you and your entourage, he grows belligerent and refuses to hand over the Soboro Sukehiro, but before violence erupts, Hildibrand somehow manages to peacefully resolve the conflict by giving Daigoro a furious belly rub. A beaten Yojimbo surrenders the blade to the inspector, who in turn surrenders it to the Wolf Burglar, albeit unintentionally, after stepping on the dog's tail and paying dearly for his carelessness. The chaotic situation further deteriorates when the sudden appearance of the Sekiseigumi drives both Yojimbo and the Wolf Burglar to flee─the latter still clutching the Soboro Sukehiro. His deception laid bare, Shigure struggles to defend his reasons for freeing the thief from his prison, but alas, has no choice but to return to Kugane and answer for his own crimes...","Inspector Hildibrand knows that something must be done to save Shigure from his current predicament. However, he also knows that a beach in the Ruby Sea is no place to deliberate your next course of action, and so he bids you all return to Kugane forthwith.","The inspector's keen inspector's sense tells him plainly that matters are coming to a head. If the Wolf Burglar is to be believed, then the merchant Akebono is the true villain at the heart of these troubles who is most deserving of a comeuppance. Should his crimes be exposed, then Shigure, as well as the Wolf Burglar, are sure to be exonerated. To that end, the inspector charges off into the streets, presumably about a new investigation. Whether or not it will be even remotely successful, only time will tell..."],"objectives":["Speak with Hildibrand in the Ruby Sea.","Question the pirates of Sakazuki.","Speak with Hildibrand.","Speak with Hildibrand in Kugane."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"All set for another trip into the glittering westward expanse?

I can't wait to see what he shows up in next!"},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"I do wonder, though, how much that blade would actually fetch on the market if sold... Hm? Don't give me that look!

I thought you were someone else at first!"},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"Well, since it was suggested that I should wear something other than the garments of a Sekiseigumi for a time, I paid a visit to Kogane Dori and purchased something completely unlike my usual attire..."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"It's quite the change, but very much for the better, if I do say so myself!"},{"name":"NASHUMHAKARACCA","text":"I didn't realize you could be so fashionable!"},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"F-Fashionable? Please, Nashu! You give me too much credit!"},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"I'll say. That getup with those zori? I don't see that becoming a trend..."},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"Not that it matters. We didn't come here to mess about, eh? We've got a collector to catch. Assuming he's after the Ame-no-Murakumo, then we've got to get to the Isle of Zekki. Any ideas?"},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"By air or by underwater passage, eh? Bit more tricky than I thought..."},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"Without the blessing of the Kojin, the latter seems almost impossible. What about that bird of yours? Montaro, was it?"},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"After what the inspector did to him? Hah! He'll be keeping a wide berth, I reckon─assuming he's even fit to fly."},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"It was a somewhat traumatic experience for all involved, aye..."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Forgive me my bluntness, my wolfish compatriot, but it occurs to me that we have yet to hear your motives for attempting to steal the Soboro Sukehiro from Master Akebono. Did not Koju say that selling such a blade would be extraordinarily difficult?"},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"...It's not stealing to take back what was stolen. That black-hearted bastard Akebono prised it from the hands of its rightful owner."},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"He was a humble samurai who lived a humble life devoid of most luxuries. A righteous man who'd never turn his back on those in need─certainly not a young Lupin boy who'd fled Doma during the occupation. The two lived as father and son, with few comforts save each other's company..."},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"And then one day a merchant came calling, asking after the samurai's sword. Asking him to part with his one prized possession. But a sword is a samurai's soul, and he'd sooner die than sell it, even for a fortune."},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"But the merchant, he's not the sort to go quietly into the night. He changes tack and worms his way into the samurai's affairs. Small sums at first, but bigger, then bigger... Before he knows it, the samurai owes the merchant a veritable mountain of coin! And so he pledges his blade as collateral..."},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"The samurai worked day and night to reclaim his honor. But while strong in spirit, he was weak in body. He fell sick, and soon after passed away, leaving his Lupin charge alone in this unjust world..."},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"All this time, you...you were only..."},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"He left Kugane for a time and returned years later from Yanxia, having learned the ways of the shinobi that he might honor his adoptive father by helping others as he had helped him as a child..."},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"A chivalrous guise for a personal vendetta, perhaps. More than anything, he yearned to reclaim the samurai's sword, the last surviving memento of their time together, that he might wear it with pride..."},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"All this time, Master Akebono was your main objective. When you broke into his shop in the Rakuza District, you were searching for the Soboro Sukehiro..."},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"You kept a close eye on him, even as you continued to target other disreputable merchants, that you might drive him to take additional measures to protect the sword, knowing that in so doing, he would eventually reveal its location..."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Then it is settled! The Soboro Sukehiro must be returned to its rightful owner!"},{"name":"NASHUMHAKARACCA","text":"Hey, um... If it's so hard for people to reach the Isle of Zekki, how was Yojimbo planning to get there?"},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"That I do not know, but regardless, if he was headed there, someone must have noted his passing..."},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"I say we question the pirates of Sakazuki and see if any have observed a traveler resembling Yojimbo of late."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"We are of the same mind, Shigure!

After you!"},{"name":"NASHUMHAKARACCA","text":"Honestly, I think he looks better in his new outfit than the Sekiseigumi one!"},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"Who could've guessed that the Wolf Burglar would have such a tragic backstory. Maybe I misjudged him..."},{"name":"KUGANEWOLFBURGLAR","text":"...If it's about what I said earlier, forget it.

Had a dog with him, too."},{"name":"WATCHMANA03151","text":"Sure enough, he had a mind to head to the Isle of Zekki. Couldn't imagine why, what with the Red being as unwelcoming as they are, and there being no place to dock a boat. I told him as much, but he shrugged it off and went on his merry way."},{"name":"WATCHMANA03151","text":"Come to think of it, did I see that dog of his not long ago? On the beach below, wandering about, aye. I hope he didn't abandon him..."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"You have been tremendously helpful! A thousand thanks to you!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Surely the canine in question is Daigoro!

Inspector Hildibrand and I, we..."},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"In order to track down Yojimbo and the Soboro Sukehiro, we needed to enlist the assistance of the Wolf Burglar.
