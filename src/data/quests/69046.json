You will need to read the text carefully and decipher the clues to determine your next course of action."},{"name":"DRERY","text":"If you've got a moment, let me tell you about a friend of mine. She was a hard worker, but her real passion was for riddles, head-scratchers, and the like. Until she met her end at the hands of a right horrible sin eater. Phronesis, I think they called it."},{"name":"DRERY","text":"Anyway, like a lot of miners, my friend kept a will. But she couldn't write a nice, simple one the same as everyone else, oh no."},{"name":"DRERY","text":"It said that she'd buried something and that if we wanted to find it, we'd have to solve a conundrum. Trouble is, none of us can work it out. But I thought someone like you, with an outsider's perspective, might see something we hadn't."},{"name":"DRERY","text":"It goes like this:"},{"name":"DRERY","text":"\"On road leading afar, follow to the third star,<br>Fear not the fall, look to the Wall,<br>At the first dry giant's heel, the brave wanderer must kneel.\""},{"name":"DRERY","text":"I can't make head nor tail of it, to be honest. Still, we're dying to know what she's buried, so if you have any luck, be sure to tell us. Oh, and I wrote down the riddle, in case you forget."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Use Drery's note to read the riddle again."},{"name":"DRERY","text":"\"On road leading afar, follow to the third star,<br>Fear not the fall, look to the Wall,<br>At the first dry giant's heel, the brave wanderer must kneel.\""},{"name":"DRERY","text":"Not the sort of thing most folk would write as their last will and testament, I'm sure you'll agree."},{"name":"MEMO03510","text":"\"On road leading afar, follow to the third star,<br>Fear not the fall, look to the Wall,<br>At the first dry giant's heel, the brave wanderer must kneel.\""},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You discover a small chest buried beneath the sand!"},{"name":"DRERY","text":"I can't believe you found it!"},{"name":"DRERY","text":"Let's see what's inside..."},{"name":"DRERY","text":"Coins, rings, even an expensive-looking pocket knife. This must be what she raked in from all those card games!"},{"name":"DRERY","text":"Wait, there's a letter. “This is for Twine,” is all it says."},{"name":"DRERY","text":"Come to think of it, I knew she made a killing on the cards, but I never saw her spending much of her winnings. Seems she was putting them away to give back to the town after her death, almost like she knew it was coming."},{"name":"DRERY","text":"Always was a mystery, that one. It's funny, I never realized how much I miss her until now. Not only have you solved the riddle, but you've shown me what sort of person she really was. You have my thanks."}],"reward":{"gil":832,"items":[{"num":2,"id":27866}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}],"quests":[69149]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1027925","obj":{"i":1027925,"n":"Drery","l":2955,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"27866","obj":{"i":27866,"n":"Sausage Links","l":409,"c":24365,"t":46,"p":3595}},{"type":"quest","id":"69149","obj":{"i":69149,"n":"On Track","g":8,"l":"Amh Araeng","s":720}}]}
