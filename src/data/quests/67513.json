He assures you that this time, they will not get lost along the way. Return to Mogule at Moghome to make sure that Kupli Kuki is as good as his word.","Mogule, Kupli Kuki, and the other Twelveswood moogles meet at last, with happy pom-poms all around. When Kupli Kuki presents his offering of kupo nuts to Mogule, they make a surprising discovery: they are exactly the same kupo nuts as the ones that are grown in Moghome. The moogles have more in common than they thought, and decide to go ask Chieftain Moglin for any information he might have that would shed light on this uncommon coincidence.","Chieftain Moglin regales you and the others with the tale of Moghome's ancestors, who were said to have descended to the surface after a disaster destroyed their once spacious home. Afterwards, Kupli Kuki relates a similar story that tells of moogles that left for the surface after the gods in the heavens started squabbling. The moogles surmise that these two stories must be telling the same occurrence in different ways, and are overjoyed to find that once the moogles of the sky and surface lived happily together. They are eager to deepen their bonds even further─be ready to get involved in all kinds of moogle mayhem."],"objectives":["Speak with Mogule at Moghome.","Speak with Moglin."],"dialogue":[{"name":"FORRESTMOG0201974","text":"Now that everyone's here, we can finally go to Moghome, kupo!
