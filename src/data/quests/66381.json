In the meantime, he asks that you deliver a bottle of his own original wine to Drest, a man who saved his life several years ago. Though he does not know exactly where Drest now lives, he does know that the man sometimes works at the Raincatcher Gully docks. Speak with Rhitskylt and see what he knows of Drest.","Rhitskylt knows little of Drest, and is more than happy to keep it that way. However, he does know that Drest lives alone at the Severed String, which lies far to the southwest of the docks. Traverse the jungle and deliver Shamani Lohmani's wine to the hermit.","You find Drest living alone in a squalid shack. Though he accepts your gift of wine, he does so with great trepidation.
