Never one to pass up the opportunity to share his stories, he offers to show you around and regale you with tales of Ishgard's history. He asks you to meet him at Saint Reinette's Forum if you wish to hear more.","You meet up with the elderly Elezen, who proceeds to tell you of the legendary dragoon Saint Reinette for which the Arc of the Humble was named. For his next story, he asks you to speak with him at Saint Valeroyant's Forum.","The elderly Elezen tells you of Saint Valeroyant and the Azure Dragoons, those chosen by the Eye to lead the nation's dragoons into battle. Though the statue before you was erected in his image, it has been damaged much like other sections of Foundation. Despite the despoilment, however, the elderly Elezen is not disheartened by what has befallen Ishgard. He has no more stories to tell you, but suggests you speak with Outreguerlain at Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral should your thirst for knowledge remain unquenched.","Outreguerlain greets you warmly and speaks with you of the patron saints of Ishgard for which many places are named. Though there is much of Ishgard you do not yet know, he asks for your understanding that it is through their faith that the people of Ishgard have stood united in their struggle against the Horde."],"objectives":["Speak with the Fury-fearing Elezen at Saint Reinette's Forum.","Speak with the Fury-fearing Elezen at Saint Valeroyant's Forum.","Speak with Outreguerlain at Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral."],"dialogue":[{"name":"PIOUSOLDMAN01726","text":"Hmmm... I take it by your garb you are not from here, am I right? The sights of our city must be quite the spectacle. It is a place rich with history─a story for every brick that paves our streets or frames our hearths and homes."},{"name":"PIOUSOLDMAN01726","text":"There is much to learn of Ishgard, and I suppose I can teach you a thing or two. If you care to listen to this old man's tales, pray meet me at Saint Reinette's Forum."},{"name":"PIOUSOLDMAN01726","text":"Ah, so you've come to partake of my company, eh?

After much searching, she confronted the beast, and that would be the last time she wielded a lance.<br><br>Upon exacting her revenge, they say she cast it aside on the ground where the dragon was felled, taking up the cloth in its place."},{"name":"PIOUSOLDMAN01726","text":"From then on, she devoted her life to uplifting the poor and downtrodden."},{"name":"PIOUSOLDMAN01726","text":"I daresay there has never been a man or woman so selfless as she in our history. And so the Arc of the Humble was constructed, that we should never forget her sacrifices."},{"name":"PIOUSOLDMAN01726","text":"It's perhaps worth mentioning that we of Ishgard take great pride in the works of masonry adorning our streets.

Quite remarkable, wouldn't you agree?
