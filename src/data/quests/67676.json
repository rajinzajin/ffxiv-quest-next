Unfortunately, they have run out of time, for the king and his minions have begun to venture inland. After requesting that you lend the Rangers your strength on the battlefield, the grand chaperone bids you meet them at Hidden Falls so that together you might organize a strategy to defeat the Bombard King before any harm comes to the people.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You rendezvous with the Go Go Posing Rangers, who are one member short. As you wait for the Red Ranger to arrive, the other two explain they have yet to perfect the Firefall Battle Formation because their missing comrade often overthinks the steps, causing him to fall out of sync. Luckily, the Yellow and Black Rangers believe they may have found a way to combat this problem through meditation, and request that you hold off the Bombards that have appeared on the shores long enough for them to walk him through the process. Participate in the FATE “In Deep Water” and help the Rangers defeat the Bombard King.<br><br>※Participate in the FATE “In Deep Water” followed by the FATE “Trial by Fire” to defeat the Bombard King.","As you beat back the last of the burgeoning Bombards with your elbst, you turn to see the Go Go Posing Rangers fall into Firefall Battle Formation and fell the Bombard King. They rush off, turning once to salute you before continuing on their way to Hidden Falls.","The Yellow and Black Rangers are waiting by the waterfall for you in the aftermath of the battle. True to form, the Red Ranger joins you all a short while later, still refusing to remove his mask. The other two, however, eventually goad him into revealing his identity, and hiding beneath the red mask, is the face of none other than Haermaga. Having learned a valuable lesson in both teamwork and the meaning of friendship, he tells you that he believes this will be the start of a long and successful career of fighting evil for him and his two comrades."],"objectives":["Rendezvous with the Go Go Posing Rangers at Hidden Falls.","Complete the FATEs “In Deep Water” and “Trial by Fire” in Costa del Sol.","Speak with the Yellow Ranger."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, thanks to you, the Go Go Posing Rangers' performance has improved dramatically. Every one of them has become an expert fighter in their own right."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"As a team, however, they still lack basic coordination─which is of paramount importance if they are to defeat the evil plaguing these shores."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Alas, we are out of time. The Bombard King has made his move and we must rise to stop him even if the Rangers are not fully prepared."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"And that brings me to why I summoned you here today. Should their best efforts fail, we need an adventurer strong enough to ensure the threat is kept at bay─someone like you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Please, will you help them to dethrone this royal pain once and for all?"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Haha! I knew you'd agree! The Posing Rangers are currently preparing for battle at Hidden Falls. I ask that you go and meet them there, for I'm certain they're eager to discuss their strategies with you."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"The Rangers are waiting for you by Hidden Falls. Make haste, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, for the enemy will not wait on our convenience."},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you made it! The Red Ranger should be along shortly, but seeing as the most important members are here, let us start without him."},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"As you are no doubt aware, the Bombards have begun their advance─something which has come much sooner than we anticipated and puts us at a great disadvantage."},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"You see, we've only managed to marginally increase the success rate of our Firefall Battle Formation. It's a maneuver that requires perfect synchronization, and some of us have been struggling with it more than others."},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"I, of course, have perfected the necessary techniques, but Red has a tendency to overthink the steps. His nimble footwork falters, and his powerful swings throw him off balance. Ultimately, an attack which should strike with the force of a hurricane is no more powerful than a mild breeze."},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"All hope is not yet lost, though! We have recently learned of certain mental exercises that increase concentration. If done correctly, we believe they may help the Red Ranger keep his focus during battle!"},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"The Bombards, however, will not wait even those precious few minutes it would require, and so, with a heavy heart, we request that you─the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> we trust above all others─hold off the fiends gathering along the coastline, and buy us the time we so desperately need."},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"But before you leave, there's something we must show you..."},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"...Our true identities! For while you have come to be a dear friend, we have remained masked strangers to you. Therefore, as a show of trust and respect, Beaudefoin and I decided it was time we revealed all."},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"And since he would undoubtedly object with something like, “A hero must never fight for personal glory,” we would prefer that you keep this a secret from the Red─"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Wh-What is the meaning of this!? Where are your masks!?"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"I-I cannot believe it! The both of you─you've broken our oath! A hero must <span class=\"emphasis\">never</span> fight for personal glory!"},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"Come now. You can't honestly expect us to keep our names and faces from <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span> may not wear our colors, but <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> is as much a Posing Ranger as any one of us! ...Or do you mean to say you don't trust the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> to whom we owe so much?"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"On the contrary, Yellow Ranger! Why do you think it is I called upon <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and divulged to <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> our greatest secrets? It is because I trust <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> more than anyone else!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"In any event, let us put this issue to rest for now. Every minute we waste squabbling is another minute the Bombards have to inflict further harm."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I trust these two have already apprised you of the details? Good. Once the fight is over, let us meet back here."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Rangers, to battle!"},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"The last to arrive and the first to leave. Typical! &lt;sigh&gt; Well, not to worry─he can't make it too far in that armor. Beaudefoin and I will see that the Red Ranger's mind is properly centered before heading to meet the Bombards. Godsspeed, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! May we all emerge from this unscathed!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Are you off to fight the Bombards? Good luck, my friend, and stay safe!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Soon after the battle I received word from the Go Go Posing Rangers saying the mission was a success! Ha ha! You should be proud, my friend, for you have helped us defeat the summer menace and restore joy to the realm!"},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"Can you believe it? We did it! We really did it! Ahem. Not that anything could have gone wrong with me heading our assault, of course!"},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. It was only because of your support that we emerged victorious against such slim odds!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"It's all well and good to thank <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> for all <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> help, but the both of you best remember that this is a fight we should have taken on alone!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"We still have a long way to go if we are to become anything like the esteemed Warriors of Light of whom the bards sing!"},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"He finally arrives! I suppose you're late because you were off sulking about the fact that I, Beaudefoin, and my friend <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> here outshined you in combat?"},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"I'm not surprised. Just look at you─too embarassed to even remove your mask, are you!? Hahaha!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Of course not!"},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"Then prove it! Take it off, Red Ranger! After all, there should be no need for such secrecy among friends!"},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"Hildelana's right! Even the Warriors of Light you're so fond of were only successful because they placed their full trust in their comrades and did not keep things from one another!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"You two...finally agreeing on something! &lt;sigh&gt; I don't know whether to feel proud or ashamed."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Forgive me. It seems I have let my preconceptions of what it is to be a hero lead me astray. It is past time I reveal to you who I am!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"But before I do, I just want to express my gratitude to you, Black─nay, Hildelana, you, Beaudefoin, and most especially you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>..."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"It is only because of you that we were able to take down the monster that terrorized these lands!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Haha! I bet you didn't expect it to be <span class=\"emphasis\">me</span> now did you?"},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"Well, it's about time! You could have saved me a lot of trouble and more than a few lectures on “the importance of keeping secrets secrets” if you had just done that from the beginning, as I had suggested!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"I...I feel as though a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders! If this were a play─and we the protagonists─then <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span> would be the moment marking the start of a long and illustrious career of fighting evil for the Go Go Posing Rangers!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"(-???-)In times of desperate need, we hope for a hero. We look to the heavens and pray that someone, somewhere, is watching over us. However, my friend, in doing so, we sometimes overlook the true heroes that walk among us!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"(-???-)Without you, Warrior of Light, the Go Go Posing Rangers would have stood no chance against the blazing summer heat, and it is in <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">women</span><span class=\"alternative\">men</span></span> like you that we find our courage─our power!"},{"name":"HILDELANA","text":"With the stealth of a coeurl that slinks through the night─BLACK RANGER!"},{"name":"BEAUDEFOIN","text":"With the grace of a golden flower dancing in the winds─YELLOW RANGER!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Hot stuff coming through! REEEEEED RANGER!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"And in the name of justice we shall punish all that attempt to take these lands into their vile clutches!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"And so justice prevails and peace is restored to the realm once<br>more by the Go Go Posing Rangers and their faithful friend."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"May they ever watch over Eorzea and deliver her from evil!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You now have access to a wider selection of wares from the Moonfire Faire vendor."}],"reward":{"gil":385,"items":[{"id":15468}],"xp":7410},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":30,"id":1}],"quests":[67675]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1017201","obj":{"i":1017201,"n":"Haermaga","l":32,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1017304","obj":{"i":1017304,"n":"Yellow Ranger","l":32,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"15468","obj":{"i":15468,"n":"Legacy Warrior Mail","l":1,"c":48108,"t":35,"p":156}},{"type":"quest","id":"67675","obj":{"i":67675,"n":"Who Let the Bombs Out","g":201,"l":"Eastern La Noscea","s":111,"r":1}}]}
