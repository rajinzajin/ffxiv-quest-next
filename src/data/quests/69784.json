You'll help, won't you? "},{"name":"LEARNINGWAY","text":"The reserve you're looking for is on the northern end of Greatest Endsvale. Please hurry before they do anything foolish."},{"name":"LEARNINGWAY","text":"I can't imagine what they would want with that water, but we can't risk anything happening to that reserve."},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"Wah! Who are you? What's the matter?"},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"Suspicious? Me? But why? I haven't done anything wrong."},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"Urianger was teaching me about telling fortunes, and I've been trying to practice so I could show the others how it's done."},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"In fact, I even made my own carrot cards, though they're not quite as fancy as Urianger's. I tried using them to see what good fortune will come to the people of Etheirys when they visit the moon, but..."},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"Maybe I did it wrong, but the cards had nothing good to say. I got the complete opposite. So I thought I'd try again after purifying myself in the water here."},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"That is what your people do, yes? I read that it's possible to purify oneself using water, but I don't feel as if anything has changed. Maybe I've missed a step somewhere..."},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"Oh! Could you draw the water for me? Coming from Hydaelyn's chosen, I'm sure it'd be the most purifyingest water ever!"},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"All you have to do is fill this empty bottle with water and pour it on me. Please─the outcome of my carrot card reading is in your hands!"},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"I know good fortune is in the cards for the people of Etheirys. I just need a little help proving it."},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"Ah, how refreshing. I feel like a brand-new Loporrit!"},{"name":"FLUTTERINGLOPORRIT04248","text":"Already I can feel my spirit overflowing with good fortune. Time to have another look at those carrot cards, and see what awaits the people of Etheirys."},{"name":"LEARNINGWAY","text":"Well? Did you find out what that good-for-nothing was up to?"},{"name":"LEARNINGWAY","text":"Oh! Really? Well, that's...actually quite admirable, making such efforts to understand the culture of Etheirys."},{"name":"LEARNINGWAY","text":"That said, I'm not sure one is meant to redraw cards until they find a desired result. Or perhaps I misheard how fortune telling is meant to work..."},{"name":"LEARNINGWAY","text":"...Maybe I should go and talk to them about that."},{"name":"LEARNINGWAY","text":"Then again, there's been no harm done, and they mean well. Perhaps I'll discuss the finer points of card reading with them another day.
