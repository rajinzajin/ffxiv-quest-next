{"quest":{"name":"A Notable Absence","location":"Eulmore","id":69214,"patch":5.1,"sort":60,"eventIcon":71201,"issuer":1031742,"target":1031746,"genre":9,"journal":["For all his comforting words, Alphinaud is plainly troubled by Master Chai's sudden disappearance."],"objectives":["Gather information in the Canopy.","Gather information in the Buttress.","Gather information in the Derelicts.","Speak with Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Y'know, Eulmore's nothing like I thought it'd be. But somehow, I can't picture going anywhere else."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"The Chais are part of it, I s'pose. They've been good to me. I only wish there was something more I could do to help them..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It makes no sense for Master Chai to have left without a word. But even if he had, he would not have done so unobserved."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Someone</span> here will have seen something. I am sure of it."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We should split up and inquire as to whether anyone saw him leave or, failing that, if they have any idea where he might have gone. I will meet you at the Glory Gate to compare notes later on."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"It would seem Master Chai paid a visit to the Beehive before taking his leave of Eulmore. Unfortunately, the patrons I spoke with were too deep in their cups to remember aught else."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"...You ever get the feeling you're being watched? Ahh, I'm probably just imagining things."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You find a shoebill gazing in Kai-Shirr's general direction. Silent. Vigilant. Plotting...?"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"Master Chai? Why yes, I spoke with him recently, though I recall he was in a rather dour mood. Concerned about Eulmore's neglect of industry, you see."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"With Lord Vauthry's apparently inexhaustible stores of meol, and no great need for money, it's little wonder our businesses were all but forgotten under his rule."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"But I assured Master Chai that the Boutique of Splendors will do all it can to contribute to the revival of trade here in Eulmore─which seemed to satisfy him. He took his leave soon after."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Your exchange with Mowen has taught you about “The stagnant state of business in Eulmore.”"},{"name":"CORNENNE","text":"Looking for Master Chai, are you? Is something amiss? When last I saw him, he seemed ready to collapse from exhaustion. I insisted he rest and catch his breath, and we talked for a while─about his concerns over the city's defenses amongst other things."},{"name":"CORNENNE","text":"He made more than a few valid points. Many of our men are still recovering after your confrontation with Lord Vauthry, and finding General Ran'jit in a heap in the middle of the plaza shook us all to the core."},{"name":"CORNENNE","text":"The man commanded no small amount of loyalty, and some of our longest-serving soldiers seemed lost without him. Indeed, a number of them left."},{"name":"CORNENNE","text":"N-Not that we blame <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>, of course. Without you and yours, we would still be blind to the error of our ways."},{"name":"CORNENNE","text":"Anyway...funding permitting, I proposed replenishing our ranks with volunteers from the Derelicts and Gatetown."},{"name":"CORNENNE","text":"We have a duty to protect not only Eulmore, you see, but the surrounding regions of Kholusia as well, and I for one would welcome any man or woman willing to take up arms for that cause. Indeed, I told him as much, and he seemed relieved to hear it. It was on that note that we parted ways. He headed outside, as I recall."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Your exchange with Cornenne has taught you about “The perilous state of Eulmore's defenses.”"},{"name":"HATHENBET","text":"Aye, I recall a man fittin' that description. Asked to speak with the poor buggers lately come from Wright."},{"name":"HATHENBET","text":"Said he wanted to know the state of things down in the Derelicts. And you can be sure we gave him an earful. Lack of food, medicine, clothin'─there was plenty to tell."},{"name":"HATHENBET","text":"We hunt high and low for whatever we can scavenge, and it's barely enough to fill our bellies. But folk here don't just want to survive, they want to thrive!"},{"name":"HATHENBET","text":"When he heard that, he started mumblin' to himself. Somethin' about findin' us work, I think."},{"name":"HATHENBET","text":"Fair play to him, though─not content with havin' his ear chewed about the Derelicts, he asked about the other settlements an' all. After that, I can't really say. Looked like he was headed for Gatetown when I last saw him."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Your exchange with Hathenbet has taught you about “The poor living conditions of Kholusia's downtrodden.”"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"I know not what Master Chai is planning, but if he intends to bring business back to Eulmore, he has my wholehearted support."},{"name":"CORNENNE","text":"Master Chai seemed genuinely concerned over our lack of numbers. Would that we had the money to hire more guards..."},{"name":"HATHENBET","text":"What? I told you everythin' I know. If you're after that Chai bloke, you won't find him here."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Any luck? I got nowhere myself, but it sounds like Alphinaud might have."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Ah, there you are. How did you fare? Have you learned anything which might offer a clue as to Master Chai's whereabouts?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Interesting..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"He apparently paid a visit to the Queen Bee as well."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"They discussed the possibility of granting admission to customers from outside Eulmore, an idea to which the proprietor was surprisingly receptive."},{"name":"KAISHIRR","text":"Sounds like he's got big plans for the place. Eulmore, I mean─not the Bee."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Perhaps. But the question remains─where did he go after leaving the city?"}],"reward":{"gil":655},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":142}],"quests":[69213]},"next":[69215]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1031742","obj":{"i":1031742,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2952,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1031746","obj":{"i":1031746,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2952,"q":2}},{"type":"quest","id":"69213","obj":{"i":69213,"n":"Nowhere to Turn","g":9,"l":"Amh Araeng","s":50}},{"type":"quest","id":"69215","obj":{"i":69215,"n":"For the People","g":9,"l":"Eulmore","s":70}}]}
