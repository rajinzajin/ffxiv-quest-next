My inquisitive senses feel even more heightened than ever! Most auspicious timing, as it would seem the fiend I pursue has set his sights on his greatest prize yet, an act which I am bound by duty and honor to foil. The exact nature of this final Belah'dian relic eludes me for the moment, but for Hildibrand─agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire─inspiration is always but a stone's throw away!<br>　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*<br>The news Ellie shares with you is chilling indeed. Three prominent citizens of the sultanate have been murdered in cold blood, and evidence at the scene suggests that the thief of many faces is responsible. Meanwhile, the exact nature of the fourth and final relic that the thief is targeting remains unknown. At a loss for leads, Ellie proposes a visit to the sultanate's leading information-monger. Seek out Wymond on the Steps of Nald.","Details on the phantom thief's movements are scarce, with Wymond able to offer only the knowledge that the Sultansworn have redoubled their efforts to keep the royal vaults safe from your quarry. He accompanies this with an ominous warning that this case may prove more dangerous than your previous forays. Ellie remains undaunted, and bids you accompany her to the Heart of the Sworn to seek further information from those in the know.","At your destination, you are reunited with none other than Humphrey, the erstwhile two-gil swindler who has since amended his ways and enlisted in the Sultansworn with dreams of serving the realm not unlike Hildibrand, whom he idolizes. In return for your efforts in introducing him to his newfound role model, he introduces you to Phillice, who is leading the investigation. She is being assisted by Consulting Inspector Briardien, who has devised an ingenious powder capable of dispelling the phantom thief's disguises, and Hildibrand, who is convinced he has something to offer the investigation as well. After a less-than-enlightening briefing from Phillice on the details of the murders, you prepare to take to the field. Consult with Hildibrand as to your next course of action.","Hildibrand suggests that you begin your search at the Eighty Sins of Sasamo, where the most recent victim's body was discovered. Make your way to western Thanalan and rendezvous with the inspector.","Your inspection of the crime scene turns up a scattering of flowers, soon revealed to be placed there by the victim's elderly mother in memory of her departed son. Seemingly driven half-mad in her grief, the old woman spins a chilling─if somewhat far-fetched─tale of living men turned to zombies by a vengeful specter wielding the powers of forbidden Sil'dihn alchemy. Doubtless Inspector Hildibrand has his own theories as to the plausibility of the woman's ramblings..."],"objectives":["Speak with Wymond near Sunsilk Tapestries.","Seek out information at Scholars' Walk.","Speak with Hildibrand.","Speak with Hildibrand at the Eighty Sins of Sasamo."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ELLIE","text":"I was wondering when you'd show up, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!

No, the only thing my readers like more than a good mystery is a good <span class=\"emphasis\">murder</span> mystery. Ever since the story broke, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Mythril Eye</span>'s been selling like ponzecakes!"},{"name":"ELLIE","text":"The only rub is that it's left me no time to look into the thief's last message...until now, that is! Shall we, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"ELLIE","text":"The hidden treasure of Ul'dah, was it? If there's anyone who can shed some light on this, it's you-know-who.

Ul'dah has more than its fair share o' treasures, hidden an' otherwise. I reckon our phantom friend could be after just about any of 'em."},{"name":"WYMOND","text":"...I <span class=\"emphasis\">can</span> tell you this much, though. Whatever the thief's got his eyes on, it's got the Sultansworn in a right dither. Word has it they've formed a regiment o' their best and brightest to safeguard the royal vaults from this very threat."},{"name":"ELLIE","text":"The Sultansworn aren't like to be forthcoming with information, but it's the only lead we've got.

Tell me, what tall tales did you spin to the Sultansworn recruiter to land yourself in this position?"},{"name":"HUMPHREY","text":"O-Only the Twelve's honest truth, miss! Seeing that Gentleman of Light standing tall and triumphant that day, it <span class=\"emphasis\">moved</span> me─to the depths of me soul, like.

The Sultansworn were impressed with my commitment and my sword arm, and they gladly welcomed me into their ranks."},{"name":"HUMPHREY","text":"Wait, don't tell me─you've come to assist Master Hildibrand in his investigation, haven't you?

The phantom thief's pulled the wool over our eyes for the last time!"},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"I fear it won't be so simple. The ingredients necessary to produce the dust are exceedingly rare. Even with the entire resources of the Sultansworn at our disposal, we were only able to produce a limited supply."},{"name":"ELLIE","text":"...I see. Well, I suppose it's better than nothing. That said, have you been able to identify the thief's next target? A hidden treasure of Ul'dah, the last of the four lost relics of Belah'dia..."},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"I fear not. I've pored through the histories time and again, but the only mention of these four relics is a vague reference in an old prophecy. Most serious scholars consider it little more than a faerie tale."},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"“When darkness falls, and hope fades to despair, four warriors born of Light shall descend, in the righteous glare.”"},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"The legend goes on to describe four sacred artifacts─one each possessed by these four Belah'dian heroes─but makes no mention as to their appearance or nature."},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"Three times we have tried to identify the thief's target, and three times has he foiled us by making off with something else entirely. Needless speculation will only play to the fiend's strengths."},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"All artifacts of Belah'dian origin have been sealed within the royal vault, and a regiment of our finest assigned to its protection. I have furnished all the guards with a supply of demasking dust, and instructed them to be on the lookout for any suspicious personages."},{"name":"GUIGUE","text":"The blackguard will be in chains before he can lay a dirty hand on the vault doors, let alone the treasures within. You have our word, my lady."},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"...But there are even more disturbing matters at hand. Doubtless you have heard of the recent rash of murders perpetrated by our quarry."},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"The Sultansworn have launched an investigation, but the truth of the matter is that we have been far too occupied with the defense of the vaults to make any meaningful progress. We would be most grateful for any assistance you could offer."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"(-???-)A lady asks...and a gentleman answers!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Cast all worry from your heart, my lady. Hildibrand─agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire─has arrived to set right what is wrong and bring the wicked to justice."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"...And this must be the demasking dust that is the talk of the palace! Ah, but you need not waste your supply on me, Inspector. I assure you that I am exactly who I claim to be!"},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"...A shame, that."},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"I-Inspector Hildibrand. We were not expecting you, but your services are most welcome. I will share all I know about the recent murders."},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"The killer has claimed three victims thus far: the head of a publishing consortium, a high-ranking government official, and an influential scholar. Other than that they were all influential figures in their respective circles, we can identify no common threads connecting the three."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Oho! This will prove a most satisfying case to crack indeed! And what of the method of killing? Conked over the head with a cudgel? Gutted with a great sword? Strangled with a subligar, mayhap!?"},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"I-I'm afraid that we've identified no pattern. In any event, the murderer plots the deaths of two more even as we speak! We must take action, and quickly!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Understood, my lady! Clues may be scarce, but worry not─my realm-renowned powers of deduction are more than up to the task. I will see this burglar-turned-butcher delivered to justice!"},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"Your presence is heartening indeed, Inspector Hildibrand. Friends, please take this demasking dust with you. I fear we can spare but a single sachet, but I trust you will put it to good use."},{"name":"ELLIE","text":"He may have a thousand faces, but with Inspector Briardien's demasking dust, the masquerade will soon be over."},{"name":"HUMPHREY","text":"The Gentleman of Light, in the flesh! Hells, he's every bit as muscular and majestic as I remembered!"},{"name":"PHILLICE","text":"On behalf of the Sultansworn, your assistance with the murder investigation is greatly appreciated. Leave the defense of the royal vault to us."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Come to accompany me on yet another case, friend? I like your gusto! But if you're auditioning to be my assistant, I fear that role has already been filled most ably."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Still, a gentleman welcomes the support of all of his admirers. I shall henceforth name you thusly: <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, my ever-loyal associate!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"And now, my ever-loyal associate, the investigation calls! I propose that we begin by inspecting the site at which the most recent victim met his demise."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"My questioning about the palace has revealed that the scholar's body was found not far from the Eighty Sins of Sasamo."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Even the most circumspect of criminals cannot help but leave behind clues─clues that will not elude my gaze! Friends, let us be off!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Pray alert me should you see anyone suspicious, my ever-loyal associate. We must put Miss Phillice's demasking dust to good use!"},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"Flowers. How intriguing..."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Flowers...? Yes, it is all becoming clear now! Our phantom killer is a florist, who, in his hurry to escape, carelessly mislaid his wares!"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"(-???-)Just what do ye think yer doing!? Eh!? Eh!?"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">I'm</span> the one what put those flowers there, eh!? To honor the memory o' me poor boy! Ye dare defile his memory, eh? Eh!?"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"A thousand pardons, my lady! Please accept my most sincere condolences on your loss. I am Hildibrand─agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire. I swear to you─on my own dear mother's name─that your son's killer will be brought to justice."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Ahem! As I was just saying, these flowers were clearly placed here by the family of the deceased, which can only mean..."},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"L-Leave this place... Run away, while you still can... Run far, far away!"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"Run, or he'll turn you into a zombie. Just like my poor, poor boy!"},{"name":"BRIARDIEN","text":"A living person turned into a zombie? Nonsense!"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"Not nonsense, my boy...history! Or have you not heard of the horrors of Sil'dih? Aye, Ul'dah's sibling nation, against which we waged war centuries ago."},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"Much blood was shed by both sides, aye. But I speak of far greater horrors than death. An unholy draught brewed by a Sil'dihn alchemist─one with the power to turn the living to the undead, that his nation might command an army of mindless, deathless soldiers. The Traders' Spurn!"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"They turned my poor boy into a heap of rottin' flesh and ran him through. But ye won't hear that from the Sultansworn. Thal alone knows why, but they whisked the body away before I could so much as pay me last respects..."},{"name":"ELLIE","text":"...The Traders' Spurn? I'd heard the stories, but I never thought them true! To be able to procure such a frightening thing─just who are we dealing with here!?"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"A Sil'dihn, I'm sure of it. Aye, only a Sil'dihn would know the recipe..."},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"But the last remnants of Sil'dih died four centuries ago, you say!? Heeehaheahaeh! Oh, they did, they did! Heahehaheheeehah!"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"He calls himself the phantom thief, he does, but did it ever occur to ye that he might be an honest-to-gods <span class=\"emphasis\">phantom</span>? Eh!? Eh!?"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"Heard the tales from my own great-great-grandma, I did. About the four relics of Belah'dia, and the powers they hold. The power to exact justice!"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"A specter of Sil'dih has returned to wreak vengeance on us. Woe, woe unto us all! Have the four Warriors of Light forsaken us!?"},{"name":"OLD00490","text":"My dear boy! If only you'd become a trader like your father! If only you'd kept your nose out o' those history books, and never so much breathed the accursed name o' Sil'dih! But you did, and now we're doomed! Doomed! Doooooomed!
