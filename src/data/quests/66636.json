Coupled with information gleaned from other sources, he believes he has deduced the raiments' design. However, he wishes to conclusively verify their historical accuracy by recreating the garments and gauging your faerie's reaction. In order to do so, he will need to enlist the aid of a preeminent Eorzean weaver─namely, Master Redolent Rose of Sunsilk Tapestries. Approaching him now would be premature, though, as you must first gather the leaves of a direwort. These plants, which can be found only in the Fogfens of Mor Dhona, are essential for producing the distinct colors of a Nymian scholar's uniform.","Your initial attempt to gather the direwort leaves is foiled by the sudden appearance of belligerent wildlife, which you are forced to dispatch. Hopefully, your second attempt will not be so rudely interrupted.","To your relief, no rampaging beast attempts to devour you this time. Journey to Ul'dah and speak with Redolent Rose, who should have hopefully been contacted by Alka Zolka by now.","Redolent Rose works feverishly to render the ancient designs into modern creations. Alas, his skill is insufficient to produce more than the culottes; the other pieces will require the skills of a master goldsmith and leatherworker. Realizing that you were not aware of this fact, Redolent Rose offers to contact Mistresses Serendipity and Geva of the Goldsmiths' and Leatherworkers' Guilds on your behalf, so that you need only visit each guild and present the items to receive their help.","The ever-cheerful Serendipity requires but a moment to fashion a mythril tassel for your mortarboard. You can only hope that Geva will work with similar alacrity.","Geva effortlessly crafts a pair of fingerless gloves in accordance with Alka Zolka's designs. However, she has no intention of spoiling you further, and bids you speak with Beli, her subordinate, about the boots.","Beli relishes the opportunity to finish the famed Redolent Rose's work, wasting no time in constructing the leather boots. Now that the set is complete, all that remains is to show Alka Zolka what the craftsmen have wrought.","Alka Zolka is thrilled by the resemblance you bear to the Nymian scholars of eld. He is not alone in his excitement, as your faerie also appears to approve of your new raiments. Wear them with pride as you continue to pursue your studies."],"objectives":["Search for a direwort shrub in Mor Dhona.","Harvest leaves from the direwort shrub.","Deliver the leaves and thesis to Redolent Rose in Ul'dah.","Ask Serendipity to finish Redolent Rose's work.","Ask Geva in Gridania to finish Redolent Rose's work.","Ask Beli to finish Redolent Rose's work.","Speak with Alka Zolka at the Marauders' Guild."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Good to see you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I have made yet another discovery which pertains to you and your scholarly arts."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"I have come into possession of several ancient engravings, including some which show the traditional raiments of Nymian scholars."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"In fact, the extraordinary detail of these illustrations, coupled with information gleaned from other sources, was sufficient to deduce their design."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"At present, it is impossible to say how historically accurate my designs are. That is why I propose we enlist the aid of Eorzea's preeminent artisans, so that we might recreate these garments. Should they prove sufficiently authentic, I expect your faerie will regain more of her missing memories."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"In the hands of a preeminent weaver─say, Master Redolent Rose of Sunsilk Tapestries─this information should be sufficient."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Ah, but you cannot journey to Ul'dah until you have gathered the leaves of a direwort. My texts explicitly mention that the plant's pigments were used to dye Nymian uniforms."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Alas, direwort is much rarer than it was in the days of yore. It can only be found in the Fogfens now."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Lest you think I mean to make you do all the work, worry not. While you scour Mor Dhona for the plant, I will contact Master Rose and convince him to help─though I doubt it will require much effort!"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Do not forget to obtain the direwort leaves before journeying to Ul'dah! Without them, it will be impossible to reproduce the distinct colors of a Nymian scholar's uniform."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"...I suppose you <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> have a rather scholarly air about you. I've been expecting you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Have you the leaves and Alka Zolka's designs, then?"},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"Crafting raiments that have not been seen in fifteen hundred years... This is indeed a daunting challenge."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"But it is one I suspect I will enjoy a great deal, for rare is the day a weaver revives ancient fashion!"},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"I shall begin at once. You may observe if you like, but be aware it will be a lengthy process..."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"It...it has been some time since I labored with such...intensity."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"I adhered to Alka Zolka's designs as best I could, though there were certain aspects I felt compelled to change. His lack of familiarity with textiles and weaving led to what I can only assume are errors."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"You will note that I could only complete the culottes. This is because the other garments require skills which I do not possess."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"Mistresses Serendipity and Geva of the Goldsmiths' and Leatherworkers' Guilds, respectively, can provide the finishing touches to the remaining pieces."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"Ah, but you were unaware that I could not craft the full set by myself, weren't you?"},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"Very well. I shall send word to them on your behalf, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. You will need only visit each guild and present to them my unfinished work."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"You may wear the culottes at your leisure, but the boots, gloves, and mortarboard remain unfinished."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"Only a master goldsmith and leatherworker have the skill to complete the three remaining pieces."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"So, if you wish to finish what you have started, then make haste for the Goldsmiths' and Leatherworkers' Guilds."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"I will see that the two guildmasters know to expect you."},{"name":"SERENDIPITY","text":"Greetings, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Red said you'd be along shortly. So, let's see that mortarboard!"},{"name":"SERENDIPITY","text":"Hmmm... This shouldn't take long. Wait here a moment."},{"name":"SERENDIPITY","text":"Here it is, as promised. Amazing what a difference a mythril tassel can make, isn't it?"},{"name":"SERENDIPITY","text":"Wear it with pride, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Now, off you go! And be sure to enjoy your time in Gridania!"},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> who would single-handedly revive the scholarly arts. All right, then, show me what you've got."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Master Rose's work is marvelous, as to be expected. This will be a pleasure."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"There you go─one pair of fingerless buffalo leather gloves, perfect for the scholar who prefers that <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> protection does not come at a cost to dexterity."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"Oh, the boots? Beli will see to those. He's an expert cordwainer, so you needn't worry about the quality. Besides, I've already spoiled you by making your gloves for free."},{"name":"BELI","text":"You're the scholar, yes? I've been instructed to assist you. If you would please let me see Master Rose's work..."},{"name":"BELI","text":"This craftsmanship is amazing! I cannot wait to get started."},{"name":"BELI","text":"Here you are, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. Made with the finest boar and buffalo leather, in accordance with Alka Zolka's designs─which are <span class=\"emphasis\">very</span> impressive, I must say."},{"name":"BELI","text":"He must be dying to see the completed set. I know I would be, had I gone to such great lengths. You ought to surprise him by wearing the garments when next you meet him."},{"name":"REDOLENTROSE","text":"...Should a chirurgeon humor the imbecile who sticks his hand in a fire just to see what will happen? You are a fool, and you know it. Fortunately for you, so did I, which is why I prepared another pair of culottes for this eventuality."},{"name":"SERENDIPITY","text":"Wow, you really are as foolish as Red said! He came by earlier and gave me additional mortarboards, saying that you'd probably come back and ask for another."},{"name":"GEVA","text":"I don't know what's more impressive: Master Rose's prescience, or your idiocy. Be thankful I don't skin you for this."},{"name":"BELI","text":"Matron's teats! Why would you go and do a foolish thing like that? I mean, really, that's just...damn. You should count your blessings that Master Rose leaves nothing to chance."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"...Although I am certain this is not necessary, on the off chance you <span class=\"emphasis\">misplaced</span> any pieces of the set, go back and speak with the artisans. If we are fortunate, they may be able to furnish us with replacements."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! By your return I take it the raiments are ready? If so, would you consider donning them so I might see if they match the ancient descriptions?"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"By the gods, I feel as though I have been transported backwards through time!"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"You are the very image of the Nymian scholars of eld!"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Well, minus the gown, but still! Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would turn out this well."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Hah, I see you approve as well, little one! Suffice it to say, we can consider this a great success."},{"name":"POP","text":"A foul stench fills your nostrils..."}],"reward":{"xp":12420},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":45,"id":29}],"quests":[66635]},"next":[66637]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006757","obj":{"i":1006757,"n":"Alka Zolka","l":28,"q":11}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000357","obj":{"i":1000357,"n":"Beli","l":53,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000691","obj":{"i":1000691,"n":"Geva","l":53,"q":20,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1003818","obj":{"i":1003818,"n":"Redolent Rose","l":41,"q":21,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1004093","obj":{"i":1004093,"n":"Serendipity","l":41,"q":29,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"item","id":"3466","obj":{"i":3466,"n":"Scholar's Culottes","l":50,"c":45328,"t":36,"p":1000}},{"type":"item","id":"2905","obj":{"i":2905,"n":"Scholar's Mortarboard","l":50,"c":41171,"t":34,"p":1000}},{"type":"item","id":"3689","obj":{"i":3689,"n":"Scholar's Gloves","l":50,"c":44186,"t":37,"p":1000}},{"type":"item","id":"3897","obj":{"i":3897,"n":"Scholar's Boots","l":50,"c":46346,"t":38,"p":1000}},{"type":"quest","id":"66635","obj":{"i":66635,"n":"The Consequences of Anger","g":156,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":3,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"66637","obj":{"i":66637,"n":"For Your Fellow Man","g":156,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":5,"f":1}}]}
