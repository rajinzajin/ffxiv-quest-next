If you should happen upon any mages of the Blessed in the woods, would you make sure they are all right?"},{"name":"ROGUE03448","text":"The hells do you think you're doing? We've got wares to sell!"},{"name":"MENTOR03448","text":"A spearman is searching for me? Ah, my apologies. My return from patrol was delayed by these two."},{"name":"MENTOR03448","text":"They released some strange creature here in the woods, and tried to assault me before it could be subdued.

Folks will pay well for a good poison."},{"name":"ROGUE03448","text":"But thanks to you, the anemone and all our profits are gone.
