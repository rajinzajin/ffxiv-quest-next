The Antecedent bids you answer the request of the Elder Seedseer, and offer your aid to the people of the forest. Travel to Gridania and report to Serpent Commander Vorsaile Heuloix at the Adders' Nest.","Serpent Commander Heuloix seems much relieved at your arrival. Though eager for you to begin your mission, he asks that you first meet with Kan–E–Senna at the Lotus Stand to discuss diplomatic alternatives. Speak with the silent conjurer at Nophica's Altar to gain admission.","The Elder Seedseer confirms that the primal Ramuh has indeed been summoned forth by the natives of the Sylphlands. Loath to sacrifice the hard-won peace with the sylphs, she asks that you attempt to parley with the Lord of Levin before resorting to force. Travel to Little Solace in the East Shroud and report to the serpent lieutenant who will brief you on how to proceed.","After welcoming you to Little Solace, the serpent lieutenant informs you that an investigation is already underway to determine where the primal Ramuh might be found. Bide your time until such time as the report is delivered, then speak with the lieutenant once more."],"objectives":["Speak with Vorsaile Heuloix at the Adders' Nest.","Speak with Kan–E–Senna at the Lotus Stand.","Speak with the serpent lieutenant at Little Solace."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MESSENGER01447","text":"I am come on behalf of the Elder Seedseer to petition the aid of your order. The Antecedent has been apprised of the situation."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Thank you for responding to my call with such haste."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Rest assured, I should not have summoned you were it not urgent. To business, then: I have received some most disturbing news from the Order of the Twin Adder. They have reason to believe that the sylphs may have called forth their revered guardian─the primal Ramuh."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I'm sorry, “may have”? Then it is not certain?"},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"The Elder Seedseer informs us that the elementals themselves murmur of the Lord of Levin's return to the forest. The Sylphlands, however, display no signs of undue commotion."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"Forgive me, Antecedent, but that fact need not contradict the elementals' testimony. Unlike his more bellicose compeers─Garuda and so on─Ramuh is reputed to act only in the defense of his children."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"I imagine he would soon make his presence known if any were foolish enough to directly endanger the sylphs or their territory."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"The abruptness of this development concerns me. Were we not keeping a close watch on the “touched ones” and their movements?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"If preparations for a summoning ritual were indeed underway, 'twould surely not have escaped your notice."},{"name":"YDA","text":"Oh, it didn't. I was pretty sure it was going to happen─just not this soon."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I beg your pardon? You foresaw this eventuality and did naught to prevent it!?"},{"name":"YDA","text":"I-I told Papalymo! I suppose I <span class=\"emphasis\">could</span> have reported things to Minfilia earlier...but there honestly wasn't much we could do except wait and see."},{"name":"YDA","text":"You know how the sylphs feel about people poking around in their territory."},{"name":"YDA","text":"They already summoned Ramuh once right after the Calamity, but that was because the Garleans came tramping through the forest..."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"...And so long as Castrum Oriens stands, the sylphs cannot be blamed for wishing to have their guardian deity on hand."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"In short, Yda and I are in agreement. The actions of the forest folk were inevitable and unavoidable."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"And I maintain that observation would have remained the best policy had it not been for the sudden influx of strangers into the Black Shroud. That, alas, we did not foresee..."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"By all accounts, the recent violence in Ul'dah drove a number of refugees to seek safety under the concealing canopy of the trees."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"'Tis like that the sylphs perceived this panicked migration as yet another invasion, and quickened their efforts to summon their god."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I am put in mind of Titan and the kobolds. Once again, it is the affairs of men which have paved the way for a primal's coming."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"Indeed. One cannot help but wonder what manner of place Eorzea would be without the “civilizing influence” of mankind... Be that as it may, this regrettable development <span class=\"emphasis\">does</span> afford us a unique opportunity."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─through your dealings with the sylphs of Little Solace, you once succeeded in preventing an untimely conflict with Gridania."},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"I wonder...might one who has treated with the sylphs so fruitfully in the past not achieve similar success with their patron deity?"},{"name":"PAPALYMO","text":"If Ramuh can be convinced of our intentions, it may be the first step to breaking the cycle of primal summoning."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"...A fond hope. Were such a thing possible, we would not have been at war with the beastmen since time immemorial."},{"name":"YDA","text":"But maybe this time we can─"},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Let us continue this discussion anon. We must needs first consult with the nation most affected by Ramuh's presence."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"The Elder Seedseer has requested your personal involvement, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Pray report to Commander Heuloix at the Adders' Nest as soon as you are able."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"Steel yourself for the worst. While I hope for a peaceful resolution to this matter, experience suggests that your meeting with the Lord of Levin will prove less than amicable. In such an event, your fellow Scions will of course lend you whatever support you require."},{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"The Elder Seedseer has asked for you by name.

The appearance of a primal is ever cause for alarm and unease."},{"name":"VORSAILE","text":"Though my men stand ready for any eventuality, I know of none more qualified than you to snuff out this threat. Indeed, I would have you do so without delay. The Elder Seedseer, however, would speak with you first."},{"name":"VORSAILE","text":"She is of the opinion that your diplomatic─rather than martial─skills may better serve our cause. I will leave further explanation to our learned leader. Pray make your way to Nophica's Altar.

There can be no doubt, then..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I am most curious to hear how the Elder Seedseer means to treat with Lord Ramuh."},{"name":"SYLPH01448","text":"Oh! Hello, walking one!
