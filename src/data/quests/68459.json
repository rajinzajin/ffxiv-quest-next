While he has not expounded upon why, it seems extremely urgent. Make your way to upper La Noscea to learn what is amiss at the Wanderer's Palace.","Surito Carito reveals that his study of the invisible voidsent's corpse has yielded a quasi-cure capable of impeding the spread of the Nymian plague. A miraculous discovery though it may be, he goes on to say that the reason he summoned you is because one of his research assistants, Setoto, has vanished. Worried that harm will befall his friend should they wander too far, he asks that you find and escort the tonberry back. Alka believes there is a chance Setoto has been registered to the Hunt, and suggests you begin your search at the Maelstrom Command.","The Hunt billmaster informs you that the only tonberry currently registered to the Hunt is one by the name of Marberry. Not too long after, R'ashaht appears bearing some interesting news. The Miqo'te commander tells you that Vesper Bay has been awash with rumors of an odd-looking stowaway who scurried off a ferry as it pulled ashore. Whoever─or whatever─it was, has been described as being small of stature like a Lalafell but with exotic features. Perhaps this mysterious passenger is your missing tonberry, and it would benefit you to investigate this matter further.","You and Alka approach a sailor who looks to be a crew member of the boat R'ashaht mentioned. The man confirms having seen the stowaway, which he describes as some manner of rare beast of a gobbie without a mask. He assures you that whatever it was, the Brass Blades are looking for it. While Alka makes a detour to Ul'dah to see what more he can uncover though his contacts regarding this incident, he asks that you inform Surito Carito of all that has happened.","Surito Carito is of the opinion that, if in Aldenard, Setoto will be near impossible to find. He believes it would be best to wait until you come across any additional news on where the missing tonberry might have gone before making a move. Rest while you can because as soon as word of Setoto's possible whereabouts reaches you and Alka Zolka, the two of you must rush to find, and possibly rescue, the tonberry.<br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Surito Carito upon reaching level 63."],"objectives":["Speak with Surito Carito near the Wanderer's Palace.","Speak with the Maelstrom Command Hunt billmaster.","Rendezvous with Alka Zolka in Vesper Bay.","Report to Surito Carito near the Wanderer's Palace."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, that you should arrive at this very instant─it is as though the gods themselves have sent you."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Not a quarter bell ago I received a missive from Surito Carito. An emergency has arisen at the Wanderer's Palace, and he has requested our immediate presence."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"While the exact nature of this trouble remains unclear, we can scarce ignore his call."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"He awaits us at his usual place. Come, my friend, we haven't a moment to waste!"},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Alka Zolka, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Thank you both for responding so swiftly to my summons."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Forgive my brusqueness, but I believe it best if we cut straight to business. I presume the both of you remember the invisible voidsent we defeated not too long ago?"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"We could scarce forget such a vile creature."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Well, you'll be pleased to hear that I have finished studying its remains and believe a cure may be within my grasp."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Ah, but mayhap “cure” is a slight exaggeration. What I speak of will only halt the spread of the sickness, not reverse all of the effects it has had on our bodies."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Surito Carito, you are far too modest a man! Truly, what you speak of is incredible─a miracle, even."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Alas, it is not to be praised for the progress I've made that I asked you here today. You see, Setoto, one of my comrades who has been assisting me in my experiments, has mysteriously vanished."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"I am terribly worried. While the rancor has subsided from most of our hearts, we still retain our tonberry forms. Were we to wander too far from our home here, any number of organizations would be more than happy to have us hunted down."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"That is why I would ask that you─my two most trusted associates─locate and escort Setoto back to the Wanderer's Palace before it's too late."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Of course we'll do it. We can hardly ignore the pleas of one of Nym's foremost scholars!"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I have an idea of where we can start. Let us check with the Grand Companies to see if a bounty has been placed on Setoto's head."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Bounty? &lt;sigh&gt; Let us hope it has not yet come to that..."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"The Maelstrom Command is in Limsa Lominsa. There, we should be able to ask the Hunt billmaster if any tonberries have recently been registered."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"We've done this a million times, and yet something about today has me feeling incredibly restless. Please, let us hurry and see what Surito Carito has to say."},{"name":"HUNTBILLMASTER","text":"Good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">evening</span><span class=\"alternative\">morning</span><span class=\"alternative\">day</span></span> to you, sir. How might I be of service to you today?"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"We're looking to save─er─<span class=\"emphasis\">slay</span> a tonberry."},{"name":"HUNTBILLMASTER","text":"A tonberry, eh? We currently have only one tonberry marked for the Hunt by the name of Marberry."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Marberry? If I recall correctly, he was marked for the Hunt from even before Setoto disappeared. The possibility of there being a mix-up between the two is slim. It seems we must continue our search elsewhere."},{"name":"RASHAHTRHIKI","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">[GC Rank]</span><span class=\"alternative\"> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span></span><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> of the Scions</span></span>, Alka.

I think I may have forgotten to say so the other day, but I greatly appreciated your help with my training."},{"name":"RASHAHTRHIKI","text":"You know I'm always happy to help. I don't suppose you've come all this way to thank me, however. What brings the two of you here?"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"We're searching for an escaped tonberry and thought it might have been marked for the Hunt."},{"name":"RASHAHTRHIKI","text":"A tonberry, you say?"},{"name":"RASHAHTRHIKI","text":"While I can't promise this is in any way related, a few days back a disturbance broke out in Vesper Bay. They discovered a stowaway hiding in one of the ferries."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Indeed?"},{"name":"RASHAHTRHIKI","text":"Witnesses say that a small green blur leapt from between the crates and dashed out of sight as soon as the ship pulled into port."},{"name":"RASHAHTRHIKI","text":"While of a similar size and build to a Lalafell or Qiqirn, they claim it looked far too alien to be either."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Hm... Thank you, R'ashaht. It sounds like you may have just given us our first lead!"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, after me!

For a moment I thought I had lost you. Let us begin by questioning this man here─he appears to be one of the men from the ferry R'ashaht told us about."},{"name":"DARKSAILOR02923","text":"Yer askin' if I saw the stowaway? Aye. Ye bet I did."},{"name":"DARKSAILOR02923","text":"Now it wasn't just any stowaway what boarded our ship. Nay. I suspect it was a one o' 'em fellas─a gob─without his mask. Either that, or it's a rare beastie ye can't find around these here parts. Not that it matter, mind ye."},{"name":"DARKSAILOR02923","text":"Whatever it was, the Brass Blades are after it, and ye best be sure they'll catch it."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Indeed. Thank you for all your help, sir."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"If an organization that large has yet to find the stowaway, we've little chance of succeeding in such an endeavor ourselves."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Rather than blindly rushing about, our time would be better spent gathering what information we can regarding this incident. I shall go and speak with my acquaintances in Ul'dah. In the meantime, I ask that you return to Surito Carito and inform him of all that we learned."},{"name":"DARKSAILOR02923","text":"What in the gods' name was that thing? I ain't never seen anythin' like it."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I can only hope your swift return means you come bearing good news."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"...Has crossed the sea and is likely now in Thanalan, you say!? What could possibly have spurred our friend to do such a thing?"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Surito Carito, forgive my tardiness."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"I made a small detour to Ul'dah to speak with my associates. Unfortunately, they could tell me nothing aside from the fact that the Brass Blades are looking into who the stowaway might be. I've, nevertheless, asked that they keep an ear to the ground and report to me should they learn more."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Thank you, Alka Zolka. &lt;sigh&gt; If, as you suspect, our friend has fled to the vast continent of Aldenard, there is little sense in us conducting any more searches."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Judging by the Brass Blades' inability to find their quarry, we should have no need to worry about the Hunt or any other institution capturing Setoto for now. Our best option is to wait until we know more."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"I am inclined to agree. Should I come across any new information, I will send word to you right away."},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"There's a good chance this search will turn into something of a long-term effort. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I suggest you rest while you still can."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The next scholar quest will be available from Surito Carito upon reaching level 63."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The requirements for undertaking subsequent quests can be reviewed in your journal."}],"reward":{"gil":1873,"xp":167400},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":29}],"questsType":"all","quests":[67212,67895]},"next":[68460]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006757","obj":{"i":1006757,"n":"Alka Zolka","l":28,"q":11}},{"type":"npc","id":"1013135","obj":{"i":1013135,"n":"Surito Carito","l":34,"q":10}},{"type":"npc","id":"1009552","obj":{"i":1009552,"n":"Hunt Billmaster","l":28,"s":4,"q":2,"r":1,"a":1802,"c":[13.17,12.46]}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021903","obj":{"i":1021903,"n":"Sunbaked Sailor","l":42,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021904","obj":{"i":1021904,"n":"Alka Zolka","l":42,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1021918","obj":{"i":1021918,"n":"Alka Zolka","l":34,"q":2}},{"type":"quest","id":"67212","obj":{"i":67212,"n":"Forward, the Royal Marines","g":156,"l":"Upper La Noscea","s":600,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67895","obj":{"i":67895,"n":"The Far Edge of Fate","g":5,"l":"Gridania","s":19}},{"type":"quest","id":"68460","obj":{"i":68460,"n":"A Safe Place to Hide","g":156,"l":"Upper La Noscea","s":630,"f":1}}]}
