Yes, yes you'll do quite nicely."},{"name":"ZUZUDESU","text":"Zuzudesu's the name, and sutler for the Resistance is my trade. And you are an adventurer, are you not? If you're as well-traveled as you seem, then you must know where this conversation is going."},{"name":"ZUZUDESU","text":"I was making a routine shipment here to Ala Ghiri, when a band of Qiqirn attacked my wagon and relieved me of all my wares."},{"name":"ZUZUDESU","text":"For a blessing the crates were rather heavy, so I doubt they were able to carry them far, if at all."},{"name":"ZUZUDESU","text":"Would you go and recover them for me? They'd be heading back to the Carmine Kitchen, but I doubt they could make it much farther than the abandoned Garlean outpost to the north."},{"name":"ZUZUDESU","text":"Be wary of the Qiqirn.

I deliver all manner of supplies, from the armor on their backs to the bread in their bellies. The last thing we need is them marching into battle with empty hands or stomachs."},{"name":"ZUZUDESU","text":"And I would be to blame! Why, if you hadn't recovered those crates, I would have had no choice but to flee under the cover of night. Perhaps even assume a new identity.
