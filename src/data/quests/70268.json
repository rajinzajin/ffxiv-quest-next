Unable to choose from the swarm of ideas in her head, she realizes that you, the tool's wielder, may be able to provide the clearest direction for the augmentations. Your answer encourages her to make use of an adaptive substance similar to dark matter, the acquisition of which once more entails the preparation of quality trade goods.<br><br>※Please note that you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Thanks to Grenoldt's dream-inspired oil, the infusion of adaptive materials has successfully enhanced the splendorous tool even further.

My head becomes a confused jumble and I can't decide which one I should choose."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"That's just proof o' yer growth as an artisan. If ye've learned so many techniques that ye can't pick a direction for yer piece, then maybe ye need to ask the opinion o' the bugger what's been wieldin' it."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Of course...

There are materials like dark matter which have adaptive properties─some have even been known to react to a person's thoughts and emotions."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"If we could lay our hands on a high-quality substance like that, and succeed in bonding it to the grip... Then we may very well realize the artisan-attuned instrument I always dreamed of crafting!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Aye, that's the kind of answer I was lookin' for. Now that we've got a clearer picture o' where we're headin', I can make the adjustments to me designs."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Still, a high-purity material what acts like dark matter is not an easy ask─even for the likes o' Boutique procurers.

I hope this stuff doesn't react to <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> emotions!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"A “psychosensitive substance,” the scholars call it. It'll be me first time havin' summat o' this purity put to use in a craftin' design, so I'm pretty bloody curious to see how it turns out."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Right. We have the tool, the materials, and─fate willing─the talent. Bide here a while, and we'll be back with an even more splendid masterpiece!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"(-Grenoldt-)Stand back! Here comes the finishing touch!!!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"We did it! The splendorous tool has evolved once more!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"I really must ask, though, Master Grenoldt... What <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span> that divine liquid with which you so reverently anointed our work?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Oho... Well that, me young disciple, is the distilled essence o' me craftsmanship! A finishin' coat of oil what contains not one drop of impurity!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"The perfect way to seal the tool's surface!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"And this is the perfect time for you to show it off, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

An' it seems right comfortable there in yer hand, like ye was born to hold it!"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Chora-Zoi, I'd say ye've made yer wish come true─a tool what adapts itself to its wielder. I'm proud to be yer mentor."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"As for you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I hope ye enjoy the new improvements. The tool should pick up on yer passion for the trade, an' from time to time ye'll find it amplifies yer mastery."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Just a little bonus from usin' “psychosensitive” materials...an' how the effect manifests through me finishin' oil."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"And here I thought it was just a protective layer... Where does the inspiration for such revolutionary ideas come from?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"From a bloody odd dream, in this case. I saw myself toiling over an anvil─naught too strange there─but I was bald as a boulder."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Then some beefy gentleman strides in an' douses me whole body in oil! The shock of it must've knocked me out o' bed, 'cause I woke up on the floor. That's when it dawned on me to coat our tool in the same way."},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"Greetings, my hardworking friends. Quinnana reports that your tool crafting is proceeding apace!

I should like naught more than to continue this fruitful alliance, and stimulate the growth of industry with your wondrous creations."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Aye, things are already changin'. Until recent times, the art o' craftin' an' tradin' was just a means to stave off the fall o' society for one more day, but that age is comin' to an end."},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Now's our chance to build a richer an' better world─together!"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"You and I...together!?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"I... You... I meant the Boutique! An' Chora-Zoi! An' the Warrior o' Darkness! All of us, in a general sense!"},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Cheers to that! Shall we stop by the Wandering Stairs and raise a glass in celebration?"},{"name":"GRENOLDT","text":"Ah, I appreciate the invitation, lass, but no brew ever passes these lips. I'd prefer to linger here a while─ye know, go over me designs an' make plans for future adjustments."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"No rest for the master craftsman!"},{"name":"MOWEN","text":"Hee hee! Even after ten years, some things never change."},{"name":"CHORAZOI","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.
