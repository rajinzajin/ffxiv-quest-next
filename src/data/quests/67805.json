Sales have continued to soar and to prevent exhausting their limited supply, the Vath have begun cultivating their own. While their fields have grown thick with these herbs, most of their plants do not have as potent a smell as those found in the wild. Sending an inferior product to their customers would tarnish the guild's good name, so it is decided each bundle must pass a test. The Vath keeneye hands you a bunch of these herbs and asks that you help them evaluate the quality of their plants. Take the silver dew and speak with the Vath kintamer.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","The Vath kintamer mumbles and grumbles about the current state of their crops as he helps you climb onto a kongamato and load it with your silver dew. While he is clearly distraught, he seems hopeful that you will bring back good news. Now that you are securely mounted, fly to the Smoldering Wastes and find a dragon to test your dew on.<br><br>※Simply by speaking with the Vath kintamer you will be able to mount the kongamato.","The wyvern is disgusted by the silver dew and hurries to escape, but your job is still far from over. Follow him.","You once again shower the defenseless dragon in silver dew spray. Upset that you have not only attacked him for a second time, but that the putrid stench has also invaded his mouth and eyes, he takes flight and disappears from sight. Pursue him to test your dew for the last time.","As you douse him with the silver dew spray for a final time, the wyvern gasps for breath. In between fits of coughing he makes it very clear that should you follow him again, he will not hesitate to dismember you. Return to Loth ast Vath and report your success to the Vath keeneye.","The Vath keeneye is very pleased to add another batch of silver dew to the crates being delivered to the Convictory. He tells you that he has high hopes for the future, believing that with time and effort they should one day be able to fill a majority of their orders with silver dew from their own fields."],"objectives":["Speak with the Vath kintamer.","Ride the kongamato and use its Fumigate ability on the wyvern.","Use the kongamato's Fumigate ability on the wyvern once more.","Use the kongamato's Fumigate ability on the wyvern for a third time.","Report to the Vath keeneye."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SEARCHER","text":"Adventurer, our guild's silver dew is popular.
