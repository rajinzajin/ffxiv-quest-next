So here's my proposal: we'll pay you to provide us with a supplementary supply."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"Have a word to Shigitt, and he'll load you up with whatever scrap materials you need!"},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"You're here to help make more targets? Well, thank Watts's beard for that. I swear they were about to start in on the ale casks..."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Take this lot. Should be enough to make three or so scrap metal dummies, but Ronitt's automaton has more if you need it."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Take this lot. Should be enough to make three decent-sized wooden dummies, but Ronitt's automaton has more if you need it."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"Take this lot. Should be enough to make three big blocks of gelatin─perfect for gauging explosive power. You can pick up more materials from Ronitt's automaton if you need them."},{"name":"SHIGITT","text":"As soon as they're ready, I want you to haul those targets over to our bombardier at the Stay.

That should tide us over for a little while."},{"name":"REGITT","text":"At first we were using automata as targets, but it was a bugger of a job putting them back together after a direct hit.
