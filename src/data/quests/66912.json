Concerned that this incident will be the catalyst that triggers a full military campaign against the Sahagin, the clutchfather urges you to make haste to the deck of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span> to save its crew. Speak with Pahh, the seabeast tamer, and borrow an elbst to carry you across the waves.","After a swift, albeit somewhat wet, journey on the back of the elbst, you pull yourself over the rails of the beleaguered <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span>. Speak with the captain of the craft and learn how you might best assist the crew.","The captain of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span> bids you take the fight to the Sahagin while his men finish launching the lifeboats. Slay five of the enemies on board and give the captain and his crew the time they need to escape.","You have slain a fistful of the Coral Trident raiders. Return to the captain and check on the crew's progress.","Thanks to your valiant efforts, the entire crew of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span> has managed to flee to Aleport in relatively good health. Find the captain in the port town's tavern and learn how he fares.","While recounting the first moments of the attack on his ship, the captain makes mention of the Tridents' supposed leader─a “red-hued sea devil.” Upon overhearing the story, a Maelstrom officer by the name of Ururu Kogururu urges the unhappy trader to recall the specific color. The Lalafellin lieutenant is visibly taken aback at the answer. Ururu goes on to explain that the Scarlet Sea Devil was a particularly savage Sahagin pirate that terrorized the seas of western La Noscea more than fifteen years ago. At the culmination of his chilling tale, the lieutenant departs to report the disturbing revelation to his superior.<br><br>Lamenting the loss of his vessel and livelihood, but thankful for his life, the captain of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span> gifts you with a sack of oranges he managed to salvage from the hold. Return to Novv's Nursery and share your reward with Novv and the spawnlings.","After Novv praises you for your actions in saving the crew, you relinquish the sack of oranges to the clutchfather and his curious offspring. The elder Sahagin muses on the differences between your peoples, and provides some insight into the Coral Tridents' rise to prominence. Continue to offer your aid to Novv's Clutch and deepen your understanding of the Sahagin tribe."],"objectives":["Speak with Pahh.","Speak with the captain of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span>.","Defeat Coral Trident raiders aboard the <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span>.","Speak with the captain of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span>.","Speak with the captain of the <span class=\"emphasis\">Swallow</span> in Aleport.","Share the oranges with Novv at Novv's Nursery."],"dialogue":[{"name":"NOVV","text":"Pshhh...
