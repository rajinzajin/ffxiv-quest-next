Make your preparations without delay, and signal your readiness to begin the mission to the waiting Hozan.","With the aid of Alphinaud and Yugiri, you have succeeded in rescuing Raubahn from the clutches of the traitorous Crystal Braves. Make your way back outside to eastern Thanalan.","You emerge in the hot desert air. Speak with Doware, who awaits your return.","Outside Halatali, you are approached by a messenger, who claims that his mistress is sympathetic to your cause. For your own safety, he bids you make your way to the Waking Sands. Speak with Alphinaud to learn what he thinks of this mysterious invitation.","Alphinaud is sufficiently convinced that the messenger and his mistress can be trusted. Do as bade and make your way to western Thanalan, where your old haunt the Waking Sands still stands.","Upon arriving at the Waking Sands, you are greeted by a number of familiar faces─Urianger, Pipin, and Papashan. Soon after, it is revealed that the messenger's mistress is no less an individual than Dewlala, head of the Order of Nald'thal and member of the Syndicate. To Raubahn's immense relief, she confirms Alphinaud's suspicion that Nanamo is still alive, and goes on to speculate that the sultana may be confined somewhere in a state of induced slumber. Trouble Alphinaud for his thoughts on these revelations.","Alphinaud thanks you for your part in Raubahn's rescue. With the Flame General safe, your work in Ul'dah is done for now."],"objectives":["Speak with Hozan.","Speak with Doware in front of Halatali.","Speak with Alphinaud.","Enter the Waking Sands.","Speak with Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HOUZAN","text":"There is no time to lose─General Aldynn may be executed at any moment.
