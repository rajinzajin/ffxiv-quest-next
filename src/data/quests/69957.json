Stop."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Now then, our friend Hermes. Aside from overseeing the facility, he also conducts his own research."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Chances are he will be at the main observation hub, so let us seek him out there first."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Attired as you are, however, you stand out a little too much. Our dear Emet-Selch wishes to keep a low profile for his errand, so..."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Do you know how to make a robe? The basic concept will do."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"No? In that case, Emet-Selch─"},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"No. Your whim, your responsibility. You're getting not another thimble of aether out of me."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; The way he scrimps sometimes, you'd think he <span class=\"emphasis\">wasn't</span> a nigh-bottomless font of magic..."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Very well, I shall make the robe, but perhaps you can assist. Come, let us search for the requisite material."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"No means no. Just be grateful I'm even willing to wait."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Yes, these creatures should suffice."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"An aetheric rope. I want you to use it to capture, shall we say, two petaloudai."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"There are three species here, I believe. Any two different kinds should serve."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Now, I should mention that the strength of the rope is tied─no pun intended─to the strength of its user."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"As your aether is still thin compared to ours, you'll need to weaken the petaloudai first. Good luck!"},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Remember, it's a pair of petaloudai we require. Any two different kinds should serve."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"You've caught the petaloudai? Come, come, let us see."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Yes, these fine fellows will do nicely. And now for a spot of reversion..."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"...There! It's ready!"},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"It's nothing fancy, but then we're trying <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> to stand out. Try it on for size."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You turn living beings into clothing? Just like that?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Won't someone be angry with us for using those creatures?"},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Well, not <span class=\"emphasis\">just</span> like that. You need to revert them to their constituent aether first."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Lest you wonder why I asked for two species, it is due to the difference in their aetheric balance. Blending them allows us to produce garb with superior aetheric stability."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Oh, it's fine, there's no one around to tell us off. And besides, we can always make more petaloudai. They need only a tiny amount of aether."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"It may take some effort to get the form and composition right, but anyone familiar with the concept should be able to manage."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Well and good to disguise <span class=\"emphasis\">and</span> educate it, but it won't fool anyone who can see worth a damn."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Fair point, but at the very least it should spare you unwanted attention from casual observers."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Emet-Selch speaks true. Even dressed like us, your unusual nature will be plain to those who think to look."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Should someone question your presence, don't make up excuses, much less try to explain what you actually are. No, best to simply say that you're a familiar."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"The question is <span class=\"emphasis\">whose</span>..."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"Ah, of course─Azem's. If you say you belong to <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>, people will give you the benefit of the doubt for any and all outlandish behavior."},{"name":"EMETSELCH","text":"Exploiting our associate's absence?"},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"For lack of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> presence, absolutely. Were <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> here, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span>'d have been the first to propose the idea─and you know it."},{"name":"HYTHLODAEUS","text":"With that, your story is settled.
