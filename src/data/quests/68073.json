And so a great host, led by General Aldynn and Commander Kemp, laid siege to the towers. But when the massive cannon at Castrum Abania was used to destroy the main tower of Specula Imperatoris, killing countless Allied and imperial troops, it was plain the rules of engagement had changed...","You struggle to keep up with Alisaie as she runs towards what is left of Specula Imperatoris. Desperate to find her brother, she pushes through the gates before you can even think to stop her.","Though Alphinaud and many others are nowhere to be seen, you find General Aldynn and Marshal Tarupin in the thick of things, bellowing orders left and right, in a bid to organize their forces' withdrawal.

Though the others escaped with only minor injuries, the grizzled commander's are unquestionably mortal. He uses his final moments to implore Lyse to succeed him as leader of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, and she tearfully accepts, promising to lead their countrymen to freedom. Safe in the knowledge that his legacy is secure, Conrad Kemp smiles and breathes his last.","Alphinaud is incensed, swearing bloody vengeance for Conrad's death and the indiscriminate slaughter at Specula Imperatoris. For indeed, what manner of monster would order the death of his own..."],"objectives":["Follow Alisaie.","Speak with Raubahn.","Search for wounded soldiers in need of assistance.","Continue searching for wounded soldiers.","Speak with Lyse.","Speak with Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"This way!
