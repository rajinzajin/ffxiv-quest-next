We've sent out scouts to ascertain his whereabouts, but they're few in number. Might you aid in their efforts?"},{"name":"MOLSOLDIER04230","text":"Your cooperation is much appreciated. I bid you begin your search near the Senaculum Imperialis. Our fellows have yet to explore it."},{"name":"MOLSOLDIER04230","text":"Should any tempered imperial forces attempt to waylay you, I ask that you merely subdue them─<span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> kill them. To that end, I offer you this powder. It shall render any hostile immobile for a time."},{"name":"MOLSOLDIER04230","text":"The tempered imperial forces that stalk these city streets are to be pitied. They did not choose their fate, after all. I ask that you spare any you find─Garlemald has experienced enough bloodshed for many, many lifetimes..."},{"name":"INJUREDSOLDIER04230","text":"I certainly did not expect you of all people to come to my rescue! And you are arrived just in the nick of time... Had you come any later, I fear you may have been forced to carry a load of dead weight back to camp."},{"name":"INJUREDSOLDIER04230","text":"I was on my rounds when I heard what I assumed to be a refugee crying for help. I made to aid the poor soul when some imperial wretch set upon me. Looking at it with a more critical eye, that “refugee” may have been nothing but bait for a trap."},{"name":"INJUREDSOLDIER04230","text":"My head was muddled from the chaos of it all, but I swear I heard the man speak the name “Lord Nerva.” If my ears did not deceive me, this would mean remnants of the IIIrd Legion are still abroad, and they perhaps aim to fleece us of both provisions and arms."},{"name":"INJUREDSOLDIER04230","text":"That deserter must be brought in for questioning before the effects of that compound of yours wears off. I shall return to the station at once to report in and ensure that our forces have captured the scoundrel."},{"name":"MOLSOLDIER04230","text":"There you are, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I have been awaiting your return. Our comrade reported in just moments ago, and I have heard all. Not only did you save him from the hands of that imperial, but you provided us the opportunity for his capture."},{"name":"MOLSOLDIER04230","text":"The men I sent out to apprehend that blackguard have sent word that he is <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> in fact tempered as we had assumed. Rather, he's one of many who are determined to fight until the bitter end. As invaders in their lands, we've drawn their ire."},{"name":"MOLSOLDIER04230","text":"I have my fair share of misgivings about any who fight under the imperial standard, but considering the circumstances...surely it would be in the interest of both sides to lay down our weapons─to make at least an attempt at cooperation."},{"name":"MOLSOLDIER04230","text":"But such idle musings can be saved for less troublous times, I suppose. Oh yes, how foolish of me─I nearly forgot. The fellow you saved earlier, he asked me to give you this as thanks for your help."}],"reward":{"gil":815},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69929]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1040645","obj":{"i":1040645,"n":"Mol Delegate","l":3710,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69929","obj":{"i":69929,"n":"Strange Bedfellows","g":11,"l":"Garlemald","s":547}}]}
