Even though he wants nothing more than to improve, it seems his fear of losing control once again is keeping him from fighting with all his strength. In order to serve as an example to Curious Gorge, and future warriors, Broken Mountain tells you to follow in Mythril Heart's footsteps by hunting the fearsome grizzly bears inhabiting Abalathia's Spine. Go to Tailfeather in the Dravanian forelands and ask the hunters there for any information that might help you track down these colossal creatures.","The hunters at Tailfeather share stories of the massive grizzlies, none of them encouraging. One hunter begrudgingly informs you that some have been known to lure the bears out with Whilom salmon, which can be found at the northwestern part of the Whilom River. Go to the riverbanks and gather any fish you can find.","The hunter's advice was sound, and you have found enough fish to draw one of the beasts out from hiding. Go to the Hundred Throes and use the Whilom salmon to draw a grizzly out, then slay one of them in its watering hole.","You have defeated a fearsome Whilom grizzly, as Mythril Heart before you, and the pitched battle awakens your inner beast from its slumber. Return to Camp Bronze Lake and inform Broken Mountain of your deeds.","Upon returning to Camp Bronze Lake, Curious Gorge enthusiastically informs you of the Maelstrom's successful defense against the kobold attacks, and returns to train for his next mission. However, Wheiskaet has a different story. Although the operation succeeded, it seems Curious Gorge remains frightened of losing control in battle. With the beast tribes growing bolder by the day, there is little hope for the Maelstrom to take warriors seriously if Curious Gorge continues to underperform. Broken Mountain will continue to do research into how to tame the inner beast and encourages you to continue your training in preparation for the next step.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Broken Mountain upon reaching level 56."],"objectives":["Speak with the hunters at Tailfeather.","Obtain Whilom salmon from the designated location.","Use the salmon at the designated location and slay the bear.","Report to Broken Mountain at Camp Bronze Lake."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"Well met, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. It seems your trials have prepared you for the next step down your long path."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"However, while <span class=\"emphasis\">your</span> progress is truly remarkable, I'm afraid my brother still fears the fury of his inner beast. Even in the training yard, he swings his axe with hesitation."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"Seeking to test himself against live foes, he has joined the Maelstrom's efforts to repel a recent spate of kobold attacks. However, Wheiskaet has sent word that his ferocity on the field of battle is not what it once was."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"My brother has long admired your will. Test your axe against ever stronger adversaries and master the techniques of eld, and by doing so serve to inspire him and all who aspire to walk the path of the warrior."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"Remember the words set forth in the ancient tomes, and seek foes that test the very limits of your mind and body. The heat of battle will awaken the beast within, bestowing upon you the knowledge of our ancestors."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"Luckily, the path you walk has been tread on before, and you need not wander the land aimlessly. According to the tomes, Mythril Heart once spent a season hunting the hulking grizzly bears that stalk Abalathia's Spine, the largest of which are said to rival even a behemoth in size."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"Make your way to Tailfeather, home to many seasoned hunters that know the lay of the land and of the creatures inhabiting it. Find the beasts of Mythril Heart's hunt and test yourself against their razor claws as he did."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"The techniques of eld are within your grasp, but only if you can transcend the limits of your mind and body."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"Each meeting with you, I'm humbled anew. I'll continue my own training, so that one day we may meet as peers."},{"name":"REMACLON","text":"Ask any hunter 'round here about the grizzlies of Abalathia's Spine and they're like to tell you the same thing: if you see one, run."},{"name":"REMACLON","text":"Plenty o' green adventurers come 'round here asking about the beasts of Abalathia's Spine. Few come back from their hunt."},{"name":"LOUISONET","text":"Aye, I can hardly forget the size of the beast I saw that day. I was tracking a chocobo 'round the Hundred Throes, when I spotted a bear near big as a house, drinkin' its fill from the waters. I didn't dare get any closer, and went home from that day's hunt empty-handed."},{"name":"LOUISONET","text":"You can't convince me to go back to the Hundred Throes again, even if there was a whole herd of chocobos over there."},{"name":"PRIORFAIX","text":"You're a right fool if you're thinkin' of goin' after one of those massive beasts alone─best bring about a dozen friends along if you wanna come back in one piece."},{"name":"PRIORFAIX","text":"If you've got the men, then I've heard of huntin' parties usin' Whilom salmon to draw 'em out. If you head up the Whilom River, you're like to find a few what died durin' the salmon run."},{"name":"PRIORFAIX","text":"Some of the huntin' parties comin' through here have used Whilom salmon to lure out the beasts."},{"name":"PRIORFAIX","text":"'Course, once you lure one out, then you've gotta kill it. Can't give you much advice on that part."},{"name":"WHEISKAET","text":"Broken Mountain told me of the daring hunt you set out upon. I'd like to hear about it─sounds like it's the type of story that'll get our blood flowing!"},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"Wheiskaet and I have just returned from our duties in La Noscea. The cowardly kobolds never stood a chance! A dip in the hot springs seems a just reward for our bravery."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, welcome back. My brother and Wheiskaet were just telling me of the Maelstrom's successes in La Noscea."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"Aye, the kobolds scattered as frightened mice before our wrath. I daresay they'll think twice before setting foot on Lominsan soil again!"},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, as eager as I am to hear of your journey to Abalathia's Spine, I can't afford to waste any more time away from my training. The kobolds may be licking their wounds for now, but they'll be back, and in greater numbers. Till next we meet."},{"name":"WHEISKAET","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Curious Gorge has acted in high spirits since our return from Limsa Lominsa, but his bravado scarcely hides the truth."},{"name":"WHEISKAET","text":"What he said was true─our operations against the kobolds were a resounding success. However, troops that fought alongside him say that Curious Gorge was noticeably shaken during the battle, as if afraid the tide would turn at a moment's notice."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"But it was not fear of the kobolds that caused his axe to waver. He still fears his own inner beast. As long as this fear has hold of him in battle, then there is little hope that he will grow as a warrior..."},{"name":"WHEISKAET","text":"The kobolds become bolder with each passing day, and the Maelstrom's forces are spread too thin. Maelstrom Command is desperately seeking ways to supplement its flagging troops."},{"name":"WHEISKAET","text":"They're considering bolstering fighting strength by training troops in warrior techniques, so Curious Gorge's capabilities have come under special scrutiny. However, if fear continues to hold him back, I doubt he'll manage to impress anyone."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"Once again, we are left wanting for a means to tame the inner beast..."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"...<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, was there naught learned from your journey to the Dravanian forelands that could be of aid?"},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"...Ah, and in the same manner as before, the memories of battle have roused the inner beast."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"So my theory was correct: the key to mastery lies in the heat of conflict. Just as the ancient tomes say, only victory against a worthy opponent can temper the inner beast."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, your growth as a warrior has given us valuable insight into the true nature of the inner beast. However, there is still much that remains shrouded in mystery."},{"name":"WHEISKAET","text":"And there's still the question of what exactly sets <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> apart from your brother."},{"name":"BROKENMOUNTAIN","text":"Indeed. The tools to tame the beast within are hidden somewhere─I just have yet to find them. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, continue with your training while I return to the tomes. A solution will present itself soon enough!"}],"reward":{"gil":1497,"action":3549,"xp":62400},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":54,"id":22}],"quests":[66122]},"next":[66132]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1013279","obj":{"i":1013279,"n":"Broken Mountain","l":34,"q":7}},{"type":"npc","id":"1006266","obj":{"i":1006266,"n":"Wheiskaet","l":32,"q":20}},{"type":"npc","id":"1006746","obj":{"i":1006746,"n":"Curious Gorge","l":32,"q":15}},{"type":"npc","id":"1011919","obj":{"i":1011919,"n":"Remaclon","l":2000,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1011920","obj":{"i":1011920,"n":"Louisonet","l":2000,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1011921","obj":{"i":1011921,"n":"Priorfaix","l":2000,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1014473","obj":{"i":1014473,"n":"Curious Gorge","l":34,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1014474","obj":{"i":1014474,"n":"Wheiskaet","l":34,"q":3}},{"type":"action","id":"3549","obj":{"i":3549,"n":"Fell Cleave","c":2557,"j":21,"t":3,"l":54}},{"type":"quest","id":"66122","obj":{"i":66122,"n":"Duty and the Beast","g":149,"l":"Upper La Noscea","s":520,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"66132","obj":{"i":66132,"n":"Pirates of Shallow Water","g":149,"l":"Upper La Noscea","s":560,"f":1}}]}
