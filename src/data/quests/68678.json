It seems that trouble is once again brewing in Saint Mocianne's Arboretum and you are the person most qualified to handle it. Not wanting Sawney to have made a wasted journey, you agree to meet him in the Dravanian hinterlands.","Sawney is soon joined by Midnight Dew, who has a grime-covered korpokkur in tow. The Idyllshire residents explain that this seedkin emerged from the Arboretum exhibiting erratic behavior, which local botanist Edgyth attributes to the layer of mud covering it from top to bottom. This strange substance seems to invigorate plant life, a property Midnight Dew believes could prove beneficial in efforts to cultivate produce in Greengrub Mudplots. Unfortunately, it also affects the korpokkur's more bellicose brethren in a similar fashion, rendering the inner reaches of the Arboretum a potential death trap for anyone foolhardy enough to enter. Ever eager to lend your assistance, you make ready to venture forth and whack some weeds.<br><br>※Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","After contending with the sweltering humidity and cutting swaths through the flesh-eating foliage, you emerge from the Arboretum victorious yet desperate for a bath. But before you can call it a day, one final task remains: You must report news of your triumph to Sawney.","Following your successful expedition into the deepest recesses of the Arboretum, Midnight Dew and Edgyth were able to carry out a thorough investigation of the mysterious, vitality-bestowing mud. Research materials found within reveal the Sharlayans had created a concoction that acts as a catalyst in the decomposition of plant matter into nutrient-rich compost. Having discovered the secret of the ooze, Edgyth is confident that she can use these findings to revitalize the depleted soil around Idyllshire. Perhaps it will not be long before the locals enjoy the fruits─and vegetables─of your labor."],"objectives":["Rendezvous with Sawney at Saint Mocianne's Arboretum.","Enter Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard).

The place hasn't been the same without you!"},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"You're probably wonderin' why I sent Sawney to fetch you. It's all down to this mucky little korpokkur."},{"name":"SAWNEY","text":"When I saw it come boundin' out of the Arboretum, the first thing I noticed, besides it being covered in grime, was how bleedin' lively the little sod seemed to be."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"We had our old friend Edgyth take a look at it, and she reckons that layer of mud is what's makin' it so excitable."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"It's got this daft seedkin jumpin' around like a mad poroggo, so imagine what it could do for our crops at Greengrub Mudplots! And that's where you come in."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"There should be more of this gunk inside the Arboretum, but we have one small problem─ It also affects the more troublesome species of flora, makin' them downright lethal."},{"name":"SAWNEY","text":"We want to send Edgyth to look into it, but it's not safe with a bunch of botanist-eatin' plants makin' a nuisance of themselves. What say you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? Fancy givin' them a bit of prunin'?"},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"Sawney managed to track you down, did he?

I got out a few moments ago, but I won't be goin' back in any time soon!"},{"name":"SAWNEY","text":"I saw that you'd cleared a path for Midnight Dew and Edgyth, though.

Perhaps Sawney or Midnight Dew mentioned me? Or perhaps not... Anyway, I'm very grateful to you for helping us discover the secret of that bizarre ooze."},{"name":"EDGYTH","text":"You see, the research materials we found mention a concoction for rapidly turning plant matter into compost. It seems the mud was used to cultivate the ingredients for the formula."},{"name":"EDGYTH","text":"There was just one minor oversight. And by minor, I mean “quite major,” actually. This mud also causes alarming behavioral swings in seedkin, making them go positively berserk!"},{"name":"EDGYTH","text":"According to the Sharlayan reports... Well, I'll spare you the details of its botanical jargon. Let's just say the mud makes seedkin, in a word, angry."},{"name":"SAWNEY","text":"Growth formula for plants is all well and good, unless they're the sort that's liable to bite your bloody head off."},{"name":"EDGYTH","text":"Yes, I'm surprised the Sharlayans didn't keep it in a safer place. In any case, we can use their findings to breathe new life into the soil of Dravania. As for the seedkin, a little water washes the mud right off.
