Scour the beach for these mysterious missives, and bring what you find back to her, that she might share with you the contents.<br><br>※There are eighteen unique messages to be read in all, divided amongst three varieties of bottles. There are six unique messages contained in small bottles, seven messages contained in medium bottles, and five messages contained in large bottles. The letters housed in small and medium bottles will be chosen at random. Those in large bottles will vary depending on your progression through the main scenario.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You come upon one of the enigmatic messages in a bottle from the sands of Bloodshore. Taking it safely in hand, you begin to stride back toward P'obyano, eager to reveal the words housed within.","Upon delivering the bottle to P'obyano, the Faire attendant promptly extracts the message and suggests you read it in a quiet spot. Though the sender has decided to obscure their precise identity, the letter is clearly a message of gratitude from one of the many individuals you have touched through your adventures. Heartened to know that your deeds have made an impact on the wider world around you, you stride off with renewed purpose. Should you be curious as to the contents of the remaining bottles, you need only speak to P'obyano and offer your assistance once more."],"objectives":["Retrieve a message in a bottle from the beach.","Deliver the message in a bottle to P'obyano."],"dialogue":[{"name":"POBYANO","text":"After all you've already done, you're still willing to lend poor P'obyano a helping hand?

I couldn't blame you for that─I am too!"},{"name":"POBYANO","text":"Anyhow, what with how many of them are washing in these days, I don't suppose they'll be too hard to find. Bring back to me what you've found, and I'll open them right up─my nails are quite suited for the task, mind you─so you can read the message at your leisure."},{"name":"POBYANO","text":"Have you found any of the bottled messages yet? It shouldn't be hard─why, there's so many of them that sometimes I feel like I'm tripping over one every other second! If you find one, just bring it back to me.

For doing your part to clean up the beach, I'm more than happy to furnish you with this spiffy, shiny, absolutely official Rising token."},{"name":"POBYANO","text":"You'll want to hold on to it─and acquire even more, if you can─so that you can exchange them for any of the wide array of exclusive festival goods and accessories available from our vendor."},{"name":"POBYANO","text":"In the meantime, why don't you take the letter and find a quiet spot around here to read it? I imagine that gazing up at the fireworks over the sea would do an excellent job of setting the scene. Whoever wrote this, and wherever they are, no doubt they want nothing more than for their words to reach an adventurer like you."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter I-)How quickly the years have flown by since we first set up that message board on an unassuming street corner. Seeing the many and myriad words written there each day never fails to fill our hearts with joy and gratitude."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter I-)Perhaps most enjoyable of all to read are the announcements of various festivities organized by adventurers. Gatherings of fellow clansmen, adventurous journeys to far-flung lands, and all sorts of delightful events."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter I-)We tip our caps to the passionate adventurers who pour their heart and soul into organizing these outings. One might liken them to a lodestone, drawing people in and bringing like minds together wherever they go."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter I-)Finally, we would express our thanks to all of you who take the time to keep diaries of your journeys. It is a pleasure and an honor both to have the privilege of sharing in your adventures.<br>With best wishes,<br>The Keepers of the Message Boards "},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter II-)We hear that these days, it's all the rage for adventurers to gather in small groups and paint portraits of themselves striking stylish poses."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter II-)As humble art supply provisioners, all we can do is provide the canvas, the palette, the paint, and the brush by which such works of art can be crafted. And we realize there is much we still must do to allow adventurers to fully realize their aesthetic visions."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter II-)And yet, seeing the masterworks you are already creating each day instills us with pride and the passion to continue pursuing our craft."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter II-)We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for allowing us to take part in this creative collaboration, and look forward to providing you with yet more materials to add to your artist's workshop in the future.<br>Wishing you eternal inspiration,<br>The Art Provisioners of Eorzea"},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter III-)The other day at the aetheryte plaza, I happened upon a minstrel cheerfully strumming a tune before an admiring crowd of adventurers and townspeople."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter III-)Impromptu concerts like these have been happening more and more of late, and I daresay nothing fills our hearts with joy quite like seeing people of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life bonding over a love of music."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter III-)To all the talented composers and instrumentalists out there, we thank you for providing a soundtrack to stir our own hearts. We hope that the music of Eorzea has served to render your adventures even richer and more memorable.<br>Ever in harmony with you,<br>A Humble Instrument-maker"},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter IV-)I still remember the day. Fresh off the boat after a long voyage across the Ruby Sea, I strode into the gleaming Gold Saucer. I found an open space in one of the parlors, set up my table, and began to stack my tiles atop it."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter IV-)Anxiety gripped me to the depths of my body and soul. What if Eorzeans had no interest in the Doman diversion I sought to provide? Would my long journey prove to be for naught?"},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter IV-)Fortunately, my worries soon melted away. Within hours, the Manderville Tables were teeming with visitors─locals and travelers from far abroad alike─each more eager than the next to try their hand at the time-honored game of mahjong."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter IV-)I am no mighty adventurer, and there is only so much I can do for this realm. And so I hope that, in some small way, the game I teach can serve to lighten adventurers' days, and relieve them from the many burdens they bear.<br>Until we meet at the tables,<br>An Anonymous Mahjong Tutor"},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter I-)The mighty walls of Ul'dah were not built by one man. There were those that hewed the stones, and those that polished them. Those that carried them, and those that stacked them one atop the other until they reached the towering height you see today..."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter I-)And it is not just the walls. Much of what you see in the world is, in fact, the sum total of the blood, sweat, and tears of countless men and women whose names and faces you will never see."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter I-)But there is one more who is essential to truly realize the creation of these wonders...and that is you. For without you, all the efforts of those nameless artisans would mean nothing at all."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter I-)And so we speak in unison when we say...thank you. Always remember that you are the reason we devote ourselves to our craft.<br>With gratitude,<br>The Nameless Artisans of Eorzea"},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter V-)Lately, there is nothing I enjoy quite so much as walking the streets of Eorzea's residential districts, and stopping to admire the many homes open for public viewing."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter V-)Seeing the furnishings my colleagues and I crafted with love and care tastefully adorning such warm and welcoming homes─oftentimes in remarkably creative ways─is perhaps the single most enjoyable sight an artisan can experience."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter V-)At times, the layouts are so eccentric and unconventional that I fear it is only a matter of time before they come crashing to the ground...but I am nonetheless impressed with the sheer creativity on display."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Small Bottle, Letter V-)As for us, we will do all in our power to continue crafting stylish furnishings and ornaments.

From white-veiled snowfields to exotic townscapes, and sometimes even to distant worlds..."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter IV-)Many a vista we have painted on our canvases, from familiar surroundings to far-flung locales. If even one or two of them have left an impression on you, there is nothing that would make us happier."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter IV-)And yet, all we can do is provide the backdrop─the stage on which you, the star of this adventure, will shine."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter IV-)From skies of azure and seas of ruby to the gentle darkness that comes after the light.

This, in turn, inspires me to not rest on my laurels, but rather to strive to create yet newer and more eclectic fashions."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter V-)So to you, who I may never meet, and whose name I may never know, I have only this to say: thank you from the bottom of my heart for allowing the clothes of my creation to walk with you.<br>Yours sincerely,<br>A Humble Fashion Designer"},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter VI-)A tale is not complete the instant the author pens the final word."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter VI-)No, it is not until the reader then takes the tome in hand, and the words enter their eyes, their heart...only then does the story told in those pages truly come to life."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter VI-)One could say that you are not only the protagonist of this grand tale of adventure, but also─in a sense─one of its authors. Your thoughts, your decisions, your actions─all serve to dictate the course of the story."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter VI-)And so we hope, that you will continue to enjoy with all your heart your adventures here.

After all, I'm just one of the humble artisans responsible for the show you saw today."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter VII-)To tell the truth, my colleagues and I are responsible for more than fireworks. Storms of pounding rain and bolts of lightning, auroras that dazzle in the sky, mystic lights and the glowing of crystals. The lights and mists that you see upon the stage are all crafted by our hands."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Medium Bottle, Letter VII-)Fireworks are a fleeting thing, are they not? They dazzle the eye and move the heart, but in the next instance they turn to smoke, then fade and vanish without a trace.

Though as you have proven, miracles can─and often do─happen.<br>Ever your comrade,<br>A Devoted Temple Knight"},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Large Bottle, Letter IV-)I'd been a member of the Resistance for years, not that we ever had much luck against the Garleans. It felt like we went from one defeat to the next, our numbers growing smaller each time."},{"name":"BOTTLELETTER","text":"(-Large Bottle, Letter IV-)But that all changed when you and the Alliance arrived. Your brave deeds turned the tide not only here in Ala Mhigo, but all the way over in Doma, from what I've heard. I'll bet those imperials hardly knew what had hit them.
