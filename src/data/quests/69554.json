To that end, she bids you consult with young Isainne, whom the celebrant-in-chief has tasked with ensuring that the decorations in Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre are up to seasonal standards.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You arrive at the amphitheatre, where Isainne laments that her associate Kamlito Halito has once again failed to capture the spirit of the season─if the talk about town is to be believed. Follow her to the Shaded Bower to see precisely what might be the matter with the slipshod snowmen he made.","After a brief discussion with Isainne over by the Shaded Bower, you come to the conclusion that the snowmen all appear to be facing the wrong direction. Survey the scene and see if you can't set things straight.","A turn there, a twist here, and the snowmen now face a more intuitive direction, so as to welcome festival-goers to stores selling seasonal delights. Take pride in a job well done, and share your observations with young Isainne.","You report back to young Isainne, who is predictably overjoyed at seeing what you have done with the snowmen. Your rejoicing is interrupted, however, by the ever-abrasive Kamlito Halito, who looks down his nose at your efforts, defending the “efficiency” of his own work and proclaiming that the entire event would be more successful were he in charge. Insulted by his insinuations that Starlight is all about greed and receiving material goods, Isainne stomps off─leading the Saint of Nymeia to come to the scene and deliver his charge a good scolding. With hope that the youth might have learned his lesson this time, you return to Amh Garanjy to claim another hard-earned reward.","Back at the amphitheatre, Amh Garanjy offers her gratitude for your continued aid in preparing for the Starlight festivities, and bids you reward yourself for your efforts with yet another present from the twinklebox. She asks that you do not go far, however─much and more yet needs be done before the celebration can commence in earnest, and your further assistance would be more than appreciated."],"objectives":["Speak with Isainne.","Speak with Isainne again.","Straighten out the snowmen.","Speak with Isainne.","Report to Amh Garanjy and claim a present from the twinklebox."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"Getting presents is fun, too, but what I really enjoy is helping out and sharing the Starlight spirit!"},{"name":"AMHGARANJY","text":"I'm heartened to see you've decided to stick around. Apparently, there's another set of decorations that aren't quite up to snuff. Would you mind helping Isainne look into the matter and fix things up?

When I was on my way back before, some of the townspeople told me that there's something strange about the snowmen over by the Shaded Bower."},{"name":"ISAINNE","text":"Kamlito was in charge of those as well. I know that he's new to all this, but how hard can it be to make a snowman? Anyhow, let's go and see what's wrong, shall we?

I actually care about Starlight, and my decorations will put smiles on more faces than yours ever will!"},{"name":"KAMLITOHALITO","text":"Smiles this, happiness that.
