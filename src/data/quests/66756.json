With the Amalj'aa unable to approach the settlement without fear of igniting hostilities, it falls to you to broach the issue with Commander Gisilbehrt.","While confirming Commander Gisilbehrt's suspicions concerning the security breach in the settlement, you are interrupted by reports of an Amalj'aa attack on a travelers' caravan. Head south of Little Ala Mhigo, and rendezvous with the undermanned squad deployed by the commander.","One of the new flame recruits has revealed himself as a tempered spy. Accost the traitor, and learn what manner of scheme is afoot.","You have defeated the Flamefang soldiers. Turn your attention back to the flame recruit traitor.","Loonh Gah fells the fleeing traitor, only to join you in an Amalj'aa trap. The apparent leader of the ambush, Zagozz Teh, taunts the Miqo'te warrior, then easily defeats her as she attempts to loose an arrow at his heart. The raiders depart, sparing you to send a message to Hamujj Gah. First, however, you must return to Little Ala Mhigo and report events to Commander Gisilbehrt.","The Immortal Flames commander is stricken with guilt at the news of the betrayal, and begs you to rescue the surviving captives from the clutches of the Flamefangs. Return to the Ring of Ash, and seek the counsel of Hamujj Gah.","After explaining how each new tempered slave bolsters the strength of the enemy, the warleader bids you free those taken captive in the recent raid. Ambush the Amalj'aa gaolkeepers in the Zanr'ak encampment, and seize from them the keys to the captives' cages.","You have slain the gaolkeepers, and obtained a fistful of keys. Locate the makeshift cages within Zahar'ak and rescue the kidnapped victims from their captors.","You have succeeded in freeing the captives from their cages. Return to the Ring of Ash and report to Hamujj Gah.","Even as the warleader praises your efforts, an infuriated Loonh Gah stalks into the cave, promising a grisly demise to Zagozz Teh. Though Hamujj Gah rebukes the young warrior and her reckless plans, he offers no aid in bringing the Flamefang leader to justice. It seems that the Miqo'te is to find her own strength, and resolve her blood vendetta alone..."],"objectives":["Speak with Gisilbehrt in Little Ala Mhigo.","Speak with the flame recruit south of Little Ala Mhigo.","Speak with the flame recruit traitor and slay the Flamefangs.","Speak with the flame recruit traitor.","Report to Gisilbehrt in Little Ala Mhigo.","Return to Hamujj Gah at the Ring of Ash.","Ambush the Zanr'ak gaolkeepers in the Zanr'ak encampment and obtain the cage keys.","Use the cage keys to open the makeshift cages in Zahar'ak.","Report to Hamujj Gah."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"Fortune is with us, honored ally.

This cannot be allowed to continue! We must gouge out their hidden eyes, and blind them to the movements of their prey!"},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"You are no stranger to Little Ala Mhigo, I trust? Though it appears a haven for travelers and merchants, it is naught but a rotting corpse riddled with flame-addled maggots."},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"We are fortunate, then, that you may walk among them unchallenged. Go to Little Ala Mhigo, honored ally, and do that which our Amalj'aa soldiers cannot: root out the tempered, and make of it a haven in truth."},{"name":"GISILBEHRT","text":"...What's this? You claim Little Ala Mhigo has been infiltrated by tempered agents?"},{"name":"GISILBEHRT","text":"I wish I could refute you, but I have had my suspicions...

Ahahaha, that's rich!"},{"name":"FMUMETSUTAIA","text":"I have allies lingering nearby.

Meanwhile, I'll see what I can do to salvage the tatters of my command..."},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"I thank you for your report, honored ally. This Zagozz Teh you encountered is the fetid maw that drives the Flamefangs.
