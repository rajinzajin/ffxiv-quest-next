Do as the Antecedent bids and see if aught is amiss.","A clearly agitated Alphinaud informs you that Eline Roaille has somehow managed to slip her confines and escape. He believes that the disgraced flame marshal means to flee to her imperial masters at Castrum Meridianum. Make haste to Camp Bluefog in northern Thanalan, and join Ilberd and the 1st Unit in their hunt for the fugitive.","You arrive at Camp Bluefog to the news that Eline Roaille passed through scarcely a bell before. Follow Captain Ilberd to the nearby Ceruleum Processing Plant, the next notable landmark on the way to Castrum Meridianum.","You overtake Eline Roaille at Raubahn's Push, but not before she is joined by her imperial allies. Undeterred, you stand shoulder to shoulder with the Crystal Braves and the shinobi of Doma, and engage the enemy, succeeding at length in overwhelming the Garleans and recapturing the fugitive. Wholly unrepentant, Eline greets the subsequent arrival of Alphinaud with a hail of vitriol, and is lambasted by Ilberd for her shamelessness before being dragged away. Ask Alphinaud for his thoughts on the heated exchange.","Alphinaud seems troubled. Though the sordid business of the Ivy is concluded, it has plainly left an unpleasant taste in his mouth."],"objectives":["Speak with Alphinaud.","Speak with Ilberd at Camp Bluefog, in northern Thanalan.","Speak with Ilberd at the Ceruleum Processing Plant.","Speak with Alphinaud."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MINFILIA","text":"I mean to scour the annals for knowledge of Midgardsormr.
