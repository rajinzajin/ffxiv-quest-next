That same weary hopelessness. It's like I'm back in Ala Gannha..."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Let us not yet lose hope. Though the situation in Namai is bleak, mayhap it is not so elsewhere."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"I wish to speak with others outside the village. Lyse and I will look for farmers in the paddies to the east. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I ask that you look to the south."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Surely they cannot all have given in to despair..."},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"Help me, please!"},{"name":"POP","text":"You sense a hostile presence!"},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"Thank you, thank you, thank you! If you hadn't come along, I don't know what I would've done!"},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"What am I doing out here? Oh...looking for flowers. I need some for my parents' graves."},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"The ones my brother and I usually bring are yellow, because it was my mother's favorite color. You haven't seen any, have you?"},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"If you find any yellow flowers, could you bring them to me? But be careful─my brother says that you have to look out for the vilekin!"},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"Only yellow ones will do.

That's twice you've saved me now!"},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"Um, if you have some time to spare, maybe you could come with me? I'm sure Mother and Father would want to meet the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> who showed me such kindness."},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"We buried them on a cliff to the west of the village. There's a path through the terraces. I'll show you!"},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"We're here! Just give me a moment to put down the flowers, and I'll introduce you..."},{"name":"AZAMI","text":"They loved to meet travelers and hear tales of faraway places. Maybe you could tell them one about your homeland?"},{"name":"ISSE","text":"(-???-)Azami! Azami! Are you there? Azami!"},{"name":"ISSE","text":"What in the─ You should not be here!

My sister is the only family I have. If you saved her, then...thank you. But it changes nothing. I asked you to leave, and now I'm asking you again."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"I'm not going to report you to the imperials, or anything stupid like that. But it's too dangerous for you to stay here.

If they find you here, we're the ones they'll punish! And it'll be a thousand times worse than before!"},{"name":"ISSE","text":"...So she told, did she? Yes. That's right."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"...My mother and father believed in the rebellion. They left to fight for Lord Kaien. They came home on a cart driven by imperial soldiers."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"The soldiers demanded that the families of the insurgents present themselves, or else they'd burn the whole village to the ground."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"So we did. What choice did we have?"},{"name":"ISSE","text":"They beat us in the village square─with their hands, with sticks, with anything. They kicked us while we lay on the ground, begging for mercy. They made us denounce my mother and father─call them fools, call them traitors. Say they deserved to die."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"I heard them laugh, but I dared not look up. One leaned close and whispered in my ear what he'd do to my sister if they had to come back."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"They're gone, but they're never far. All it takes is the wrong word in the wrong ear, and they'll return. And then I'll have to dig another grave. If I'm lucky."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"Whatever you came here to do, leave us out of it. If you want to fight the imperials, go and fight them on your own."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"You can't help us. No one can. And this is all we've got. So please─don't take it from us."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"What's wrong, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?

What of yours?"},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"I...I was not aware of these events... The boy, Isse, he told you all of this?"},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Such disgraceful, despicable crimes... If I knew the men responsible, I would not hesitate to hunt them down and─"},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Forgive me, that outburst was unbecoming. The more I learn of the imperials' actions in my absence, the more difficult I find it to marshal my emotions..."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Could Lord Hien have foreseen this? That our people's spirits would be broken so?
