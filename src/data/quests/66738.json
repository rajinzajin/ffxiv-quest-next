Adventurer─you and I will join the engineers at the Crystal Tower's main gateway, where we will endeavor to neutralize the structure's outer defenses."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Rammbroes, meanwhile, will remain here and oversee the operation. Given my knowledge of Allagan history, it seems logical that I should lead the expedition itself...though I admit the role does not exactly befit my status as an observer."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Still, we can but make use of the resources at hand. Assuming all are in agreement, let us proceed forthwith to the large, lopsided gate found to the southeast."},{"name":"CID","text":"The Crystal Tower lies beyond this portal. Now comes the interesting part..."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Cid, you are the only one of our number who has ever crossed this threshold. I ask that you take the lead for the present."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I say... The energy radiating from these statues is...palpable."},{"name":"CID","text":"Lucky for us that it is. One might otherwise stroll past them... Feast your eyes on the elemental defenses which prompted our lengthy preparations. These sentinels prevent would-be intruders from advancing to within twenty yalms of the tower's inner reaches."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"...No matter how swift they may be."},{"name":"CID","text":"Happily, the crystal fangs we took such pains to craft should spare us the inconvenience of instantaneous annihilation. Here, allow me to demonstrate."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"Ch-Chief!? It's too─"},{"name":"CID","text":"Dangerous to allow anyone else to risk his life testing one? Quite right. I made the damn things─it's my job to see that they work."},{"name":"CID","text":"...Success!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I for one am convinced!

Without us? I thought we came here to survey the entire structure!"},{"name":"CID","text":"We did─and we will. But our investigations must proceed at a more measured pace."},{"name":"CID","text":"If the outside of the place is this well defended, can you imagine what awaits us on the <span class=\"emphasis\">inside</span>?

Do you ever tire of being right, old man!?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Ahem. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─as it seems I won't be accompanying you, allow me at least to provide some instruction. The maze that surrounds the base of the tower is known as the “Labyrinth of the Ancients.” During this initial foray, I suggest you concentrate on ridding the place of hostile elements."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"When you are reasonably certain the maze is secure, contact me via linkshell and we shall join you posthaste─no matter what Master Garlond says!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Though we would prefer it if any relics you encounter remained intact, you have leave to do whatever is necessary to secure ingress to the upper levels of the tower.

Your name shall be writ large in the volumes that are sure to be penned on this historic expedition."},{"name":"CID","text":"The scale of this structure defies comprehension... Someone plainly thought bigger was better."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"According to the findings of my Baldesion colleagues, the Crystal Tower was constructed to collect and store the endless energies of the sun. A characteristically ambitious undertaking."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Now, what of the tower's inner defenses? Judging by your haggard expression, clearing out the labyrinth was no small feat."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"...A giant of a man wielding a shimmering scimitar, you say?

His choice of weapon?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Well, I <span class=\"emphasis\">am</span> a historian. And I have a certain, shall we say, “affinity” for the lore of the Allagan Empire."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"It is, of course, all knowledge gleaned from musty scrolls and tomes. The ancient texts claim that the Crystal Tower is defended by the champions of eld, resurrected and augmented through the Allagans' extraordinary technology."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"Chief, you need to see this!"},{"name":"CID","text":"Well, well, there it is...the foot of the tower. What surprises do <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> have in store for us, I wonder...?"},{"name":"CID","text":"I can't tell you how glad I am to have you with us on this little jaunt, old friend.
