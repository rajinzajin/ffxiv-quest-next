To that end, we tried giving the mother plant the impulse to spray its fruit with its digestive secretion."},{"name":"ZEUXIS","text":"The fruit you brought, we will examine to determine its resistance to the acid, and make adjustments as necessary. My thanks for your help!"},{"name":"ZEUXIS","text":"...Hm? You're looking a bit unwell. You must've gotten the secretion on you, you poor thing. We'd best treat you at once."},{"name":"ZEUXIS","text":"There, you'll be fine now. You did well to endure the pain, but you should've used the balm.
