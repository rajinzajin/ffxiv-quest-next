Hmm... Actually, there's something you might be able to help me with."},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"A visitor from the Bureau of the Architect has arrived at Propylaion to deliver new concepts. I would like you to offer her the warmest of welcomes!"},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"Normally, we'd have our own familiars attend to such duties, but most of them are already entertaining other guests. There's been rather a lot lately, you see."},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"On the other hand, this would be the perfect opportunity to show her an entirely new and─What's a nice way to put this?─<span class=\"emphasis\">idiosyncratic</span> familiar. That being you, of course. I'm sure she'd be delighted to meet you!"},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"Oh, you'd like some sort of description would you? Well, I believe she has a white mask and long, black robes. Does that narrow it down?"},{"name":"BUREAUSTAFF04284","text":"What a pleasant surprise!

As a matter of fact, I too have an errand to ask of you, namely the delivery of these concepts."},{"name":"BUREAUSTAFF04284","text":"I have brought them all the way from the Akadaemia Anyder. Three aquatic fauna specimens from the Words of Mitron and one flora sample from the Words of Halmarut. All <span class=\"emphasis\">very</span> fascinating, as my counterparts here will soon discover."},{"name":"BUREAUSTAFF04284","text":"It would also be prudent to remind Eurydome not to let their captivating nature distract her from making her observations. Well then, there's no time like the present!"},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"I trust our guest was as enamored with you as I am?"},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"New concepts for us? And fascinating to the point of being distracting? What an odd thing to warn me about, though it does all sound rather intriguing."},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"The Akadaemia Anyder always produces concepts of the most outstanding quality, and I'm eager to learn what treats we have in store on this occasion. Let me see..."},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"Hmm... From the Word of Mitron we have what seems to be an aquatic mollusk capable of storing aether in its shell. I can only guess as to what purpose that would serve, but I daresay all will become abundantly clear in due course."},{"name":"EURYDOME","text":"Oh, I do apologize! I already find myself mesmerized by these concepts, just as our visitor predicted. For your part in bringing me these wonders, you have my thanks."}],"reward":{"gil":655},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69961]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1037955","obj":{"i":1037955,"n":"Eurydome","l":3713,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69961","obj":{"i":69961,"n":"Their Greatest Contribution","g":11,"l":"Elpis","s":579}}]}
