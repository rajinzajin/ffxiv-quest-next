For the first step, the weaponsmith bids you venture within Zahar'ak in southern Thanalan to retrieve the lost pair of Sphairai. Search for a vessel in which the valuable relic might be kept.","You have obtained the pair of timeworn Sphairai. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and present the relic to Gerolt.","According to Gerolt, the restoration process involves merging the old with the new─that is, embedding the original relic in a new host weapon. To this end, you must bring him a pair of wildling's cesti melded with two grade three savage aim materia.","You have delivered the materia-enhanced wildling's cesti to Gerolt. The weaponsmith next directs you to go to the Weeping Saint in the Coerthas central highlands, and obtain alumina salts from the dhorme chimera.<br><br>※The dhorme chimera can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.","You have painstakingly obtained the pinch of alumina salts. Make your way back to Hyrstmill and deliver it to Gerolt.","Using the alumina salts you brought him, Gerolt adds the finishing touches to your relic weapon. Even as he declares his work over, however, the man believes that there is still something incomplete about it. In order to shed light upon the mystery, Gerolt suggests that you seek out literature surrounding the hero associated with the relic. Perhaps the trader Rowena back at Revenant's Toll will be able to assist you in this endeavor.","You have consulted Rowena, who agrees to procure the literature you seek...for a price. For your part of the deal, you must obtain for her an Amdapor glyph. Make your way through Amdapor Keep in the South Shroud, and procure this artifact.<br><br>※Amdapor Keep can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.","You have successfully obtained an Amdapor glyph. Make your way back to Revenant's Toll and deliver it to Rowena.","You give the Amdapor glyph to Rowena, who upholds her promise and furnishes you a copy of <span class=\"emphasis\">Enter the Coeurl</span>. You now possess literature on the hero who once wielded the relic weapon. Gerolt the weaponsmith will be keen to peruse it.","After a cursory examination of the text, Gerolt declares that he will require some time to make sense of its contents. In the meantime, you are to familiarize yourself with the restored weapon in its current state. Arm yourself with the pair of unfinished Sphairai, make your way to Zahar'ak in southern Thanalan, and there slay eight Zahar'ak lancers, eight Zahar'ak pugilists, and eight Zahar'ak archers.","You have defeated the specified Amalj'aa. Return to Hyrstmill and report your success to Gerolt.","Upon your return, Gerolt deduces that you must face mightier adversaries if you are to experience a revelation pertaining to your relic. To this end, he bids you challenge the hydra within Halatali, the abandoned training grounds situated in eastern Thanalan. Armed with the pair of unfinished Sphairai, enter Halatali and defeat the hydra.<br><br>※The hydra can be confronted via the Duty Finder upon examining the quest destination.","You have overcome the hydra. Take word of your accomplishment back to Gerolt at Hyrstmill.","Combining information gleaned from the text with your firsthand experience, Gerolt has ascertained what must be done next. Hand over the pair of unfinished Sphairai to the weaponsmith.","Gerolt declares that but one step remains in the restoration. In order to create the raging fire that he needs, the weaponsmith bids you fetch him a white-hot ember, a howling gale, and a chunk of hyperfused ore. The first of these can be obtained by defeating Ifrit within the Bowl of Embers (Hard).<br><br>※The Bowl of Embers (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.","You have extinguished the Lord of the Inferno and obtained a white-hot ember. Next, take on Garuda in the Howling Eye (Hard) and defeat her to obtain a howling gale.<br><br>※The Howling Eye (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.","You have silenced the Lady of the Vortex and obtained a howling gale. Next, take on Titan in the Navel (Hard) and defeat him to obtain a chunk of hyperfused ore.<br><br>※The Navel (Hard) can be accessed via the Duty Finder.<br>※This objective must be completed as a monk.","You have buried the Lord of Crags and obtained a chunk of hyperfused ore. Deliver it along with the white-hot ember and the howling gale to Gerolt.","You have delivered the three items Gerolt requires to create a raging fire. Now he only wants for a bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to complete the restoration of your relic. Obtain this item and deliver it to the weaponsmith.","You have delivered the bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to Gerolt, who promptly sees to the final stage of the restoration process. After no small amount of effort and perseverance, you are now the proud owner of the pair of Sphairai. May it serve you well in your adventures to come!"],"objectives":["Obtain the pair of timeworn Sphairai from a treasure coffer in Zahar'ak.","Deliver the pair of timeworn Sphairai to Gerolt.","Deliver a pair of materia-enhanced wildling's cesti to Gerolt.","Examine the destination at the Weeping Saint and, as a monk, use the Duty Finder to complete the trial “A Relic Reborn: The Chimera.”","Deliver the alumina salts to Gerolt.","Speak with Rowena at Revenant's Toll.","Obtain an Amdapor glyph by completing Amdapor Keep as a monk.","Deliver the Amdapor glyph to Rowena.","Deliver the copy of <span class=\"emphasis\">Enter the Coeurl</span> to Gerolt.","Slay Zahar'ak lancers while equipped with the pair of unfinished Sphairai.","Slay Zahar'ak pugilists while equipped with the pair of unfinished Sphairai.","Slay Zahar'ak archers while equipped with the pair of unfinished Sphairai.","Speak with Gerolt.","Examine the destination outside Halatali and, with the pair of unfinished Sphairai equipped, use the Duty Finder to complete the trial “A Relic Reborn: The Hydra.”","Speak with Gerolt.","Give the pair of unfinished Sphairai to Gerolt.","Obtain a white-hot ember in the Bowl of Embers (Hard) as a monk.","Obtain a howling gale in the Howling Eye (Hard) as a monk.","Obtain a chunk of hyperfused ore in the Navel (Hard) as a monk.","Deliver the requested items to Gerolt.","Deliver a bottle of Radz–at–Han quenching oil to Gerolt."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GEROLT","text":"Jus' let me make one thing clear: it might be as I'm repairin' kettles to pay for yesterday's mead, but I still got me pride as a master weaponsmith.
