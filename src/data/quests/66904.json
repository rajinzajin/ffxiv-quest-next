Bo Bu, ever eager to please, exhorts you to consult with Ba Go to come up with a means for destroying this hatchery of havoc.","Ba Go, welcoming the explosive demise of any bombs other than the beauties fashioned by his own hand, informs you that the bomb incubator is quite easily destroyed and sends you on your way. He does so not without assigning you a task, however: the recovery of a dazzling bomb's glowing arm that he would use to further his research. As said research demands the acolyte's full attention, you are to deliver your findings to Bo Bu.","The incubator falls quickly to your hand, spitting sparks and flames every which way. Search the embers and slay any hostile bombs that have survived the destruction.","The bombs too have fallen, reducing your immediate surroundings to a blazing inferno that would rival the seventh hell, yet your task is not yet done. Search the embers for the most dazzling bomb of all, slaying it and lopping off its still-glowing arm for the good of science.","The dazzling bomb's arm is yours, and what an arm it is! Return to the 789th Order Dig with a skip in your step, and entrust it to Dustman Bo Bu, reminding him that Ba Go will come seeking it at a later juncture.","Bo Bu rejoices at the bomb incubator's destruction, while relishing the opportunity to deliver a gift in person to the esteemed Ba Go. The acolyte is a stern taskmaster, but mayhap the young dustman's zeal will earn his respect yet. In the meantime, you can take pride in knowing that your efforts have earned the dig a brief respite from Zo Ga's fiery wrath..."],"objectives":["Speak with 789th Order Acolyte Ba Go.","Destroy a prototype bomb incubator in U'Ghamaro Mines.","Search the embers for the dazzling bomb and slay it to acquire its arm.","Deliver the glowing arm to 789th Order Dustman Bo Bu."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BOBU","text":"Great, great balls of fire, gas, and smoke!
