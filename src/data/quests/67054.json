The Ehcatl Nine knotcounter has personally spoken with Templeton and does not believe you will need to bribe the Highwind Skyways representative to gain access to the crafting facilities at the Observatorium. The knotcounter also does not believe a thing Templeton says, so he warns you to be ready to perform some random task for the unappreciative sot.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Too bothered to walk up a few flights of stairs, Templeton agrees to allow you access to the crafting facilities only if you will deliver a Highwind Skyways timetable to Jocea atop the astroscope tower and return with a signature proving she received the document.","You have upheld your end of the bargain and delivered the timetable to Jocea. Now return to Templeton with her signature─proof proper of your deed.","Templeton is every bit as dishonest as advertised, and now you have full access to the Highwind Skyways temporary crafting facilities.
