Have you got a minute?"},{"name":"MAN02682","text":"I think I saw a girl collapsed on the beach, but I need to be sure. When you are up here for hours at a time, your eyes begin playing tricks on you. Here─take this telescope. Point it in that direction and tell me if you see her, too."},{"name":"MAN02682","text":"Take a look at the coast over there with the telescope. Do you see an unconscious girl?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Search your surroundings for the unconscious girl. You may move the camera as well as zoom in and out.

Bah! Even just thinking about it gives me the shivers!"},{"name":"MAN02682","text":"Please, can you go and see if she is all right? I shall remain here, lest you end up having to take care of two unconscious people on the beach."},{"name":"AOGAMI","text":"Th-Thank you, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. You saved my life. I was gathering food from the sea when suddenly I was attacked by shore jellyfish. Their stings left me paralyzed, and I was washed ashore by the currents."},{"name":"AOGAMI","text":"Where I am from we are taught growing up to avoid contact with strangers. We would never go out of our way to rescue them. If it were not for your remarkable compassion, I would have no doubt died upon these shores, far away from home."},{"name":"AOGAMI","text":"As much as I would like to offer you a reward for what you have done for me, I sadly have nothing of value on me. If our paths should ever cross again, however, I shall be sure to give you something."},{"name":"MAN02682","text":"You are back. W-Was she...alive?"},{"name":"MAN02682","text":"I was watching the two of you from afar with my telescope. Kami be praised! It seems the girl was still alive. Did she tell you what happened to her?"},{"name":"MAN02682","text":"Indeed? The waters carry a myriad of strange things our way, including people. Though, most of them are already d-dead by the time they reach us. That is why I am up here and not down there doing patrols."},{"name":"MAN02682","text":"Had you not come when you did, I may have been forced to go down and deal with her myself. By the time I worked up the courage to do so, she might have been long gone. Please take this pouch of koban. You have saved not one, but two people today."}],"reward":{"gil":829,"items":[{"id":18257,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18258,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18259,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5678,"one":1}],"xp":91800},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":62,"id":34}],"quests":[68017]},"next":[68237]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1023307","obj":{"i":1023307,"n":"Perplexed Confederate","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1023308","obj":{"i":1023308,"n":"Sapphire-haired Girl","l":2409,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"18257","obj":{"i":18257,"n":"Koppranickel Bracelet of Fending","l":265,"c":55771,"t":42,"p":15741}},{"type":"item","id":"18258","obj":{"i":18258,"n":"Koppranickel Bracelet of Slaying","l":265,"c":55771,"t":42,"p":15741}},{"type":"item","id":"18259","obj":{"i":18259,"n":"Koppranickel Bracelet of Aiming","l":265,"c":55771,"t":42,"p":15741}},{"type":"item","id":"5678","obj":{"i":5678,"n":"Savage Might Materia V","l":160,"c":20258,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Determination","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68017","obj":{"i":68017,"n":"Alisaie's Stones","g":6,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":360}},{"type":"quest","id":"68237","obj":{"i":68237,"n":"Fear Her Almighty Waves","g":108,"l":"The Ruby Sea","s":3050}}]}
