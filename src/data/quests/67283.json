He provides you with a report outlining the patients' symptoms and asks you to deliver it to Noirterel. He hopes that he might be able to help develop a cure.","Though Noirterel does not know how to develop an antidote, he is reminded of a book, predating the Calamity, that described a poison-breathing dragon. He does not know any more himself, but suspects this dragon may be the source of the poison afflicting the troops. Someone more knowledgeable about the Sixth Astral Era might be more helpful. Find Sigan and show him Redwald's report.","Sigan relates an old Coerthan tale describing the source of the dragons' poisonous breath─a deadly and poisonous type of brambleweed known as thorny viper. A creature that nests near Gorgagne Mills, the blackblood zu, eats this same toxic plant. Whatever grants the zu immunity to the thorny viper may hold the key to creating an antidote to the dragon poison ultimately stemming from the same root. Sigan provides you with an ember and some fragrant herbs. Travel to Gorgagne Mills, use the herbs to lure the zu from its nest, and retrieve its blood.","You find a conveniently located brazier and light it with the ember. Use this hearty fire to burn the aromatic herbs and draw the zu from hiding.","The burning herbs will soon attract the zu. Lie in wait for the beast. When it appears, kill it and take its precious blood.","You have slain the zu. Return to Sigan with its blood.","No sooner do you deliver the blood to Sigan than Redwald appears. He apologizes wholeheartedly for disregarding the hard-earned wisdom of Coerthas' native citizens. He sends for Ishgard's finest alchemists to refine the zu blood into an antidote and pledges to repay Sigan's assistance with the hospitality he deserves."],"objectives":["Deliver the report to Noirterel.","Deliver the report to Sigan.","Use the ember on the brazier.","Use the fragrant herbs on the burning brazier.","Lie in wait for the blackblood zu; slay it and obtain its blood.","Deliver the zu blood to Sigan."],"dialogue":[{"name":"REDWALD","text":"There is a breed of dragon that breathes deadly poisonous breath. If you were to make poison by concentrating the toxic component of their breath, it would be almost impossible to formulate an antidote."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"We have precious little information, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. Thus I had hoped you might assist us once more."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"This report describes the symptoms of the poisoned soldiers. Please show it to anyone you think might be able to assist in the formulation of an antidote. I suggest starting with our chef, Noirterel."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"Show that report to anyone you think could help formulate an antidote to the poison affecting our soldiers. Try starting with Noirterel─Falcon's Nest's chef."},{"name":"NOIRTEREL","text":"Oh, you're that <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">lad</span></span> from before. Have you caught the people who poisoned that wine yet?"},{"name":"NOIRTEREL","text":"I see. So the poison was most likely made from concentrated dragon venom? I don't know a great deal about venomous dragons, but I do remember reading something about poison-breathing dragons in a book of old from before the Calamity."},{"name":"NOIRTEREL","text":"Sadly, I can't remember the specifics. Given how old the book was, perhaps you might be able to find out more from someone knowledgeable about the Sixth Astral Era."},{"name":"NOIRTEREL","text":"I suggest you try showing that document to someone who knows more about the Sixth Astral Era. They might be able to tell you something useful."},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"Hm? What do you want?"},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"Poison made from concentrated dragon venom? Ah, yes. There was a story passed down through the generations in the old village of Falcon's Nest about dragons that breathe poison."},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"“Be ye ware the beast with poison breath,<br>whose claws and breath bring naught but certain death.<br>The ancient dragon's noxious mist is born<br>from eating of the poisoned viper's thorn.”"},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"Thorny viper is a type of toxic brambleweed; this toxin is said to be the source of the dragons' poisonous breath. If we find a creature immune to the thorny viper, we should be able to study this immunity to develop an antidote to the dragons' poison."},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"There's a beast that lives near Gorgagne Mills: the blackblood zu. They say it feeds primarily on the thorny viper. Its blood may hold the key to saving the afflicted soldiers. Take these provisions, and travel to Gorgagne Mills."},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"This is a herb that, when burned, should attract the zu. When you reach the mill, use this ember and burn the herbs. The scent should draw the beast out of hiding. Slay it and recover its blood."},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"Go to Gorgagne Mills and burn the herbs. The scent should draw the zu out of hiding.

An antidote may well be possible after all."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>, I spied you down here and hurried down, hoping you could inform me of the status of your investigations.

Take it to your brightest alchemists and have them formulate the cure. If you move quickly, you can still save those poisoned soldiers."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"Good grief. To think that those old legends could bear the solution to a problem like this. I shall call for the Holy See's best alchemists immediately."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"Master Sigan... We have been so focused on moving forward that we have lost sight of where we have come from. To be frank, I thought you were but a fool who could not let go of the past."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"...But in light of these events, I have been forced to reconsider. The culture and traditions of Falcon's Nest hold great value. They are truly priceless."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"If it pleases, perhaps you might be so kind as to lend us your assistance in an excavation of the village? I can only offer my most sincere apologies for how little we have done to make you feel welcome until now."},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"As you yourself said, Redwald, I can't let go of the past. But I understand that everything you've done, you've done to protect the people of Ishgard. I can't help but feel that there are issues more deserving of your resources than an archaeological dig."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"Very well. How might this suit you, then:"},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"If you ever happen to pass by the fortress of Falcon's Nest─whenever you might happen to stop by our halls─we shall be sure to have a hot bowl of soup waiting for you."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"In exchange, I ask only that you pass on the legends and stories of the old village of Falcon's Nest, such that we may learn from your knowledge and wisdom. Does that strike you as a better arrangement?"},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"Hmph. A nice suggestion, I suppose. But I can't stand the taste of your Ishgardian cooking. Your cooks are far too heavy-handed with the salt and spice."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"If that is your only objection, then you need not worry. Our head chef is a Coerthan man. We troops are always complaining about his Coerthan-style cooking─that his soup is too thin and bland. I suspect it may suit you perfectly."},{"name":"SIGAN","text":"Hm. A Coerthan chef, you say? I may enjoy the food after all."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"It may be true that Falcon's Nest is no longer a small village, but we are still home to the same people. We still have a responsibility to carry this culture and history on into the future."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"Though the village itself may be lost to time and snow, we have the opportunity to find a new path to lead these people to peace and prosperity. Carving that path is my charge."},{"name":"REDWALD","text":"Come, let me introduce you to our chef. We can enjoy a bowl of thin Coerthan soup together."}],"reward":{"gil":858,"xp":24000},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":50,"id":34}],"questsType":"all","quests":[67134,67282]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1011231","obj":{"i":1011231,"n":"Redwald","l":2200,"q":17}},{"type":"npc","id":"1014123","obj":{"i":1014123,"n":"Sigan","l":2200,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1011238","obj":{"i":1011238,"n":"Noirterel","l":2200,"q":5}},{"type":"quest","id":"67134","obj":{"i":67134,"n":"Disclosure","g":3,"l":"Ishgard","s":19}},{"type":"quest","id":"67282","obj":{"i":67282,"n":"Bad Wine","g":94,"l":"Coerthas Western Highlands","s":5009}}]}
