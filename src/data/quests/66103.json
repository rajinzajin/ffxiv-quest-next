Meet your guildmaster at Forgotten Springs in southern Thanalan to receive further instructions.","By way of a warm-up for your bout, Hamon bids you defeat five of the sandworms that inhabit the area south of Forgotten Springs.","You have defeated five sandworms. Report back to Hamon.","No sooner does your training end than Chuchuto arrives bearing news that Weggfarr has returned to Ul'dah, and is demanding that Hamon come for the rematch. Make your way to Emerald Avenue, where the odious marauder awaits.","To his great shock, Weggfarr finds himself downed by Hamon before he can even swing his axe. Unwilling to admit defeat, he resorts to using a substance he calls pluto to enhance his strength, and comes at you in a frenzy. With Rurukuta fighting beside you this time, you succeed in overcoming the marauder and his minions. Make your way to the Pugilists' Guild, where Hamon awaits.","In no small part due to your help, Hamon has defeated his long-standing rival, and the future of the guild is secure.

You did well to deploy them where you did, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">son</span></span>. Thanks to you, I almost got killed several times!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"But what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, and I'm feeling stronger than I have in ages. As a matter of fact, I reckon I'm not far from regaining my former strength. One last step will get me there, and I'll take it by having another bout with you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"I want you to meet me out in the Sagolii Desert, at a settlement called Forgotten Springs. The place is home to the most luscious Miqo'te maidens this side of Eorzea!

Gods, I can't wait to behold the luscious maidens there again!"},{"name":"CHUCHUTO","text":"I'm to hold the fort while you and Master Hamon train out in the desert. See you upon your return!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"This landscape takes me back, it does. Sand as far as the eyes can see... Crystal-clear spring waters cooling your feet... Scantily clad lasses giggling as they bathe and frolic..."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; I well remember <span class=\"emphasis\">these</span> things, but my body has forgotten the seamless combinations that earned me the epithet of Holyfist."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"That's where I'd have you enter, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Sparring with you is what first got me back into the swing of things. Now it's time to finish the job. But before we begin, some warming up is in order."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"I want you to take yourself across the dunes to the south and defeat five sandworms. I'll be waiting for you here."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"What? Don't <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> need a warm-up, too? Oh, don't you worry, I had mine long before you arrived. Those enormous buggers never knew what hit them!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Hah hah hah! If you don't want to be outdone by this old man, you'd best run along and give them more of the same!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Have you seen to the sandworms yet? Don't keep me waiting too long─my joints are starting to stiffen up."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Duty calls. Do you wish to proceed with<br>“Return of the Holyfist”?"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Ah, so you've seen to the sandworms? Marvelous! Now the real training can begin!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Thanks to you, I've managed to get most of my stamina back. I'm confident that I can go the distance with the fittest of them."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"But if I'm to defeat Weggfarr, I'll need more than just endurance; I'll need to remember how each strike transitions to the next. And <span class=\"emphasis\">you're</span> going to help refresh my memory...by pummeling the sense back into me!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"&lt;cough&gt; &lt;gasp&gt; I've...I've got it!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"As a river flows to the sea, heedless of all that bars its path, so too must our combinations be!

The man is back in Ul'dah, and he's demanding that you fight him─<span class=\"emphasis\">now</span>!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"So it begins... Very well, I will go to settle the score with Weggfarr. He will be the first to know that the Holyfist has returned!"},{"name":"WEGGFARR","text":"Heh, I didn't expect ye to come so soon, if at all. Ye sure ye want to go ahead with this? I'm a man o' reason, an' I'd sooner not have to hurt ye. Just give up now, an' we can put an end to this mummer's farce. Ye can live out the rest o' yer days in peace."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"The only mummer's farce I see is a man trying to squirm out of his own self-wrought challenge. Well, I'm going to make you the <span class=\"emphasis\">same</span> offer: walk away, and you won't get hurt."},{"name":"MOBA","text":"They say Hamon Holyfist is going to perform his legendary technique!"},{"name":"MOBAB","text":"Right here on the avenue!? Is it safe!?"},{"name":"WEGGFARR","text":"Gahaha! I see age has robbed ye o' yer wits as well as yer strength!"},{"name":"WEGGFARR","text":"Well, if yer so eager for pain, who am I to deny it to ye?

I refuse to be beaten by a senile old fool!"},{"name":"WEGGFARR","text":"Get yer arses out here, all o' ye!"},{"name":"WEGGFARR","text":"'Case yer wonderin', that was <span class=\"emphasis\">pluto</span>!"},{"name":"WEGGFARR","text":"Just a draft of it, an' yer body turns hard as iron! Not even blades can pierce it!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Hmph, stubborn bugger..."},{"name":"CHUCHUTO","text":"Rurukuta!? But...<span class=\"emphasis\">why</span>?"},{"name":"RURUKUTA","text":"I refuse to fight on the side of cheats."},{"name":"WEGGFARR","text":"Gahahahahaha!

You won!"},{"name":"RURUKUTA","text":"Master..."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"No, Chuchuto─<span class=\"emphasis\">we</span> won. This victory wasn't mine alone."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Holy fisticuffs, that was incredible! You wiped the avenue with those crooks!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"I'm going to tell my grandchildren tales of what happened here!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Our work here is done. Let's all go home─to the guild!"},{"name":"RURUKUTA","text":"The guild hasn't changed one bit..."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"I want to thank you again, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. It's because of you I was able to rekindle my fighting spirit and conquer my demons."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Perhaps even more importantly, Rurukuta's come to his senses, and Chuchuto's back to her bubbly self."},{"name":"RURUKUTA","text":"Please forgive me, Master. I will have no more to do with the Alacran. I will roam the land till I find myself, and strive to become a great pugilist like you."},{"name":"CHUCHUTO","text":"You've only just returned, and you're leaving us already? &lt;sigh&gt; I don't suppose there is aught I can say that will change your mind. But if you ever want for company or a sparring partner, know that you're always welcome here."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Hah hah hah! Youthful vigor's a truly blessed thing! Go well, my boy. There's not a doubt in my mind that you'll do me proud."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"As for you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Your combinations were a sight to behold...and right painful to receive. In helping me with my training, you've come into your own as a pugilist."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"The time's ripe that I taught you the technique that won me countless bouts on the bloodsands."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"I call it “Demolish.” Unleashed when in the coeurl form, it combines powerful punches and kicks that'll send your opponent reeling."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"You have grown strong, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, but your journey as a pugilist is far from over. To get as far as I have, you'll have to overcome many and more trials and tribulations."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"But whatever challenges threaten to block your way, I'm confident that you'll be able to blaze yourself a path."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"So long as your spirit burns bright and your fists fly with conviction, there's nothing you can't achieve. I'm the living proof!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Forge onward, young one, and create a legend for yourself never to be forgot!"},{"name":"QIB","text":"Hit me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!
