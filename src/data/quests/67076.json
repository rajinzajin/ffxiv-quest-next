{"quest":{"name":"A Rousing Douse","location":"Lower La Noscea","id":67076,"patch":2.3,"sort":48,"repeatable":1,"icon":100281,"eventIcon":71222,"issuer":1009248,"target":1009248,"genre":201,"journal":["Say the word to Ethelia, and the Moonfire Faire event Rousing Douse is yours to try, try again.<br>※This quest is available for a limited time only.","Ever the quizzer, Ethelia is nevertheless deadly earnest about the import of this fire–fighting exhibition. If you would mount an elbst, find a Moonfire marine east of the Blind Iron Mines.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","Someone once said that one can see more clearly while astride an elbst. Whether or not that's so, it would be hard to miss the fires burning merrily in three designated spots in Cedarwood. Go forth, elbst rider, and Saturate the flames with water, cold and clear.","Thrice you have spurred the elbst to spew forth its watery ballast, and thrice have you seen a pillar of fire crumble to sodden cinders. The chaperone Ethelia would no doubt like to hear of this, as well as disconcert you again with her quizzing ways.","All's well that ends wet, according to Ethelia─at least when it comes to an event billed as a Rousing Douse. Your time on an elbst was all too brief, but fortunately, a return engagement with the Moonfire Marines is on offer, should you decide to accept."],"objectives":["Speak with the Moonfire marine, then mount up on an elbst.","Saturate targets while riding an elbst.","Report to Ethelia."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"All right, let's mount up and upchuck! No hesitation now─Saturate the pillars of fire set up on the spots I've marked."},{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"When you're ready to begin, just go straight east and talk to the Moonfire marine there."},{"name":"EXABU01540","text":"Want to ride an elbst? I don't keep one in my pocket, you know. Go straight east and find a Moonfire marine to help you."},{"name":"EXABU01540","text":"Mount up, elbst rider! And don't report back to Ethelia until you've Saturated all three targets. Come to me instead if you fall off the elbst."},{"name":"EXABU01540","text":"Come to me if you fall off the elbst. I'll heave you back on quick as a cough!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Use the Saturate action on pillars of fire set up on target spots. The action can be selected from the <span class=\"highlight\">pet hotbar</span>."},{"name":"MIQOTEA01540","text":"(-Sweet Spectator-)Hurrah! You did it; you put out the fire! That was amazing!"},{"name":"MIQOTEB01540","text":"(-Sultry Spectator-)Oooh, you got me...I'm <span class=\"emphasis\">soaked</span> through.<br>...Oh, were you aiming for the fire? My mistake."},{"name":"MIQOTEC01540","text":"(-Serious Spectator-)Very effective indeed. Yes. And quite refreshing, I might add."},{"name":"MIQOTED01540","text":"(-Spirited Spectator-)Haha! Phew! Isn't that something? I could do with a douse every day!"},{"name":"MIQOTEE01540","text":"(-Sedate Spectator-)Wait, wha...!? You mean “douse” like we get drenched? I thought, you know, like <span class=\"emphasis\">looking</span> for water!"},{"name":"ROEGADYNA01540","text":"(-Spirited Spectator-)Hey! Hey! What do you think you're <span class=\"emphasis\">doing</span>? That's just going too far, I tell you─far too far!"},{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"There you are! You did know I was just kidding about drenching the audience? Just kidding! Heard you did great out there."},{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"Made a good impression on the audience, didn't we, especially the kiddies? You cut quite a figure, I'm told. Once you go elbst-back, you never go back, am I right?"},{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"Some of those little ones now say they want to be adventurers, and it's all thanks to you. Oh, you don't think so? Humility's a virtue, my mammy always said─turns out she was just kidding! Best to accept a compliment graciously, my friend."},{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"Speaking of giving credit, Haermaga's the one who started in on the “do it for the children” bit. He goes about pretending it was someone else's idea, but he's not fooling me. Families have turned out for the faire in droves thanks to him."},{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"Oh, he's awfully secretive about things he's actually good at. But he's a shrewd one, a practical man under all that buffoonery. He's right that we need to put ourselves out there─think about the future of the guild, instead of just living for today."},{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"Anyway, I'd better give you your reward─you've certainly earned it! You're welcome back among the Moonfire Marines any time. The audience would love a return performance, I'm sure."},{"name":"ETHELIA","text":"Another day, another douse!
