The beast was strangely docile, however, and against his better judgment, he chose to capture rather than slay it. Hearing of your recent foray into the void, he hopes your expertise can prove useful in discerning what the voidsent may be plotting. To that end, he asks you to accompany him to the Hall of the Radiant Host.","Having died shortly after your arrival at the court of Troia, the sullen-eyed voidsent fled to the Source seeking sanctuary from the void's vicious cycle of undeath. However, it was not fully recovered before making the journey, causing it to split into several lesser voidsent. It asks that you search Radz-at-Han for its missing kin. In exchange, they will share with you knowledge of the void.","You travel about the city and find four wayward hecteyes, each of which recounts a grim tale of the Thirteenth and the denizens of the void. The voidsent will no doubt be glad to be reunited, and the Radiant scout relieved to know the streets are safe.","The sullen-eyed voidsent thanks you for gathering its kindred voidsent, and makes ready to reunite with them...but something is amiss. It would seem there are yet more pieces of itself that have yet to be found. Should the hecteyes sense more wayward voidsent, it hopes you will answer its call for help once more."],"objectives":["Speak with the Radiant scout.","Search for the wayward hecteyes.","Speak with the sullen-eyed voidsent."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SCOUT04660","text":"Ah, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you couldn't have appeared at a better time!"},{"name":"SCOUT04660","text":"You see, while out patrolling the city, I chanced to sight a voidsent."},{"name":"SCOUT04660","text":"I immediately chased it down with the intent of eliminating it, but something about it struck me as odd.

Please, you must help me!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"What do you need help with?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You were at the castle?"},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"Oho, you <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> understand me!"},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"Indeed I was, but I've since fled here."},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"I understand the mortal tongue well enough, but I don't have a mouth to produce the sounds.

Could you ask it why it came here?"},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"When you and yours stormed the castle, I was caught up in the fighting and died."},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"In time I returned, but I tire of fighting. So I fled, using the gate to your world."},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"Having just been reborn, however, my essence hadn't fully bound together yet. And so, when I emerged from the gate, it was as several sundered selves. "},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"Frightened and confused, they scattered. Following their trail led me here, my diminutive size allowing me to remain largely unseen."},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"But by the same token, I can do little more than sneak about. Each of us was weak and powerless. That's why we consumed one another in the first place. Together we were strong.

Do we have a bargain?"},{"name":"SCOUT04660","text":"So it crossed over to our world to escape conflict, and now searches for...the rest of itself?"},{"name":"SCOUT04660","text":"I understand voidsent are quite reliable when it comes to fulfilling a pact.

If you would be so kind as to search for its kin, I will consult my superiors on how best to deal with them."},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"By that, I take it we have a bargain. Good, good."},{"name":"HECTEYES","text":"I sense four others close by. When you find them, you need only point them in this direction.

I hear you fought well against the voidsent that slipped through."},{"name":"WARRIOR04660B","text":"Come now, I merely did my duty.

Where was it that I heard them...?"},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"Ah, yes. It was the early days of the Contramemoria. The enemy had conjured a terrible eidolon that laid siege to a fortress."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"The garrison was made up of ordinary soldiers. Men and women with no remarkable abilities. But led by their valiant commander, they fought bravely and desperately."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"They had to last until the memoriate arrived, the commander told them.

What's the meaning of this!?"},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"The eidolon was savage, but mindless. It was a simple thing to hide myself beneath fallen debris."},{"name":"MEMORIAMASTER04660","text":"Hide!? As commander, you had a duty to your men! You were supposed to put their lives before your own!"},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"Spare me! My duty was to ensure the fortress stood─and it did!"},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"Besides, my death would've achieved nothing, honor be damned! No, I'm sworn to protect our nation, and to do that I must live! It isn't my fate to fall here!"},{"name":"MEMORIAMASTER04660","text":"It isn't your fate, you say?"},{"name":"STEWARD04660","text":"Is... Is he...?"},{"name":"MEMORIAMASTER04660","text":"Merely unconscious. Come, let us bury the soldiers...and their commander with them."},{"name":"MEMORIAMASTER04660","text":"Fate shall decide what becomes of him. Whether he lives or dies."},{"name":"STEWARD04660","text":"Very well, my lord."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Funeral rites were later held for the fallen. But solemn tears quickly gave way to horrified screams as a body emerged from the earth─the commander."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)“I can't die. I must live,” the man is said to have declared."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)The people thought him a demon. A disheveled horror, muttering curses as he wandered off to regions unknown."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Scarmiglione, they called him. A name befitting his newfound grisly visage. A name befitting a monster."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"We thought we buried him deep. But a mortal's desire to live is not to be underestimated."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"You're a mortal, so I expect you understand that desire."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660A","text":"Well, that concludes my tale. I had best rejoin my selves. If you'll excuse me..."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"So this is where mortals consume aether."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"Dreading loneliness more than hunger... How very like me. If you don't mind, though, I'd like to observe the mortals a while longer."},{"name":"ARKASODARA04660A","text":"The food here is simply sublime! Why, I feel stronger with every bite, as if the Mrga Themselves were granting me Their blessing!"},{"name":"ARKASODARA04660B","text":"The food is tasty, that's true enough. But no food is so sublime as to be a substitute for proper training, my friend."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"Stronger with every bite, every feed..."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"For my part of the bargain, I will tell you about how we voidsent become strong. Simply put, it depends on the quality and quantity of aether we harbor."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"When the world was consumed by Darkness, the heroes known as memoriates arose as powerful voidsent."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"In contrast, the vast majority of mortals, powerless and unremarkable as they were, became ordinary voidsent. Like me."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"There were exceptions, of course. But one in particular, I'll never forget."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Scarmiglione... Never had I seen a voidsent so craven. Even when pushed to the brink of starvation, he would prey only on those weaker than himself."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)He subsisted on scant leavings, and lived in constant fear and hunger."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)In the face of danger, of voidsent stronger than himself, fleeing was the only option."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)But a day came when he found his way barred."},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)How pitiful..."},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"S-Such overwhelming aether... Who is this!?"},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)You fled instead of facing your foe. Why?"},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"Why? I'm too weak, why else? I would have been devoured."},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)So had you enough strength, you would have stood your ground? ...Very well, then."},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"Wh-What's happening!?"},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"Yesss. I feel it... The power, ssswelling within me!"},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)Lo, your foe returns."},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"Hissssss... What have you done to me?"},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)I granted you but a sliver of aether. 'Twas with the power you already possessed that you defeated your foe."},{"name":"EARTHMONOLITH","text":"I possessed such power...?"},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)Fear had clouded your eyes. Blinded you to the strength you had attained feeding on the weak."},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)If you would free yourself from fear, then join me. You shall have a greater cause to live for and know true power."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Curious how, in a world without death, the fear of it could be the key to great strength."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)The knight recognized this─recognized the voidsent's potential. And thus did he take him into his service."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"Determined as he is to live, it wouldn't surprise me if he were still somewhere out there."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"He'd be even more powerful now, I expect, from all the devouring he would have done since. Unlike your world, eating actually makes you stronger in ours."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660B","text":"Well, I must be going now. The others are waiting."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"My other self grows lonely, you say?"},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"My apologies. It was my intent to seek out the others, but I was distracted by the bickering pair of mortals yonder. My goodness, but there's been some colorful language!"},{"name":"MAN04660","text":"To hells with your father! You shouldn't need his permission just to leave the godsdamned house!"},{"name":"WOMAN04660","text":"Please, mind your language! What would Father say if he were to hear you?"},{"name":"MAN04660","text":"Ugh, it's always “Father this, Father that” with you! I'm sick of it! You're your own woman now─bloody act like one for a change!"},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"Colorful language, yes? Not from the girl, though. Oh no, she appears to be quite well bred."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"I just hope she's happier than a girl I knew long, long ago..."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)That girl was born into a family of thugs who suddenly found themselves nobility."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)She was raised as a noblewoman, and had servants tending to her every need. But in the end, she was merely a beautiful bird kept in a gilded cage."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Wanting her to be a proper lady, her parents presided over all aspects of her life. They decided everything for her, telling her what to say and do."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Chafing from the fetters of her restrictive life, she solicited her handmaiden's aid and stole outside the manor, where she enjoyed a moment of bliss unbeknownst to her parents. Or so she thought..."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)It was not long before her father dragged her back to her room, barring the door and windows, denying her even the simple pleasure of an afternoon breeze."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Even a bird in a cage may chirp freely, but she wasn't even suffered to give voice to her desires."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)But she wouldn't be deterred. Having once tasted sweet freedom, she yearned for more. And one day, she succeeded in sneaking out of the manor a second time."},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"You're late. I was beginning to think you wouldn't come."},{"name":"DAD04660","text":"If you're expecting your friends, I'm afraid they're not coming."},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"F-Father!? How did you─? What do you mean...they're not coming?"},{"name":"DAD04660","text":"I had known that some miscreants were cavorting in these parts, but to think that they'd dare try to consort with my daughter... Well, you needn't worry about them anymore. They're food for the fishes now."},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"&lt;gasp&gt; How could you do this, Father!? Why must you torment me so!?"},{"name":"DAD04660","text":"Know your place, girl! You are a means for our family to gain influence, and I won't have you sullying yourself with riffraff!"},{"name":"DAD04660","text":"You will not leave your chambers save with my permission, nor will you disobey me again. If you do so, there will be severe consequences. Am I understood?"},{"name":"DAD04660","text":"I said, am I understood!?"},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"...To hell."},{"name":"DAD04660","text":"What did you say?"},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"I said, go to hell!"},{"name":"DAD04660","text":"Aaarrrgggh!"},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"Oh, to think that it could be so exhilarating to speak my mind! To do as I please!"},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"No more living in a cage. From this moment on, I am free! Free as the wind!"},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)The young woman struck out on her own, and in her travels discovered her true calling─not in the halls of lords and ladies, but on the battlefield."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)She became a force of nature, famed for her striking beauty which belied a terrible savagery."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)And with this new life she also claimed a new name─Barbariccia."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"Indeed, she found her freedom, but did she also find happiness, I wonder...?"},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"I suppose I'll never know. Nor does it matter, for the world that once was is no more."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660C","text":"Oh, but goodness me. I had better rejoin the others."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"Ah, what a refreshing breeze."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"I'm to return to the others? Bah, <span class=\"emphasis\">they</span> should come <span class=\"emphasis\">here</span>!"},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"Would you look at this beautiful, boundless sky? Mortals take to the air from here, do they not? Would that I had wings to soar among the clouds myself..."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"But we voidsent are not wont to roam, you see. The mightiest among us carve out domains, while the rest labor to stay in their good graces."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"Now, the master of a domain seldom ventures outside, for it is in one's territory that one is strongest."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"For some, however, such confinement proved trying. As was the case for a certain voidsent I knew."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)I speak of the free-spirited terror, Barbariccia. When she first established her domain, she whiled away the days waiting for her minions to bring her prey."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)The aether amassed from these offerings was devoted to the singular pleasure of caring for her silky, flowing locks. But the resources of her domain were not without their limits."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)It was only when none remained to oppose her that she realized: she was a prisoner in her own domain. And unless she broke free, she would inevitably wither away, alone."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Not knowing what to do, she had fallen into the depths of despair...when the hand of salvation came to pull her out."},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"At this rate, my precious hair will frazzle and fray.

So much power, surging through me!"},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)And what will you do with it? What is it you desire?"},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"What I desire... What I desire is..."},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)You would move your very domain? Impressive."},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"That I can do such a thing... What have you done to me?"},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)I granted you aether, nothing more. It was your will that made it possible."},{"name":"WINDMONOLITH","text":"My will..."},{"name":"BLACKKNIGHT","text":"(-Knight in Black-)Even so, no matter where you should go, there is naught but Darkness.

I wish but to be free, like the wind."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)In a world that has met its end, rare indeed is the soul who desires freedom so ardently that she could will her very domain to move."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"(-Wayward Hecteye-)Recognizing this quality, the knight would grant her more power─and a place of command in his mighty army."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"A story worthy of our bargain, I trust. I might've had more to tell had I not fallen off her domain."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"It seems you mortals also have a fondness for flying. I'd certainly like to try riding one of these airships of yours..."},{"name":"VOIDSENT04660D","text":"But perhaps another time. My other selves will be a blubbering mess if I don't hurry and rejoin them."},{"name":"SCOUT04660","text":"The voidsent are all present and accounted for.
