Prior to Galla's departure, he was refusing to leave Tertium, and she believes the child is most likely still there. She petitions your aid in persuading the boy to join his countrymen at your camp, that he may benefit from the food and warmth on offer.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","Upon arriving at the station, Galla tells you a little more about the boy, in particular his name: Volusus. Although he is probably rather reluctant to cooperate, his distinctive scarlet locks should at least make him easy to locate.","You eventually find Volusus, and as he explains, he has no intention of going anywhere without his parents. He does, however, have something he wishes to discuss with you, and Galla urges you to hear him out in the hope he will eventually agree to join you at Camp Broken Glass."],"objectives":["Speak with Galla.","Search for Volusus."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GALLA","text":"I've seen you before... In Tertium, yes? I was part of the first group transferred here, but there's someone I'm trying to find. A small boy, red hair. Have you seen him?"},{"name":"GALLA","text":"Hmm... He's probably still refusing to budge."},{"name":"GALLA","text":"Oh, my apologies. Allow me to introduce myself: I'm Galla, Ist Legion. I've been doing what I can for the refugees...though I suppose I'm one myself."},{"name":"GALLA","text":"You see, I've always tried to help those in need─some call me a busybody, in fact. Before joining the military, I was a member of the Vigiles Urbani, and it was our duty to keep the citizenry safe. Old habits die hard, though, which is why I'm determined to look after that lad."},{"name":"GALLA","text":"He's been separated from his parents in the chaos, but he won't leave the station without them."},{"name":"GALLA","text":"Thing is, that's no place for a child his age to be fending for himself─you've seen the conditions there. He needs food and warmth, which you and yours have been kind enough to offer."},{"name":"GALLA","text":"I should go back to the station to try persuading him to join your camp.

You wouldn't think it'd be this hard to find someone with a shiny crop of red hair like his..."},{"name":"VOLUSUS","text":"Wh-Who are you?"},{"name":"GALLA","text":"Volusus! We've been looking everywhere for you! Still refusing to join everyone at the other camp, I see."},{"name":"VOLUSUS","text":"I'm not going anywhere.
