Unfortunately, the airship was bound for the northern reaches, which are not easily accessible from Camp Cloudtop. In order to pursue the Heavens' Ward, you and Alphinaud will need to enlist the aid of a bold airship captain─and Alphinaud knows the perfect candidate for the job.","Cid's cheery demeanor soon darkens when he learns of Lord Haurchefant's death and the archbishop's escape. Though he can offer no insight into the meaning of “Azys Lla,” he surmises that it is the source of some phenomenal cosmic power which Thordan VII covets. Recognizing the gravity of the threat, he agrees to help, and bids you join him at the airship landing when you are ready to depart."],"objectives":["Speak with Cid at the Skysteel Manufactory."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LUCIA","text":"The <span class=\"emphasis\">Soleil</span> was eastward bound, so I sent word to Camp Cloudtop on the off chance the airship passed nearby."},{"name":"LUCIA","text":"Sure enough, Lady Laniaitte informed me that it had been sighted by her scouts."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Then the archbishop is somewhere in the Sea of Clouds?"},{"name":"LUCIA","text":"Or <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span>, not long ago.
