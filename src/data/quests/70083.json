{"quest":{"name":"Hippo Healing","location":"Thavnair","id":70083,"patch":6.15,"sort":3,"icon":101172,"beast":15,"unlocksFunction":1,"eventIcon":71341,"issuer":1042300,"target":1042300,"genre":32,"journal":["Trna's boundless optimism is flagging slightly as her eyes dart anxiously among Svarna's shuffling hippos.<br>※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level.","The Hippo Riders' food delivery service is an instant success, which is phenomenal for their coffers, but hard on their hippos. Trna is expressing her concern over her hippos' health when she is interrupted by her frantic associate Ghasa, who was accosted by an armor-clad bandit and robbed of the meals he was delivering. After sending Ghasa out to redeliver the order, Trna asks you to accompany her to the Shroud of the Samgha in search of this mysterious food thief.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","The bandit has long since evanesced, as bandits are wont to do. Undeterred, you, Trna, and a decidedly sluggish Saurya search the area for clues of his whereabouts.","Instead of a bandit, you find two adorable hippo calves! Without any adult hippos present, they are in danger of falling prey to other wildlife, so you attempt to persuade them to follow you.","Relying on your superior skill in hippo linguistics─and the robust odor of hippo about your person─you manage to convince the calves to follow you. Together, you set off for the last known location of Trna, who will hopefully know how to handle this situation.<br><br>※You must be accompanied by the hippo calves to complete this task. Speak with them again should you become separated.","Trna is surprised by your adorable escorts, but admits she found no trace of the bandit either. She suggests heading to Palaka's Stand with the calves for the time being, where she expects to find Ghasa redelivering his order.","Ghasa is handing over the meal order when you arrive, and who should be accepting it but Ogul and Racashir! After squeaking a little at the mention of an armor-clad Arkasodara, Ogul assures you she will be on the lookout for nefarious characters. Ghasa heads for the watering holes up north in search of the calves' origins, while advising Trna to take them into her custody at Svarna.","Ghasa's findings implicate an unsavory Matanga in the hippo calves' abandonment by their herd, but while this information aligns with the profile of the grub-grabber from earlier, the trail has unfortunately grown cold. Anticipating the possibility of being accosted once more ere the case of the would-be hippo-napper can be solved, Maru and Ghasa team up to install comfortable stables and a modest wading pool in Svarna. The mysterious bandit may still be at large, but the Riders' hardworking hippos will now be well rested, relaxed, and ready to take on whatever challenges await them!"],"objectives":["Speak with Trna.","Survey the area for suspicious activity.","Speak with the energetic hippo calf and have the calves accompany you.","Accompany the hippo calves to Trna and speak with her.","Accompany the hippo calves to Palaka's Stand and speak with Trna again.","Speak with Trna in Svarna."],"dialogue":[{"name":"TRNA","text":"Happy to see you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I've actually got somethin' to tickle your thinker with. Hey Maru, get over here!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Startin' with the good news─looks like the hottest thing on Thavnair is Svarna's new tandoor! Folks can't get enough of our homemade grub."},{"name":"MARU","text":"Bein' able to eat whenever we want's about the best idea I ever came up with. All you really need in life is a kitchen."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Which brings us to our recent pickle─all the new business we're gettin' is really wearin' down our hippos. We can't afford to lay off the work, but my poor girl Saurya's got bags under her eyes..."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Do the hippos have comfy beds?"},{"name":"A1","text":"This calls for a dip in the spa."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Y'know, I've never given creature comforts much thought before...but if it's for our hippos, maybe it's time to start."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"(-???-)B-Boss! Boss!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Hm? Oh, if it ain't Ghasa. What're you doin' back so early? You're supposed to be out on delivery, ain't you?"},{"name":"GHASA","text":"That's just it, Boss! We got trouble. The order I was out deliverin'─it got snatched! Straight outta my arms!"},{"name":"GHASA","text":"Just when I enter the jungle, this bloke jumps out at me like I'm servin' two for one at his favorite meyhane!"},{"name":"GHASA","text":"I pull up so I don't ride straight into him, but he rushes me, grabs the food I'm holdin', an' takes off!"},{"name":"GHASA","text":"How dare he!? Stealin' my food and runnin' around in flashy armor, like he ain't gotta answer to nobody..."},{"name":"MARU","text":"Armor? A meal-moocher...wearin' armor?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Alright, alright. Forget that loon, Ghasa. Remake the order and get it delivered, on the double."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you up for stretchin' your legs? Let's see if we can't find this son of a bhujamga."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Good. I'll go an' hitch up Saurya..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"...If she'll even let me. How am I gonna convince her this time?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"...Like I said, we've got a thief to catch. Meet me over at the Shroud of the Samgha, and we'll see if he left any naan crumbs."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"Merciful Sisters! I just hope whoever's waitin' for this ain't got a temper..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Here you are. Perfect timin'."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Me and Saurya just made a sweep, but we didn't see nothin' outta the ordinary. "},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Not surprisin', of course. No thief I've ever met sticks around to face the music."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Anyway, see if you can pick up anythin' we might've missed. A jungle's always movin', after all. You never know what you might find."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Me and Saurya'll catch up in a little bit. Let me know if you find anythin' suspicious."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"Hey, Saurya... Be a good girl an' let's go, okay? You wanna see some pretty colors? Where's the gulal..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"As you survey the area for suspicious activity, you spot an armed Arkasodara...  "},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You recognize her as the hunter, Sula! She lifts her hand in salutation before disappearing into the jungle."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"As you survey the area for suspicious activity, some nearby leaves rustle and...a murderous asvattha appears! "},{"name":"HIPPOA","text":"(-Energetic Hippo Calf-)Pooohhhhhh!"},{"name":"HIPPOB","text":"(-Shy Hippo Calf-)P-Pohhh..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Your survey of the area yields not a suspicious person, but two adorable hippo calves. You may smell more like hippo than you think, because they cling to you as a comrade."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Without a herd to protect them, these two calves might easily fall prey to other wild beasts. It would be best to pause your search for now and accompany them to safety.  "},{"name":"HIPPOA","text":"Poh, pohhh!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This energetic hippo calf looks ready to follow you. It nudges the shy hippo calf beside it in encouragement."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Trna should know what to do..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Where's Saurya, you're wonderin'? Don't worry, she ain't got hippo-napped or nothin'. I'll tell you about it later, but for now, let's keep lookin' for our bandit!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"How'd it... Wait, where'd you get those hippos!?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Don't tell me you're the type that can't help pickin' up strays if they look at you all winsome-like. "},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Nothin' suspicious save these little 'pots, huh? Strange there weren't other hippos, though..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Me an' Saurya also made an odd find─a Radiant who'd gotten smacked around by a beast─but no sign of our thief. Anyway, I bundled 'em into the cart an' sent Saurya off to Palaka's Stand."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Let's head over as well. Ghasa should be there with his delivery by now, an' I wanna get his account again."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Bring those calves while you're at it. It's too dangerous to leave 'em out here alone."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"S-Sorry to keep you waitin'! Two Hippo Rider Specials─fast, fresh, an' ready to eat!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Oh! At last, I partake in the famed Hippo Rider Special! The spicy tandoori prawns...the sumptuous fish tikka!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"If only Grandmother could see me now, ordering fresh fish in the custom of the locals..."},{"name":"RACASHIR","text":"Teacher really seems to like Thavnairian cuisine. I wonder if it's very different from her homeland's... "},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Hey, where'd the juniors go? Make sure they get here safe, will you?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Looks like that Radiant got back safe. One of their friends just thanked me."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Greetings, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Yezahn tells me you've taken to the shipping trade?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"You sure do know everybody, don't you?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Apologies for the delay of your delivery─some scoundrel ran off with the first batch we sent."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"What's this island comin' to that Arkasodara can't even trust each other not to act like two-gil thieves? An' that's not even gettin' into the bugger's poor taste in armor... Anyway, we're terribly sorry to have kept you waitin', miss."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Think nothing of it! It was only the most minor of delays."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I'm more worried about this scoundrel you mentioned. I've been patrolling this area for some time, and this is the first I've heard of an Arkasodara..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Wearing...armor? Oh, no. Mother forfend..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"I-In any case, I'll be sure to keep my eyes extra sharp whilst patrolling! We can't have M-Matanga running wild and pilfering prawns, now, can we?"},{"name":"RACASHIR","text":"You're making an odd squeaking noise, did you know? And your tikka is getting cold..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Right you are, young Racashir! Let us eat. As Grandmother used to say, “An empty stomach leads to forest fires”! Or was it “friendly fire”? Forgive me, I feel faint."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"After we partake of these delicious meals, we shall scour the jungle for any nefarious suspects. I will send word if we find anything."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"So? Are you gonna introduce me, or should I skip straight to the cuddlin'?"},{"name":"GHASA","text":"They were alone!? Usually calves this young are glued to their parents, but you're sayin' there were no other hippos around?"},{"name":"GHASA","text":"My deliveries are done, so why don't I go and have a look 'round the waterin' holes up north? See if my expert eye don't pick up somethin' useful."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"Truth be told, these darlin's probably smell too much like us to be goin' back to their herd now. Take 'em home so we can make sure they grow up right, will you, Boss?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Ghasa can be a hot-head, but he's a real hippo whisperer. Ain't no one knows 'em better."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I'll take the juniors back to Svarna. Stop by later when you get the chance."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"The calves are makin' themselves right at home. Nothin' better than havin' a herd, after all."},{"name":"MARU","text":"You went out lookin' for a bandit an' brought back hippo calves instead? You're pretty bad at findin' things, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. But they sure are cute..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"The master returns! Find anythin'?"},{"name":"GHASA","text":"I searched high an' low, Boss, but there's not a hippo to be had for gil or glory. Judgin' by their tracks, the herd must've up an' left in a hurry."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"So you think the calves got left behind in the scramble..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I reckon nothin' short of an outright blaze would be enough to separate cow from calf, but I ain't heard news of any fires recently..."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"Somethin' else might have done it, Boss─or some<span class=\"emphasis\">one</span>. I found tracks that looked an awful lot like an Arkasodara's."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"A rival Hippo Rider?"},{"name":"A2","text":"A hippo poacher!?"},{"name":"GHASA","text":"If it is, they're still short a hippo. Looked to me like the hippos cleared off before whoever it was got close enough to snatch one."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"Can't rule it out, to be sure. Thankfully, I didn't find no grisly bits or nothin', so either way, the hippos probably got away safely."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"In any case, we've got a no-good, grub-grabbin', hippo-harassin' lowlife on our hands. We've gotta be extra careful till we catch this bandit!"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Maybe so, but us Hippo Riders are professionals now. We can't let nothin' stop us from deliverin'..."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"Son of a bhujamga! The creature comforts!"},{"name":"MARU","text":"Boss? You feelin' alright?"},{"name":"TRNA","text":"I am, but our hippos ain't! If this thief comes anglin' for our deliveries again an' the hippos are too tired to haul themselves outta there, we're done for."},{"name":"TRNA","text":"An' I'm not feelin' great about our odds, seein' as even Saurya was tippin' me the cold shoulder earlier. I thought I'd hafta pull <span class=\"emphasis\">her</span> in the cart. "},{"name":"GHASA","text":"If it's rest our poor 'pots need, then our first order of business is a proper sleepin' stable. Long overdue, if you ask me. An' for our new additions, a wadin' pool─it's safer if they can swim right at home."},{"name":"MARU","text":"I guess we could fix up that old fishpond an' make a splash. It ain't deep enough for the bigger hippos, though."},{"name":"GHASA","text":"It's better than nothin'! An' we can't keep 'em cooped up in Svarna all the time anyway─that's no good for the hippo soul. May as well take 'em out for proper bathin' excursions."},{"name":"MARU","text":"I guess they <span class=\"emphasis\">are</span> the ones doin' most of the legwork─but this ain't no small project, Ghasa. You better be helpin' me build all of this..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Thanks to Maru and Ghasa's exhaustive efforts, Svarna has a new stable and wading pool!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The Hippo Riders are now known as “unique” couriers, which is presumably an improvement.
