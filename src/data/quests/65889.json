You also learn that the succubus was seen leaving a local alehouse with several smitten maidens. Report your findings to Cocobuki, who is waiting at the center of Vesper Bay.","After explaining Mormo's grim purpose for the women she has seduced, Cocobuki bids you seek out the Lominsan adventurers said to be accompanying the treacherous voidsent.

Speak with the wounded marauder to find out where Cocobusi may be heading.","You learn from the marauder that his thaumaturge companion has been dragged further north, into the caverns of Moondrip.

Fortune has favored us, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>: Cocobusi has been spotted at Vesper Bay."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"We cannot let this opportunity pass us by! Head there with all due haste. And with you, take these descriptions of my brother's likeness and Mormo's mannerisms. Relay this information to some of the local residents and see what you can find."},{"name":"MOBA","text":"Hm? Somethin' I can do for you, stranger?"},{"name":"MOBA","text":"Now that you mention it, I <span class=\"emphasis\">did</span> see a Lalafell who matches this description. He was watchin' the ferries come in with more than a passin' interest. Lookin' to hire some adventurers or some such, I reckon."},{"name":"MOBB","text":"Welcome to the Pissed Peiste, love! What can I get ye?"},{"name":"MOBB","text":"Ah, information, is it? Aye, that little bloke was in here, bringin' a blush to all the young maidens' cheeks. What he lacked in height, he certainly made up for in boldness! Left with more than one lass on his arm, he did."},{"name":"MOBC","text":"What's that, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">son</span></span>? You say you're looking for someone?"},{"name":"MOBC","text":"Hmmm. I believe I saw your Lalafell in the company of a couple adventurers hailing from Limsa Lominsa─a marauder and a thaumaturge, were I to hazard a guess. I think they were talking about seeing the area north of here..."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"I have enlisted the assistance of my brothers in questioning the locals, but I fear they are unsuited to such subtle endeavors. Our plans rest upon <span class=\"emphasis\">your</span> efforts, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Hm hm hm... So, Mormo has chosen this as her new hunting ground."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"The maidens seduced by the succubus will be prepared as vessels to hold her fully restored power; I fear they will have already been slain. As for the adventurers, well, I think you can imagine what Mormo intends for the thaumaturge."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"We must find and warn those unwitting Lominsans before the voidsent strikes again. You were told that they might be headed north, yes? It would be best for you to follow suit."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Pray do not wait on me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I must gather my brothers before doing aught else. Hurry northward and warn those unsuspecting Lominsans of the danger."},{"name":"POP","text":"You sense a hostile presence!"},{"name":"ADV","text":"&lt;groan&gt; Still here...

If the bargaining proceeds smoothly, and the voidsent feasts on my proffered mana, then she should soon manifest in her demonic form."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Once Mormo is fully present within this realm, that is when you unleash the seething power of the abyss!"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"...Though after lecturing for so long on how a thaumaturge should avoid such threats, I yet hold doubts as to whether such a direct conflict is the correct path."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, in your experience, what do you consider to be a thaumaturge's greatest strength?"},{"name":"Q","text":"What is a thaumaturge's greatest strength?"},{"name":"A","text":"Overwhelming destructive might!"},{"name":"A","text":"...Introspection."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Yes, there are none who can match our propensity for fiery ruin. We need not run from danger, but rather employ our unrivaled powers to incinerate all that seek to do us harm."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Hm hm hm... Yes, indeed, it is perhaps only by looking within that we may find the answers we seek."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"I am decided. My fate awaits me. I have faith that, no matter what becomes of me, you shall succeed in destroying Mormo, ending her threat to this realm."},{"name":"COCOBYGO","text":"&lt;twitch&gt; The big battle at last, eh? It really is quite thrilling! ...Really!"},{"name":"COCOBANI","text":"Are you ready? You seem ready. <span class=\"emphasis\">I stand ready</span>!

S-Solid as an adamantoise!"},{"name":"COCOBOHA","text":"Bwaha...ha... &lt;sigh&gt; Is it normal to be this nervous?"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Enough, Mormo!"},{"name":"SUCCUBUS","text":"Well, well. If it isn't the eldest of the COWARDLY thaumaturge brothers. I thought you'd be busy whimpering under your bed, wishing that I'd just DISAPPEAR."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"I've come to offer you a deal. I know you seek the aetheric energy needed to substantiate your true form...but how much time do you intend to waste, feeding on these lesser mages?"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Compared to these stripling sorcerers and their trembling arcane flames, my power is as a blazing sun. Would you not prefer to take what I can give you?"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Drain my strength, and assume your rightful appearance. I am sure you think me a coward, but that is of no consequence. I only wish Cocobusi returned to us unharmed."},{"name":"SUCCUBUS","text":"Hee hee hee! You are WISE to acquiesce, mage!"},{"name":"SUCCUBUS","text":"Hee hee hee! At LAST! At long last, my true body─my true POWER─is mine once more! I believe a stretching of the old arcane muscles is in order..."},{"name":"COCOBYGO","text":"Oh! Oh no you don't, v-voidsent!"},{"name":"COCOBOHA","text":"We won't let you leave here alive!"},{"name":"SUCCUBUS","text":"Hee hee hee! So, you risk your LIVES in a valiant rescue attempt? You should not bet what you are not prepared to LOSE! I shall tear the aether from your very MARROW!"},{"name":"COCOBYGO","text":"...We won?"},{"name":"COCOBANI","text":"We won! Victory is ours! Cocobusi! Cocobuki! Mormo is dead!"},{"name":"COCOBUSI","text":"&lt;groan&gt; What...? Where am I?"},{"name":"COCOBUBEZI","text":"Thank Thal, you're awake. Cocobuki! Cocobusi is returned to us!"},{"name":"COCOBOHA","text":"Our...our sibling has yet to stir from his somnolent stupor."},{"name":"COCOBUSI","text":"Buki!?"},{"name":"COCOBUSI","text":"His aetheric channels have contracted─they are barely sufficient to sustain the flow of his life force. If we do not increase his capacity for aether soon, his vitality will drain away completely."},{"name":"COCOBUSI","text":"...My mana-amplifying potion. Its potency is limited, but it just might be enough!"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"I see the battle ended...as I expected..."},{"name":"COCOBYGO","text":"Y-You did it, Cocobusi! Your alchemy saved him!"},{"name":"COCOBYGO","text":"And we would not have prevailed without you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! We will bear our brother back to the Ossuary─pray meet us there that we might properly express our gratitude!"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. After seeking refuge in the comforting shadows of the abyss for so long, I had lost sight of the blazing glory of which thaumaturgy is capable."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"The raw power and audacity of your magecraft has freed my brothers and me from our self-imposed cowardice."},{"name":"COCOBOHA","text":"I thought Thal Himself had His fingers at my throat... But this sensation of hard-won supremacy is strangely satisfying!"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"As for you, Cocobusi: you are our brother, and our respected colleague. I hope you never again underestimate the precious power you wield."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you have exceeded all my expectations. In recognition of your outstanding growth as a thaumaturge, I shall impart to you one of the guild's most closely guarded techniques:"},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Manaward.

I am sure you can understand why we do not teach this secret to every stray hedge wizard who chooses to join our ranks."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"Now that you have experienced the deadliest threats─and the joy that comes with their obliteration─I am certain you are eager to explore just how deep you might descend into the chasm of thaumaturgy."},{"name":"COCOBUKI","text":"May your struggles bring wisdom, and your wisdom bring courage.
