Though such a trial must be as a relaxing diversion compared to your usual endeavors, it was still an impressive display."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Did you know that Kholusia's rich in sulphur? Well, it is. We've been minin' the stuff since ancient times."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"And every so often, the selfsame veins yield what's called earthseed, a rare ore steeped in magick."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Time was, we used to refine earthseed for this and that, but the technique's been lost. The stuff's still out there to be had, though, provided you know where to look. And no place is surer'n the Duergar's Tewel."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Problem is, the site's occupied by our age-old rivals─the Goggs. Greedy sods claim the place is theirs, and refuse to let any other bugger near!"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Oh, there never was a more odious lot than them Goggs. I could go on forever about those hornless whoresons... But then we'd be here forever, and that won't get us nowhere."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"What it boils down to is this: if you want the earthseed, you've got to deal with the Goggs. Reckon you're up to the challenge?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"We have dealt with far worse. I am sure we can find a way to obtain what we need."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"That's the spirit! Now, to help you find your way, I'll have one of ours go with you."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"(-???-)I'll do it! I'll go with them!"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"You, Korutt!?"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"I couldn't help overhearing. I knew the eaters had flocked to Mt. Gulg, but I didn't know why. To think the last Lightwarden's hiding up there..."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"The fate of Kholusia─no, the world─hangs in the balance. If I can be of some help, then I want to do my part!"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Your zeal is commendable, lad, but it isn't so simple..."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"This here's Korutt. Young as he is, he's one of the village's finest miners. The lad's got an uncanny sense of where to dig, and his aim with a pickaxe is as true as any dwarf's."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"But put him in the thick of battle, and he couldn't hit the side of a mine cart if he was sitting in it."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"If all he needed to do was dig, he'd be your dwarf, but he's liable to become a sin eater's breakfast before he can even manage a swing."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"It's true... I'm hopeless in a fight..."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"But I still want to try! Please! Please let me go with you!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"I take care of you, you take care of the ore."},{"name":"A1","text":"As long as you're aware of the dangers."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Oh, thank you so much! I'll try my best not to be a burden!"},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"If you want to take Korutt, far be it from me to stop you. Keep him safe, though, will you?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"We will most assuredly encounter sin eaters along the way."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Though, with you in our company, they will be more a spectacle than a concern."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"See to your preparations, my friend. We will depart as soon as you are ready."},{"name":"XAMOTT","text":"Seriously, though, take care of Korutt. Lad's weaker'n a pint of pisswater."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"The Duergar's Tewel lies in a cave to the east. I'm ready when you are!"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Uwaaah!"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"J-Just as we're about to get there!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"One last push, then. Shall we, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"'Twas a near thing in the end, but what matters is that we pulled through. Well fought, my friend."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"We're alive! We're aliiive!"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Let's hurry inside before any more sin eaters come!"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"We'll keep to the road and head east. I'm in your hands!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"It seems we have a fair distance to cover. Be on your guard for sin eaters."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Speak of the devils... <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, the one on the left is yours."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"See that Korutt comes to no harm."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Amazing! You two are really strong!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Ah heh... It may interest you to know that <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> is a great hero in the land whence <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> hails. Some would say the <span class=\"emphasis\">greatest</span>."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Really</span>? Oh, you must have some stories to tell, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"That <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> does. Tales to impress and inspire you in turn. By all means, have <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> regale you with a few once our work is done."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Heh heh, I can't wait!"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Aaah! More of them!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Stay behind us, Korutt."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"B-But they're behind us too!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, focus on the enemy. I will protect our charge."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Phew... I don't know much about fighting, but you two make a great team!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> is a team unto <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>self. I merely follow <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> lead."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Well, it looks like you've been doing this for years to me!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"...Is that so? I...I shall take that as a compliment."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Um...did I say the wrong thing?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Not at all. Your words are most heartening. Indeed, I feel like a young man again."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"You talk as if you're old! How long have you two known each other, anyway?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Well..."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Uwaaah! There's even more of them!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"This is too close to Amity for comfort. Let's finish them quickly and move on."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"H-Hurry, this way!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"How much farther to the cave?"},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Not far. It's just past this rise."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Ah, I believe I see it."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"Uwaaah! <span class=\"emphasis\">Again</span>!?"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"It appears we are surrounded..."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Fortunately, I have a little trick for such occasions."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, draw them in!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"'Tis done. Let us press on."},{"name":"KORUTT","text":"R-Right!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"I will shield Korutt! Give the eaters everything you have!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"I will ward off the attack! Stand with Korutt, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Not good... Quickly, spread out!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"It appears the commotion drew this one out. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─time to bring all to bear!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Ungh... Not now..."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Your tale will not end here!"},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Concentrate on the ones coming for Korutt!
