Quickly skimming through its contents, you learn that Cemi has arrived at Namai in Yanxia without incident. While she seems to be enjoying her stay there, a great portion of what she writes is dedicated to food. Perhaps it would be best if you were to depart for Namai posthaste and remind her of the purpose of her journey there─to continue her studies on oriental furniture.","While initially Cemi is unable to speak of anything but food, a stern reminder from you is all that is needed to set her back on track. Once more the two of you decide to begin searching for anyone who might be in need of help.","You come across a man by the name of Reizan, who was a chef in pre-imperial Doma. As the Garleans' grip on the lands weaken, he is looking to fulfill his lifelong dream of opening a restaurant. With limited funds, however, it has been difficult for him to acquire the furniture he needs. Cemi jumps at the chance to volunteer, adding that she would like to turn this into a competition between you and her to see who can better satisfy the client. Reizan does not oppose the idea, and requests that you make something to accommodate the dining habits of both enclave and country folk. To determine exactly what that might be, he suggests you speak with the local residents.","Upon speaking with the nearby citizens, you learn that people from the enclave will only dine in a private setting, as they consider it rude to do so before strangers. This information should help you to decide on a suitable item to craft for Reizan. Perhaps now would be a good time to seek out Cemi that you might discuss ideas with her and receive the necessary materials.","Upon hearing that you intend to craft partitions, Cemi begins hurling accusations at you, convinced that you would never deign to create anything that simple unless you were attempting to lose on purpose. A simple explanation quickly calms her, and she apologizes. Handing you the materials you may need, she leaves you to make high-quality ornate partitions for Reizan.<br><br>※In the event you lose the materials or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Cemi.","Just as your client is about to decide on a winner, Timbermaster Beatin swoops in and begins offering his expert opinion. Though he declares that both are finely crafted, he refrains from further comment. All of you then turn your attention to Reizan. The chef declares that from the first moment, he knew your creation was the one he preferred, as it fulfills his request for something that would allow both enclave and country folk to dine in comfort. The competition now over, Beatin bids both you and Cemi return to Gridania.","Over the course of her studies in the Far East, Cemi has come to realize the importance of listening to her clients and adapting her furniture to suit their wants and needs. Having this most important of lessons firmly instilled within her, Timbermaster Beatin is confident that she will become a better carpenter for it. He thanks you for inspiring his young apprentice and asks you to speak with her one last time before you leave.","Cemi excitedly tells you that the timbermaster has deemed her worthy of taking on clients. While fulfilling commissions, she also plans to continue practicing making oriental furniture so as not to forget all that she learned during her stay in the Far East. It seems she looks up to you a great deal and hopes that she will one day become a master carpenter like you.<br><br>※The next carpenter quest will be available from Cemi upon reaching level 70."],"objectives":["Speak with Cemi Jinjahl in Namai.","Search for troubled villagers.","Speak with the residents of Namai.","Speak with Cemi Jinjahl.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize an ornate partition <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"></span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the ornate partition <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Reizan</span></span>.","Return to the Carpenters' Guild in Gridania.","Speak with Cemi Jinjahl."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KOTOKAZE","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!

Every day I stumble across something new─whether it be the unusual materials they employ in their construction or the unfamiliar but delicious foods."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHLLATTER","text":"(-Letter from Cemi-)Oh, yes, the food here is exquisite, and their desserts are even better. In fact, the sugar-coated dumplings they have are simply to die for!"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHLLATTER","text":"(-Letter from Cemi-)I'll be sure to treat you to some when you come.

It's been far too long."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Have you tried any of the local cuisine yet? If you haven't, I know the perfect place for us to start."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"I-I was planning to take you there purely to discuss business, I swear! After all, where better to do that than over food?"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Gah!"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"All right, all right! Your disapproval has been duly noted. Instead of going for food, let us search out any people who might be in need of our assistance, then."},{"name":"KOTOKAZE","text":"Ah, the Culinarians' Guild must be extremely proud to have a member as passionate about food as Cemi. She is sure to make a fine chef one day."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Help? Yes, I could use some of that."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"You see, in the days before the Empire held dominion over our lands, I was a chef. While our freedom from them is fleeting, I would nevertheless like to use this opportunity to once again pursue my passion for cooking. As such, I have been thinking to open up my own restaurant."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"You see, in the days before the Empire held dominion over our lands, I was a chef. I hold out hope that one day, when the imperial forces are driven from our country, I will be free to pursue my passion, once more. When that time comes, I wish to start up my own restaurant."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"To do so, I would need to procure basic furnishings for my future shop. It is not a simple task. Most of what I have come across is either far too expensive or of poor quality."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Then you may be pleased to hear, sir, that before you stand two highly skilled members of the Carpenters' Guild in Gridania. We shall see that you receive the furniture you require."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"You would do this for me?"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Most certainly. What kind of furnishings do you need?"},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Apart from tables and chairs, I need something that would allow my guests to feel at ease. Those from the enclave have different dining habits to those of us here in Namai. I would like to create an environment where both would feel equally welcome."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Please, leave it to us, sir. Now, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, what do you say to making things a tad more interesting? Let's turn this into a competition."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"We will each make something for our client and present the finished product to him. He will then judge them and decide on a winner."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Pretty, pretty please─won't you do it for me? This is the only way I can show Timbermaster Beatin I'm just as skilled as all the other carpenters in the guild."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Haha! It's settled then!"},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Go about making the furniture however you will, but I recommend you speak with the people here before getting started. Some have lived here their entire lives, others once lived in the enclave. With their help you may better understand the subtle differences in our ways."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Thank you, sir, we'll be sure to do that. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, once you've decided what you'll be making, come and find me. I'll furnish you with any materials you might need."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Hello? Is there anyone out there seeking the services of a young carpenter? Anyone at all?"},{"name":"INAGARA","text":"I would say that the people from the enclave are more elegant than us─never seen one with a hair out of place or in clothes that have not been neatly pressed. They place great importance on rules, manners, and fashion over there."},{"name":"MANAZURU","text":"Yes. I suppose you could say I am from the enclave, though I have lived here for most of my life. When I was young, my family and I fled to this village that we might escape imperial troops."},{"name":"MANAZURU","text":"Wh-What? You would like for me to <span class=\"emphasis\">demonstrate</span> the difference in dining habits!?"},{"name":"MANAZURU","text":"Hmph. I am afraid that is not something I can help you with."},{"name":"MIYAKE","text":"The only difference is that table manners are practically nonexistent out here. The people have good hearts, but they have no sense of etiquette. They will eat their food on the streets and sip their tea in front of you!"},{"name":"MIYAKE","text":"One should take their meals behind closed doors with family or friends. &lt;sigh&gt; It would be nice if they would at least eat behind a partition of some sort and spare the rest of us the sight..."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Your friend─she is full to the brim with energy."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, remember to come and pick up your materials from me once you've decided on what you're going to make."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Have you finally decided on what you'll be making?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"I'll be building the entire restaurant from the ground up!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"A wooden shield to protect the food from, well, you know..."},{"name":"Q1","text":"Ornate partitions that can be hung between each of the tables."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Have you lost your mind? You're an amazing carpenter, but even you wouldn't be able to manage such a feat in so little time."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Protect the food from what exactly? That doesn't sound like a place anyone would feel comfortable to dine at..."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"...Partitions? But that seems so...dull. That's not what you're <span class=\"emphasis\">really</span> thinking to make is it?"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"...Wait! You're not trying to lose on purpose, are you?"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"While I know I'm not yet as good as you, never did I think that you saw me as so far beneath you that you would feel the need to do <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span>..."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"My apologies. It seems I jumped to conclusions again. I know you're not the type of person to do something like that."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"It's no excuse, but lately I've been on edge. I can't shake the feeling this is my last chance to convince Timbermaster Beatin that I am a capable carpenter, worthy of being called as such. If I don't, he might stop assigning me work, and I may as well leave the guild."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"I shall not let it come to that! No matter what it takes, I must find a way prove myself."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Oh, I completely forgot! I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to blabber on about my worries. After all, you're here for materials, aren't you?"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Here you are. Feel free to come back if it's not enough."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Is your friend always so...excitable?"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"You misplaced the materials I gave you? &lt;sigh&gt;"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"I guess one of the many perks of being a master carpenter is that you need not be subjected to long lectures when you lose things..."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Well, here you are. Now I really must return to my work, so please do take care not to misplace your materials again."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Please, take your partitions to Reizan. I'll also make my way to him shortly."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Hm? What have we here?"},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Ahem. May I..."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Timbermaster Beatin!"},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"This table is exquisite. It is extremely sturdy, yet manages to maintain a sleek elegance. ...And these Doman-style engravings that run up and down the sides of the legs─if I did not know better I would guess they were the work of a more practiced pair of hands than your own, Cemi."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Now, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, let us see yours. Ah... Simple but all the more stunning for it. The lacquer finish is a nice touch─a light gloss that is just enough to enhance the natural blush of the wood, but not overpower it."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"While both of these are masterpieces in their own right, I will say this: the detailed engravings on the table are something even a highly skilled artisan would struggle to recreate."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"What do you think, sir?"},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"The moment I saw it, I knew which one of these I wanted─desperately needed, even. I choose..."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"This one!"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"That <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> is a better carpenter than me, I won't deny. That <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> has skills I could only ever dream of attaining, I'll also admit... But I...I poured my heart and soul into that table!"},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Sir, why is it that you chose <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s partitions over Cemi's table?"},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Simple, really. Doman city folk are a private sort. They would appreciate the way these wooden barriers would hide them from sight as they eat."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"The young lady's table is magnificent─a work of art, even. However, it does not fulfill the needs of my customers like these partitions do."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"It seems the time it took to carve the intricate detailing on this table would have been better spent interviewing the local citizens."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Cemi, do you understand now why it is you lost? You were so focused on demonstrating your own skill that you disregarded the needs of the client."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, on the other hand, spoke with the residents of this village, which inspired <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> to create these partitions─a product that places the customer's needs above all else."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"In that sense, the difference between your table and <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> partitions is the difference between a decent carpenter and a master of the craft."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"That said, this is where your journey ends. I expect to see the both of you back in Gridania shortly after I return."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"No... No, it can't be. Please tell me Timbermaster Beatin hasn't given up on me. Oh, what am I to do?"},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Is your friend all right? While I cannot claim to understand what any of that was about, I would like to thank you for your wonderful contribution. It is sure to suit my restaurant perfectly."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"You've finished? Already? Well, what are you waiting for─take it to Reizan. I'll join the two of you shortly."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Opening up a restaurant has always been a dream of mine. To think that it might soon be within my grasp fills me with joy beyond belief."},{"name":"CUSTOMERA02444","text":"Timbermaster Beatin, thank the Matron you've returned! The drawers of this desk you made for me are broken. Is there a chance they can be fixed?"},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"I shall see what can be done. After all, I can hardly say no to someone who has so cherished one of my creations as you have."},{"name":"CUSTOMERB02444","text":"Timbermaster Beatin, sir. My son─he's just been accepted into the Order of the Twin Adder. To celebrate, I'd like to have you craft him a fine spear."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Order of the Twin Adder... That is quite the accomplishment. Very well. I shall make him a one that will see him through all his battles."},{"name":"CUSTOMERC02444","text":"Wait, sir! Come back! &lt;sigh&gt; I also had a request for him, but I suppose it'll have to wait. I should have known getting the finest carpenter in all of Gridania to make something for you wasn't going to be an easy task."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Excuse me. Um... If you don't mind my asking, why is it that all of you like Timbermaster Beatin so much?"},{"name":"CUSTOMERC02444","text":"When you ask him to make something, he creates that item for you and you alone."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"To make something for that person and that person alone... Thinking back, that's how I first got into carpentry."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"I was born into a family poorer than dirt─one where we couldn't afford to purchase even the most basic of furniture."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"My mother raised us by herself, working from dawn until dusk so that my sisters and I wouldn't go to bed hungry every night. As a result, she pushed herself too hard and one day, the pain in her back became too much to bear."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"Seeing her suffering drove me to make her an armchair in which she could rest from time to time. It was all the young me could think to do."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"While the finished product creaked and buckled under her weight, not for a single moment as I was making it did I lose sight of the fact that I was doing it all for her."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"I've been so preoccupied with myself─with trying to prove my skills─that somewhere along the way I forgot the most important thing..."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"It is never too late to remember and begin anew..."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Cemi, the key to harnessing your own potential is to recognize what is holding you back. From here, you can only grow."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"...Yes. Yes, sir! You're absolutely right. There is still hope for me."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, thank you for supporting me until now. It is only because of you that I have come this far."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"In fact, I'd go so far as to say that our grand adventures together have made me feel as though I've been born again. I am looking forward to exploring the world of carpentry once more!"},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"She is not the only one who owes you a debt of gratitude. While I am skilled at working with wood, I am not nearly so adept at dealing with people and their problems. You have helped Cemi in ways I could not."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"You are part of the reason I have such high hopes for the girl. With a mentor like you to look up to, she will no doubt flourish. That is why I ask that you speak with her one last time before you leave."},{"name":"REIZAN","text":"Thank you for all your help. If you ever come back for a visit, do be sure to stop by my new restaurant."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you'll be happy to hear that Timbermaster Beatin has finally deemed my work good enough to begin taking on some of my own clients! Isn't it so exciting?"},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"That's not to say I'll forget about my studies or the guild's troubles, however. In between commissions, I'll be spending my time practicing how to make oriental furniture. That way, I can retain all that I learned from our trips to Kugane and Namai."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"But that's not all. I'll be keeping the people we met there in mind. They'll help me to remember that I am making this furniture not for myself, but for those around me."},{"name":"CEMIJINJAHL","text":"You'll see, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I'm going to work so hard that one day, I'll be as good as you."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Cemi has stumbled across the secret to becoming a true craftsman. While she may be but a seed now, it shall not be long until she begins to bud. I look forward to seeing just how she blossoms."}],"reward":{"gil":2539,"items":[{"num":250,"id":10},{"id":19559},{"id":5703,"one":1},{"id":5708,"one":1},{"id":5713,"one":1}],"xp":2902500},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":9}],"quests":[67979]},"next":[67981]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1019002","obj":{"i":1019002,"n":"Kotokaze","l":2404,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020901","obj":{"i":1020901,"n":"Cemi Jinjahl","l":52,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000153","obj":{"i":1000153,"n":"Beatin","l":52,"q":25,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019256","obj":{"i":1019256,"n":"Inagara","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019257","obj":{"i":1019257,"n":"Miyake","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019258","obj":{"i":1019258,"n":"Manazuru","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019279","obj":{"i":1019279,"n":"Reizan","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020913","obj":{"i":1020913,"n":"Cemi Jinjahl","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020914","obj":{"i":1020914,"n":"Cemi Jinjahl","l":2410,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"19559","obj":{"i":19559,"n":"Doman Steel Claw Hammer","l":260,"c":35065,"t":13,"p":37065}},{"type":"item","id":"5703","obj":{"i":5703,"n":"Craftsman's Competence Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":11,"attr":"Craftsmanship","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"5708","obj":{"i":5708,"n":"Craftsman's Cunning Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"CP","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"5713","obj":{"i":5713,"n":"Craftsman's Command Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":7,"attr":"Control","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"17881","obj":{"i":17881,"n":"Partition Materials","l":285,"c":22471,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"17882","obj":{"i":17882,"n":"Ornate Partition","l":285,"c":52604,"t":63}},{"type":"quest","id":"67979","obj":{"i":67979,"n":"A Lesson in Listening","g":136,"l":"Kugane","s":650,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67981","obj":{"i":67981,"n":"Tea Party Rules","g":136,"l":"Gridania","s":700,"f":1}}]}
