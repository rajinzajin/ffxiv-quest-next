We faced the crown prince himself and lived to tell the tale!"},{"name":"ISSE","text":"You've no idea what this means for us. Everyone's talking about getting more weapons and armor and...and..."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"And we're not going to stop until we've taken back our homeland!"},{"name":"ISSE","text":"Ah, right. Getting a bit ahead of ourselves, aren't we? We've got wounded to tend to first. We should get back to the village!"},{"name":"ISSE","text":"How are you feeling? After fighting that demon, I can only imagine..."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"...I suppose I ought to apologize to you. For...you know..."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"Anyway, uh... Thank you. For not giving up on us. The shinobi too."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"In the meantime, how shall I occupy myself..."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"I will be traveling to the Azim Steppe, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"I found Lord Hien once before, and I am confident I can do so again. Moreover, it was to me whom he put the question of Doma's resolve. I feel it my duty to deliver to him our people's reply."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"My injuries are of no moment. You need not fear for me."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Our countrymen's deeds speak for themselves. Lord Hien cannot deny the truth of their hearts."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Too long has it been since I looked on his face. It would be of great comfort to see him again─and no small comfort if you were to join us in the search, I should add!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"I will wait no longer to greet my young lord and master! Nay, I should be glad to accompany Yugiri and bring him back home!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I wonder what kind of man Hien is. From what I heard, he's about the same age as me. And then there's Fordola, who isn't a whole lot younger than us both..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Like her, he was born and raised in an imperial province. This is all he's ever known. But unlike her, he chose to do something about it..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I want to meet him. I want to know why. Maybe, if I understand that, it'll help me to understand a lot of other things..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I don't think I could stand waiting around for them to get back. I want to go too."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"The beloved king returning to urge his countrymen to rise up in rebellion. Not a story you'd ever hear in Sharlayan or Ul'dah, is it?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Not in those words, perhaps, but no land's people is so cynical to be wholly immune to inspiration. Singular individuals have the power to move hearts and minds no matter where they go."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Mmmhm. Doubtless you speak from personal experience."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"As much as this Lord Hien intrigues us, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, there are vital tasks to be attended to here─preparations for the inevitable assault on Doma Castle, for one."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"There is also the matter of coordinating our efforts with the Confederacy and our comrades in Kugane, dealing with this troublesome aetheryte─I could go on, but you understand."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"As I said before, we've a million things to do here. Much as Alphinaud and I would love to join the search, we cannot. Right, Brother?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...Aye, so it goes. We all have our responsibilities."},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"We shall depart for the Azim Steppe at once."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"You will be joining us, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"For our part, we shall do what we can to aid the Doman Liberation Front in your absence."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We will refrain from conducting any large-scale operations in your absence, and instead devote our energies to bolstering our ranks and training our new recruits. When you return, we will be ready for war."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"If anything happens, if you need us to come back sooner, you'd better contact us. “Noble sacrifices” are a last resort, remember?"},{"name":"YUGIRI","text":"Follow me, my friends. We have many malms to travel before we reach Reunion."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"Wait! Don't leave yet!"},{"name":"ISSE","text":"Here, take these for the road. It's simple fare, but it's the least we can do for you, after what you did for us."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"...It may be stupid and naive of me to say this, but I will."},{"name":"ISSE","text":"When you come back, we'll finish what we started. We'll beat the imperials and we'll win our freedom!
