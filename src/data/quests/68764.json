I could use an ear if you have a moment to listen..."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Now, between your craft and my negotiations, we've managed to secure contracts with the Zun, the Mord, and even the Ondo. Compared to our previous client list of one whole customer, business has improved by leaps and bounds."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"It's just...after paying regular wages to Eismon and putting up the coin to hire back Colana and Sue-Rend, I'm afraid the forge's coffers are close to empty again."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"I can only think of two solutions to this problem: one, we seek out a new client with a large-scale commission and a fat purse; or two, I start paying Eismon less than he's worth."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Let's keep expanding your client list."},{"name":"A1","text":"Eismon probably wouldn't complain..."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Yes, that's probably the best option. Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"No, he wouldn't! I could ask him to get by on half of what he earns now!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"...And then feel terrible for taking advantage of him. I know the man seems to actually enjoy eating worms, but perhaps finding a new client is the best option here."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"If I'm being honest with you, I actually already had a candidate in mind: the Nu Mou of Il Mheg. They were supposedly on friendly terms with the people of Voeburt...while the kingdom yet existed, at least."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"As for brokering deals, treat fairly with them and they will treat fairly with you, it is said. My main concern is the dangers posed by simply entering the domain of the pixies itself."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"What we need is an escort to the bargaining table─someone whom the pixies already know and trust. I don't suppose you know anyone like that, do you...?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"I am known to the Nu Mou."},{"name":"A2","text":"I can converse with the pixies."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Wh-What!? You!? I can't believe the perfect ambassador for the Bellows was under my nose this entire time!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Well then, let's not waste another moment. I'll put my traveling pack together and meet you on the road for Il Mheg!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Il Mheg lies just ahead. The faerie folk might try to scare us off, but my will is iron! Once I've chosen a path, there's no stopping me!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"New and profitable clients, here we come!"},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Did I hear Iola say something about halving my wages? She wasn't being serious...was she?"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Aaargh! There's something touching my face! Get it off! Get it off!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Quickly, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! We have to reach the Nu Mou!"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"I know you... You won the scepter from the elder."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"And this young lady is a friend of yours...?"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"I... Yes! I've come to trade! Your people once served the Kingdom of Voeburt, and I hoped to provide goods on which to spend your stash of Voeburt gold! You...do have gold, don't you?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Ah, you desire an exchange─'tis the Nu Mou way to barter one thing for another. But we will not part with our golden treasures if you have naught we deem equal in worth to the coin."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"&lt;sniff&gt; ...Is that iron I smell? You are workers of metal?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Then mayhap you have something to offer us after all. Since the fall of Voeburt and the scattering of its people, we have been hard-pressed to obtain new censers."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Censers? We can forge censers! Why, the Iron Bellows will craft you the finest censers you've ever seen! I mean, once our artisans decide upon a design..."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Wonderful. I shall come to you upon completion of the first piece."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Right then, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, we should get straight to work. Back to the Mean we go!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Welcome back, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"You know, I've heard stories about the Nu Mou, but that was the first time I'd seen one in the flesh. They were a little more intimidating than the adorable puppy people I'd imagined."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Still, if all goes well, we stand to rake in a stack or two of Voeburtite honors! That should take the pressure off the Bellows' finances for a good long while."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"So let's put together one spectacular censer, shall we?"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"If you find yourself needing more materials, Eismon will provide!"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Only a masterpiece of craftsmanship would be worthy of Voeburt gold. I am curious to see what you can create."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"If I'm to plug the hole I've dug in our finances, then this arrangement with the Nu Mou has to succeed. Bring me the best censer you can possibly craft!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Why, this is so exquisite, I'm almost tempted to keep it for myself! Our client will be pleased indeed."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Now we just wait until Nee Marn arrives to inspect the censer...<br>Fancy a game of cards?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"(-???-)Oho, so this is the Crystarium. So much life and commotion!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Quick! Someone pinch me with a pair of pliers! Either I'm dreaming, or that's a flying, <span class=\"emphasis\">talking</span> pig."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"I promise you, you're fully awake. It is I, Nee Marn, and this porcine fellow is my familiar."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"We Nu Mou are bound strongly to the magicks of Il Mheg, and straying beyond its borders is unnerving to say the least. I hope you don't mind if I inspect the censer by proxy...?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Hm. Hmmm. &lt;snort&gt;<br>The design is unfamiliar, but entrancing."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"And the metal construction should render it quite durable. Yes, those nasty pests are in for a smoky surprise."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Nasty pests!? Are you suffering some manner of invasion?"},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"Our home, Pla Enni, is a humid place, and it attracts swarms of gnats and the like. So many winged nuisances, in fact, that the buzzing is distracting us from our meditations."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"But with a censer like this to fill the air with scented smoke, peace and quiet will soon be ours once more."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"This is a problem we would have taken to the Voeburtites, once upon a time... Now, we have no artisans nearby with whom to trade our shiny coins."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Sooo, you're saying those gold pieces are just piling up in the corner, taking up room? I'm <span class=\"emphasis\">sure</span> my forge can offer you a way to rid yourself of some of that clutter."},{"name":"NEEMARN","text":"&lt;snort&gt; Your concern for our domestic tidiness is touching! Assuming you can provide more exceptional goods such as this one, then we shall be glad to feed your golden hunger. Until we meet again!"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"I think we made a favorable impression with Nee Marn─I seem to amuse them, and your craft sealed the deal."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"With the Nu Mou as our clients, I can run the Iron Bellows the way we used to! No more worrying about wages! Everything back in its rightful place!"},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A3","text":"And that ring you mentioned?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Everything...?"},{"name":"IOLA","text":"Okay, maybe not <span class=\"emphasis\">everything</span>. But I have to keep this place running for my artisans─not waste money on some sentimental trinket..."},{"name":"COLANA","text":"We walked away when things got tough, left her to rebuild the Bellows alone... It's about time we returned the favor."},{"name":"SUEREND","text":"Trite, but true. Mayhap there is something we can do..."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"I'm ready to put the next stage of my revival plan in motion. If this goes well, then any lingering fear that the Bellows will go belly up can finally be put to rest."},{"name":"IOLA","text":"I actually already have the client picked out, but I need to make a few preparations first. I'll share the details with you soon..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The next request will be available from Iola upon reaching level 78 as a blacksmith, armorer, or goldsmith."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"Oh, you'll want to deliver your finished work to Iola, not me."},{"name":"EISMON","text":"If you happen to run out of materials, I can have a look through our stock. We have some spare bits and pieces lying around..."}],"reward":{"gil":1772,"items":[{"num":250,"id":8},{"num":250,"id":9}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":75,"id":151}],"quests":[68763]},"next":[68765]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1027233","obj":{"i":1027233,"n":"Iola","l":2951,"q":3}},{"type":"item","id":"27236","obj":{"i":27236,"n":"Intricate Censer Materials","l":406,"c":20970,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"27237","obj":{"i":27237,"n":"Intricate Censer","l":406,"c":26579,"t":63}},{"type":"quest","id":"68763","obj":{"i":68763,"n":"Iola, Forgemaster","g":167,"l":"The Crystarium","s":110,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68765","obj":{"i":68765,"n":"The Iron Bellows","g":167,"l":"The Crystarium","s":130}}]}
