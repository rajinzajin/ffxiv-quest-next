In order to facilitate your journey, she bestows upon you an airship pass, which will allow you to travel by air between the three allied nations. Before making your way to the airship landing, be sure to quiz Baderon as to what awaits beyond the Strait of Merlthor.","In addition to Limsa Lominsa, the Eorzean Alliance encompasses the city–states of Gridania and Ul'dah. Once you have made your final preparations for the journey, take the Crow's Lift to the airship landing and speak with L'nophlo at the entrance lobby.","You are now ready to embark upon the first leg of your journey, which will take you to Gridania.

Make your way to Nophica's Altar within Old Gridania, and present Merlwyb's missive to the silent conjurer to gain admission.","The Elder Seedseer is receptive to the proposal detailed in Merlwyb's missive. It appears the Garlean Empire remains a grave threat to Eorzea, with the XIVth Imperial Legion, led by Legatus Gaius van Baelsar, deeply entrenched in the border regions. Your business in Gridania successfully concluded, make your way to the airship landing and speak with Lionnellais.","You are now ready to embark upon the second leg of your journey, which will take you to Ul'dah.

Present Merlwyb's missive to Bartholomew on the Hustings Strip to gain admission.","Having now passed on Merlwyb's message to the leaders of both Gridania and Ul'dah, you have discharged your duty as the Admiral's envoy, and learned of the various threats facing Eorzea in the process. Given the immensity of the forces at work, you are moved to wonder what meaningful contribution a lone adventurer might make to the realm's preservation. Perhaps the answer will be revealed to you in the days to come."],"objectives":["Speak with Baderon.","Speak with L'nophlo at the airship landing.","Board the airship.","Speak with the serpent honor guard.","Present Merlwyb's missive to the silent conjurer at Nophica's Altar.","Speak with Lionnellais at the airship landing.","Board the airship.","Speak with the flame honor guard.","Present Merlwyb's missive to Bartholomew on the Hustings Strip."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MERLWYB","text":"The duty I have in mind for you requires some explanation.
