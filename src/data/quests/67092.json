While it sounds like nothing more than a fanciful fabrication, he explains his tale comes straight from the Wood Wailers who dared to enter. As he heard it, the portal leads to a labyrinth that changes its design every time scouts enter its long-abandoned halls. Though the potential for spoils intrigues him, he finds the risk is not worth the reward. If you should be bold enough to enter, however, he bids you speak with the Wood Wailers at the mouth of Issom-Har to learn more.","You find a dutiful Wood Wailer keeping watch over the entrance to Issom-Har. He directs you to Quarrymill, where their reconnaissance team is recruiting adventurers willing to brave the depths of the ruins.","The head of the Wood Wailers' reconnaissance team explains to you their dire situation. Though they have had little success in navigating the ruins, a Padjali mage in their company has devised weaponry to aid those willing to enter. With a plan of action and equipment in hand, the Wood Wailers bid you venture into the depths of the ruins to discover what secrets lie within."],"objectives":["Speak with the Wood Wailer expeditionary at Issom-Har in the South Shroud.","Speak with the Wood Wailer expeditionary captain at Quarrymill."],"dialogue":[{"name":"NOJIROMARUJIRO","text":"As I live and breathe! You're that adventurer everyone's been talking about, aren't you!? I take it you've heard about that nasty business down near Issom–Har."},{"name":"NOJIROMARUJIRO","text":"If you're poking around looking for work, you must be an adventurer too, am I right? You won't find much here, I'm afraid. Seems the only thing people talk about these days is that nasty bit of business down near Issom–Har."},{"name":"NOJIROMARUJIRO","text":"Surely you've heard the stories. Of a strange portal suddenly appearing in the ruins down there."},{"name":"NOJIROMARUJIRO","text":"Hey, don't give me that look. I'm only telling you what I overheard from the Wailers. They say on the other end of it is some sort of labyrinth. The thing is, every time they go down there to map the place out, nothing is the same. A mystery if I've ever heard one."},{"name":"NOJIROMARUJIRO","text":"Frankly, I'm more than happy to let it <span class=\"emphasis\">stay</span> a mystery. Strange apparitions, booby-trapped corridors─going down there is nothing short of suicide."},{"name":"NOJIROMARUJIRO","text":"Still, the prospect of treasure is awful tempting... Ahem. Don't take my word for it, though. Head down to Issom–Har and you can hear it straight from the chocobo's mouth."},{"name":"NOJIROMARUJIRO","text":"If you're planning to go, I'm afraid you're on your own, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">mister</span></span>. What good is treasure if I never make it out of there to enjoy it?"},{"name":"ERAL","text":"I bid you safe travels, friend. If you should make it back in one piece, mayhaps Nojiro and I will accompany you on your next foray into the ruins."},{"name":"IRIELLE","text":"Our excavation of the ruins has been at a standstill ever since that accursed gateway appeared. Not long after, the Wood Wailers swooped in, who then proceeded to force us out. I do not care how dangerous they say it is─our work must continue!"},{"name":"ROLANDAIX","text":"We were removed from the ruins with barely any explanation. My life's work is down there, and they are likely stamping it into the dirt even as we speak! What in the seven hells is going on?  "},{"name":"WOODWAILER00000","text":"I'm sorry, but I must insist that you─ Oh, an adventurer, and a rather seasoned-looking one besides. On the off chance you're not simply here to gawp, perhaps you can lend us a hand?"},{"name":"WOODWAILER00000","text":"You see, despite the fervent protestations of those Duskwights over there, we cannot permit civilians within the ruins at this time."},{"name":"WOODWAILER01556","text":"Capable men and women like you, on the other hand, are more than welcome! That is, if you've got the stones for it."},{"name":"WOODWAILER01556","text":"Pray seek out the others stationed at Quarrymill. They can apprise you of the details."},{"name":"WOODWAILER01556","text":"If you've a mind to poke around in the ruins, you'd best speak with the others in Quarrymill first.

I take it you have come to learn more of the recent happenings at Issom–Har."},{"name":"WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556","text":"The site is of interest owing to the Gelmorran ruins─Gelmorra being an underground city which predates Gridania, in case you were unaware."},{"name":"WOODWAILER00000","text":"Anyroad, a few days past, we received reports from several anthropogeographers that a magical gateway of some sort had appeared in the ruins, and that all manner of creatures were coming and going through it."},{"name":"WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556","text":"My men and I were among the first to examine it, and well... It's hard to explain. We crossed the threshold into a set of corridors we'd never seen before, and then suddenly, each and every one of us was filled with an inexplicable sense of dread. It was all I could do to take even a single step."},{"name":"WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556","text":"According to E–Una–Kotor, who accompanied us, the ruins are warded with powerful magicks that sap the spirits─and aether─of all who enter, rendering them easy prey for the creatures within."},{"name":"WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556","text":"Thankfully, he managed to devise a solution: aetherpool arms and armor, which safeguard and channel the wielder's energies, that they might withstand the ruin's magicks."},{"name":"WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556","text":"Unfortunately, it does little to prevent us from losing our way. Though it beggars belief, every time we have dared to venture into the ruins, we have found the path to be changed. We suspect this too may be the work of an unfathomably powerful mage..."},{"name":"WOODWAILERCAPTAIN01556","text":"Needless to say, something strange is afoot, and traditional tactics are not like to suffice.
