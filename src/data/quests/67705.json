Sonu Vanu has called a meeting at Ok' Zundu to discuss this new threat. Follow the others to Ok' Zundu and speak with Sonu Vanu on your arrival.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Upon your arrival to Ok' Zundu the Vanu Vanu begin discussing the Vundu's demands. Sonu Vanu is willing to fight, but it seems his people are hesitant to join a battle they have little chance of winning. After some terse words and arguments, Linu Vali suggests that if the two tribes cannot win by virtue of numbers, then they should rob the Vundu of their will to fight with the sundrop dance. The plan is met with some agreement, but the Zundu's fighting spirit is not what it once was. They need a mighty warrior to show them the sundrop dance and rekindle the flames of fury in their heart. All present agree that you, as the one who defeated Bismarck, should be the one to motivate the Zundu with the sundrop dance. Linu Vali will teach you the steps, but first you must perform the initiation ceremony. Meet Linu Vali at the entrance to Ok' Zundu to begin the ceremony.","You find Linu Vali standing in front of a massive stone sculpture wrought in the shape of a birdlike creature. She explains that the statue depicts the mother of all Vanu, and that in order to earn the right to the sundrop dance, you must dance atop two such statues, baring your soul to their judgment. Ascend the statue and put your most energetic /dance on display. ","Through your dance, you lay bare your spirit to the mother of all Vanu. Return to Linu Vali to tell her of your stirring performance.","Your dance impresses Linu Vali, and she guides you to the second ancestral statue. Follow Linu Vali to Vundu Ok' Bendu.","You find Linu Vali standing in front of yet another enormous Vanu Vanu sculpture, this time depicting the father of all Vanu. Once again, /dance on the statue with all the passion your spirit can muster.","The father of all Vanu has seen what your soul looks like. Return to Linu Vali to see what the final step of this ritual is.","Your trial is complete, and Linu Vali can now teach you the dance of her people. Follow her to Ok' Zundu to begin your first lesson.","Upon your arrival at Ok' Zundu, Linu Vali finally teaches you the sundrop dance. As you dance the steps, you can feel generations of Vanu ancestors give weight and power to your movements. After you master the dance, you perform it for the flagging Ok' Zundu citizens. They are so moved by your dance that they immediately agree to join the Gundu in their fight against the Vundu. Both tribes will practice their sundrop dance until the day of the decisive battle. When the time comes, be ready to lend the vigor of your dance as well."],"objectives":["Speak with Sonu Vanu at Ok' Zundu.","Rendezvous with Linu Vali at the entrance to Ok' Zundu.","/dance atop the ancestral statue.","Report to Linu Vali.","Rendezvous with Linu Vali in front of Vundu Ok' Bendu.","/dance atop the ancestral statue.","Report to Linu Vali.","Speak with Linu Vali at Ok' Zundu."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LINUVALI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, black winds bring terrible news!
