Mogloo bids you speak with Mogkul, his second-in-command, at Asah for further details of your duty.","On the road to Asah, you come across Mogkul being beset upon by a dragon, and quickly dispatch it, saving the tired moogle. Speak with him to ensure that he is hale and whole.","Although Mogkul managed to fell two of the beasts when they attacked, it seems a third one was just too much for him to bear. He thanks you for your assistance, and bids you return to Asah with him to speak further of Zenith's defense.","Mogkul explains that the moogles in the Churning Mists have a sacred agreement with the great wyrm Hraesvelgr to keep up the maintenance of the landlords' many structures dotting the land. However, the increasing rashness of Nidhogg's brood has made it even more difficult to do their duty, and Mogkul is overjoyed when you agree to help them. Begin your valiant defense of Zenith with the other moogles at your side."],"objectives":["Search for Mogkul.","Speak with Mogkul."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MOGLOO","text":"Ah, adventurer, word of your valorous deeds has spread far and wide.
