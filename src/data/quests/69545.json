Eager to be reunited with your mutual friend, he sets off for the Rising Stones at a brisk pace, leaving you and Alisaie to follow in his wake.","You get back to the Rising Stones to find Krile also returned, and she briefs you on all that transpired at the recent Alliance council. With the Empire still at war with itself, the Alliance has turned its attention to the primal problem once more. Working with friendly factions among the beast tribes, they hope to explore new avenues for peace, a development which only adds to your comrades' determination to find a cure for tempering. On that note, the impromptu meeting concludes, and Tataru suggests you wait for Cid in Dawn's Respite.","G'raha Tia positively beams with delight as Cid enters the chamber, and the pair enjoy a brief but joyous reunion. Soon after, thoughts turn to the matter of the locked report and Cid sets to work. Using the calculating power of a magitek terminal, he succeeds in identifying the late Owen's password, and you watch intently as the Allagan technologist appears in holographic form and explains the mechanism by which eikons make thralls of men. It is duly confirmed that, like those corrupted by Light, the souls of the tempered are subject to stagnation. <span class=\"emphasis\">Unlike</span> with the victims of the sin eaters, however, you learn that one cannot reanimate a tempered soul without also intensifying the victim's fanatical faith. When you articulate this dilemma, G'raha Tia is inspired to theorize that an adapted version of memory transference might make it possible to perform targeted reanimation, and it is decided that you will rely once more on magitek terminals─this time to formulate a magick.","While Cid and G'raha Tia configure the terminals, you and the others are tasked with procuring supplies. Ironworks promissory note in hand, you set out for the Skysteel Manufactory in Ishgard to obtain the necessary ceruleum.","At the Skysteel Manufactory, you present the promissory note to Fromelaut, who informs you that an engineer at the airship landing will assist you with the ceruleum.","As you converse with the engineer, who should emerge from the landing but Ser Aymeric. Upon learning of your quest to cure tempering, he pledges Ishgard's full support, and sees you off aboard an airship laden with all the ceruleum you require and more.<br><br>Some while later, you enter the workshop at Revenant's Toll to find preparations well underway, the terminals successfully configured with the assistance of the ever-capable-if-not-available Nero. After confirming that all is ready, Cid gives the order to begin. While the terminals conduct their endless simulations, you decide to take a moment's rest...and awaken to a scene of chaos as the devices threaten to overload. Mere moments before they break down, the magick is revealed to G'raha Tia, who heaves a sigh of relief before turning to everyone with a smile. At long last, the world has a cure for tempering."],"objectives":["Speak with G'raha Tia at the Rising Stones.","Wait for Cid in Dawn's Respite.","Speak with Cid.","Show the Ironworks promissory note to Fromelaut at the Skysteel Manufactory.","Hand the Ironworks promissory note to the Skysteel engineer."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Fine. I'll let Cid try his hand first. But if that doesn't work, we're doing it my way."},{"name":"DATASYSTEM","text":"&lt;blip&gt; Threat detected..."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I should probably mention that I have yet to meet Cid since waking up. Rammbroes did send word to the Ironworks, but it appears our friend has been afield on urgent business."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Nevertheless, I assure you my proposal to seek his help is no pretext, however much I might look forward to seeing him again. Him and everyone. But come, let us be on our way."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Hehehe! Look at him, all but running... How sweet."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Still, it wouldn't do to keep him waiting. Shall we?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Krile's back too. I wonder what was decided at the council..."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"I take it you have news to share. So do I."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"I'm pleased to see your mission was a success─and in no small part due to the <span class=\"emphasis\">Bonanza</span>!"},{"name":"DATASYSTEM","text":"&lt;blip&gt; Large lowborn presence detected."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Wonderful news, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Tataru contacted Cid on our behalf, and he is on his way here even as we speak!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"While we wait, I should like very much to hear what transpired at the Alliance council. Would you be so kind, Krile?"},{"name":"KRILE","text":"As you know, the meeting was convened to discuss how best to respond to recent events in Garlemald."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"According to intelligence from our Doman allies, the war of succession rages on, and the Empire remains without a leader."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Amidst the chaos, the imperial legions in the provinces have begun to move independently of the motherland."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Of greatest concern to us is the IIIrd, a legion aligned with Lord Nerva. It appears they have received substantial financial backing from House Brutus."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Brutus... Aren't they the ones who took in Yotsuyu and Asahi? This bodes well..."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Zenos's movements, meanwhile, remain shrouded in mystery. We're hoping that Thancred and Urianger will be able to shed some light on his activities when they return."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Until such time as they do, the Allied leaders feel it would be unwise to interfere in the conflict. And so, thanks in part to the imperial withdrawal from Ghimlyt, they have decided to turn their attention to the primal problem once more."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Working with friendly factions among the beast tribes, they hope to reopen dialogue and explore new avenues for peace."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Given the timing, I suspect they wish to put their respective houses in order ahead of a decisive clash with the Empire."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Whatever their intent, this is not a problem easily solved. The Lominsans, in particular, struggle in their efforts, and Alphinaud and Y'shtola have been called upon to aid them."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"So long as we are dealing with the tempered, I'm afraid no amount of dialogue will avail us."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But if we can develop a treatment for tempering, then anything is possible!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Which is why we must succeed."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"And on that cheery note, why not make yourselves comfortable in Dawn's Respite? I'll show Cid in as soon as he arrives!"},{"name":"KRILE","text":"I understand you took a little trip to Azys Lla. Raha made himself useful, I trust?"},{"name":"TATARU","text":"We've made the Respite cozier than ever. You're going to love it!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Cid, at long last..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"As important as Ga Bu is to me, I know only too well how much more is at stake here. A cure could change the whole world."},{"name":"DATASYSTEM","text":"&lt;blip&gt; &lt;bloop&gt; Warning: His Highness is exhibiting elevated blood pressure."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Cid!"},{"name":"CID","text":"Forgive us for not coming to see you sooner, my friend. As you may have heard, we've had our hands full."},{"name":"CID","text":"In our defense, you <span class=\"emphasis\">are</span> up rather early. I was under the impression you'd be slumbering awhile longer."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Oh, I would have been─had you not fulfilled your promise."},{"name":"CID","text":"Hah! I still struggle with that idea. From where I stand, the secrets of traversing time and space seem exactly as unfathomable as they ever did."},{"name":"CID","text":"But if an alternate version of myself has already laid them bare, I daresay that frees me up to concentrate on other endeavors. Speaking of which, you wanted my help with something. What is it?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Well, well...a treatment for tempering. And for the next step, you need to find the password to this Allagan's report..."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Just so. With nary a clue to guide us, we could be here forever and still not guess correctly. And thus we turn to you."},{"name":"CID","text":"Well, I'd love to say that we could help you...so I will. Once suitably configured, a magitek terminal should make short work of identifying the password."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I knew I could rely on you. Now, anticipating that it might be of use, I took the liberty of borrowing a tomestone from Rammbroes. It contains an Allagan dictionary."},{"name":"CID","text":"Good thinking. I'll transfer the information to a terminal and set it to work right away."},{"name":"CID","text":"Ah, looks like it's finished. Let's see..."},{"name":"CID","text":"“Freedom.” The password is “freedom.”"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Hah. Short and simple, just as I said. Would you care to do the honors, Your Highness?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"I would, milady!"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Node, open the report entitled “Eikonic Corruption ─ An Overview,” password: freedom!"},{"name":"DATASYSTEM","text":"Password accepted. &lt;bloop&gt; Opening report..."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"This report seeks to provide an overview of the mechanism by which eikons corrupt and bind men to their will."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"The phenomenon we call “corruption” refers to the alteration of the aether of the soul."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"Said aether ordinarily exists in equilibrium; no one element being more prominent than another."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"But when a subject is exposed to the aether of an eikon, this changes, their soul taking on the properties of the entity in question."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"By way of an example, exposure to the aether of the Fiend, Sephirot, would cause a subject's aether to become aligned with the element of earth."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"As a consequence, the subject would attain heightened affinity with earth-aspected magicks, as well as preternatural levels of endurance. Repeated exposure would further enhance these traits, ultimately altering the subject's very flesh."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"The changes undergone by the subject are not solely attributable to elemental alignment, however. Further testing has determined that the subject's soul becomes umbrally charged, or stagnant during the process."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"This stagnation of the soul has the effect of diluting the sense of self, rendering the subject vulnerable to the will of the eikon, the thoughts of whom come to consume their entire existence."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"In this manner do the corrupted become worshipers of the eikon, their prayers serving to further empower the entity."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"Having discerned the mechanism of eikonic corruption, my colleagues and I set out to develop a material capable of shielding one from its effects. An endeavor in which we were successful, albeit it at great cost..."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"In the course of testing, many of my assistants─good men and women all─fell victim to corruption. And in accordance with protocol, they were summarily put to death."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"I subsequently submitted a proposal to investigate potential cures for corruption, but it was rejected─deemed “nonessential” by Lord Amon."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"Though I knew it would be fruitless, I protested the decision. And for my impertinence, I have been stripped of rank and title, and will shortly be expelled from this facility."},{"name":"OWEN","text":"In all likelihood, this report will be expunged from the archives. Nonetheless, I record it in the hope that one day, someone will undertake to do that which I could not, and find a cure for the victims of eikonic corruption. End recording."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"So not even the Allagans were able to find a cure. Or rather, were not given the chance to do so. One cannot help but wonder what motivated Lord Amon's decision."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"More importantly, this confirms that stagnation of the soul is indeed the problem─and Angelo can remedy that."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"True. Yet were we simply to reanimate a tempered soul, I fear it would do naught to diminish the individual's fanatical faith. Indeed, it may well intensify it."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"No, we would somehow need to suppress the primal's hold over the subject at the same time, or risk them ever remaining its thrall."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"If we could only make them remember who they were..."},{"name":"A1","text":"So there's no point in reviving their souls unless we can also restore their sense of self?"},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"But of course─memory transference! The process has the effect of compartmentalizing memories─separating them into manageable bundles, if you will."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"By adapting the technique, it may be possible to achieve <span class=\"emphasis\">selective</span> reanimation. That is, limit the effects to only those memories that existed prior to tempering."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Through thus restoring the sense of self, we could theoretically drown out the incitements of false faith which had come to dominate the individual's thoughts."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I see... The theory seems sound. And our experience treating the Light-corrupted <span class=\"emphasis\">would</span> help us to identify suitable memories for reanimation."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"But are you confident you can adapt memory transference as required? I seem to recall your attempts to do so while trying to bring us home culminated in literal bloodletting."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"They did, you are right. Despite my best efforts, I could not recreate the mechanism. And I concede that the rather clumsy compromise I reached would not provide the basis for a cure."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Then perhaps it's better that we consider another approach."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Your doubts are understandable, but this time I believe we have reason to be confident."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"You see, nodes such as this were built with the ability to simulate magicks."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Which leads me to believe that it may be capable of performing simulations of the transference technique. If so, we would be able to conduct years' worth of tests within the space of a few days."},{"name":"CID","text":"Hm. In theory, it would be no different from how we identified the password."},{"name":"CID","text":"But it'll take more calculating power. A lot more. I honestly couldn't say whether our equipment would be up to the task."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Tell me, Cid. Why do you suppose Owen locked his report behind a password?"},{"name":"CID","text":"To keep it from prying eyes, of course. Why else?"},{"name":"CID","text":"...Wait. A password that could be guessed by anyone with leisure and a dictionary wouldn't keep it from a person minded to look."},{"name":"CID","text":"No, he <span class=\"emphasis\">wanted</span> his report to be seen...by those who strive for freedom."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"Not unlike the members of a certain distinguished engineering collective. I believe their motto was “Freedom through Technology,” or some such."},{"name":"CID","text":"You two─round up as many magitek terminals as you can find and bring them to the workshop."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"Right away, Chief!"},{"name":"CID","text":"Things are about to get very busy. Lucky we have you to help, eh?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"We're getting there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. One step at a time."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"As with our first foray into the Labyrinth of the Ancients, we seek to venture into the unknown. And in order to succeed, we require not only knowledge and preparation, but daring besides. Just like old times."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Suffice it to say, I shall be of whatever help I can."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Hmmm, all those magitek terminals won't come cheap... Ack, shut up, Tataru. Some things you shouldn't put a price on."},{"name":"DATASYSTEM","text":"..."},{"name":"CID","text":"Right, while G'raha Tia and I configure the terminals, I want the rest of you to procure supplies."},{"name":"CID","text":"Namely, ceruleum to fuel the terminals and ice shards to keep them cool. The more we have of both, the better."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"Leave the ice shards to me. I'll round up some adventurers and go on a gathering spree."},{"name":"CID","text":"In that case, I'll trust <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and Alisaie with the ceruleum. Here's a promissory note for each of you."},{"name":"CID","text":"Take them to the Skysteel Manufactory in Ishgard and the Ceruleum Processing Plant in Thanalan. The people there will give you what we need."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Yours is a well-known face in the Holy See, I believe? If it's all the same to you, I'll head to Thanalan."},{"name":"CID","text":"If Alisaie's bound for the Ceruleum Processing Plant, you'll want to take yourself to the Skysteel Manufactory. Off you go, now."},{"name":"GRAHATIA","text":"We shall see to it the terminals are ready by the time you return."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"We're about to set out for the ice shards.
