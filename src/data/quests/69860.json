I've a problem of a...marital nature, shall we say. You see, my husband was looking rather green around the gills when he left for work this morning."},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"As much as I would like to check on him myself, I'm afraid my research is of such import I can't leave it unattended for any amount of time."},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"Which is why I must ask you to look in on him in my stead. You're like to find my darling slaving away in Kokkol's Forge, if he hasn't been carted off to the infirmary yet, that is."},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"He's a rather handsome man, whose garish red glasses make him hard to miss. Should you notice that he's under the weather, I ask that you provide him with this philter, which will hopefully revitalize him."},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"I'm sorry to lay such a burden on you, but I've no one else to whom I can entrust this. Please hurry, as I fear he'll keel over before long."},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"My poor bespectacled fool of a husband... Why would he even so much as think to work when he's so clearly out of sorts. I only hope the philter I made will be enough to cure him of what ails him."},{"name":"RESEARCHERB04324","text":"Oh dear... Perhaps going into work...was not...the best decision...after all..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The man is in very poor health indeed and likely requires the medicine you were provided."},{"name":"RESEARCHERB04324","text":"Oh my, that's much better! Thank you kindly, stranger. A weakness came over me quite suddenly. No doubt caused by a thinning of the blood or some such."},{"name":"RESEARCHERB04324","text":"That medicine is one of my wife's creations, is it not? I would know her alchemy anywhere. That must mean she enlisted your help to see it brought to me, then, yes?"},{"name":"RESEARCHERB04324","text":"I thought as much. So little gets past my better half, though I did my best to hide my fatigue."},{"name":"RESEARCHERB04324","text":"I myself am a researcher in Thaumazein. Ah, that interests you, does it? Well then, you will get a kick out of this. We are currently developing a new sort of alloy which, at the molecular level, contains psychosensitive materials such as dark matter."},{"name":"RESEARCHERB04324","text":"The wonders we could work with such a marvelous metal... Imagine how much tighter controls could become were we to fit it into a cockpit? But I'm getting ahead of myself. At any rate, our work is reaching its crescendo, and I wouldn't dare miss even so much as a day of it."},{"name":"RESEARCHERB04324","text":"Would you be so kind as to tell my wife that there's no cause for concern? All she need know is that her philter worked wonders."},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"You spoke with my husband, then, did you? How was he? Was he as unwell as I had feared?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"He was well, though I gave him the philter just in case."},{"name":"A1","text":"He was in terrible health, as you suspected."},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"Indeed... Well, let me just say that lying is <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> your forte. It's plain as day that he put those words in your mouth. He must be in a dreadful state if he's decided to spin some story. I'm right, aren't I?"},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"I just knew it. What was that man thinking? To fight through such illness, all so he can─what?─go to work? Honestly!"},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"It's all well and good to wholly commit oneself to one's profession, but to do so at the expense of one's health? That's beyond the pale. He'll be getting an earful from me, that much I can assure you."},{"name":"RESEARCHERA04324","text":"I shudder to think what would have become of my husband had you not stepped in when you did. Though it's a trifle compared to what you deserve, I offer you this, to thank you for your help."}],"reward":{"gil":815},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69982]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1041319","obj":{"i":1041319,"n":"Fretting Researcher","l":3708,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69982","obj":{"i":69982,"n":"Hither and Yarns","g":11,"l":"Labyrinthos","s":600}}]}
