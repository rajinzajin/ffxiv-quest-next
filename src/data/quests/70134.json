We must be on our guard."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Though so slow as to be nearly imperceptible, Zero's chest rises and falls in a steady rhythm..."},{"name":"VARSHAHN","text":"How long do you suppose she will remain this way?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I haven't the faintest inkling, nor can I say whether the aether we can afford to share will be enough to awaken her."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"'Twould be best to take her back with us to the Source. There, she would be guaranteed all she requires."},{"name":"VARSHAHN","text":"Zero cannot give her consent, but it seems we have no choice. The alternative would be to leave her here, defenseless."},{"name":"VARSHAHN","text":"Should she later desire it, we can bring her home."},{"name":"VARSHAHN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, might I ask you to hold on to Barbariccia's memoria?

With luck, we might learn something of Golbez."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Worry not, we will keep an eye on Zero. Go and meet this newcomer."},{"name":"ESTINIEN","text":"When the leader falls, the minions pledge themselves to the enemy.

No better way to guard oneself than keeping one's location secret."},{"name":"VARSHAHN","text":"How does Golbez communicate with his minions afield?"},{"name":"VOIDSENT04598","text":"He has these...scepters?
