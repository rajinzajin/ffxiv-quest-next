Excellent. Make offerings of these Nymeia lilies at some of the simpler graves in the lichyard.

And remember, friend: mind your surroundings and pay the proper respect with each bundle of lilies... You're all they have."},{"name":"AIRELL","text":"Once more, you have my thanks. No doubt the souls of the departed can take some small comfort in the care you have shown their graves."},{"name":"AIRELL","text":"In days gone by, the lichyard was a small, humble plot. But that all changed after the Calamity. The dead grew in number, and so the yard grew with them."},{"name":"AIRELL","text":"It is still simple, despite its size. Of course, it's that selfsame simplicity that keeps it from becoming more of a priority for the Order. We can ill afford to assign adequate numbers to its keeping, just as we cannot charge the poor to bury or be buried."},{"name":"AIRELL","text":"Yet that does not stop the many who come calling to see their dead put to rest here. Those few of us who tend the yard haven't the time to see to the offerings our piety demands."},{"name":"AIRELL","text":"The simple graves you visited belong to those who died alone.
