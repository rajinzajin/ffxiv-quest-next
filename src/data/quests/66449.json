Speak with Emanuel and collect a bottle of Daniffen's Joy.","Emanuel entrusts you with a rare liquor of Ser Aurelle's choosing. Resist the fleeting urge to down the entire bottle and deliver it to Medguistl, a member of Haurchefant's household.","Medguistl takes delivery of the bottle, and, astute as always, guesses from whom it actually issues. His lordship is bound to be pleased in any case, for his life has had little joy lately."],"objectives":["Speak with Emanuel.","Deliver the bottle of Daniffen's Joy to Medguistl."],"dialogue":[{"name":"AURELLE","text":"A moment, if you will.

Yet what was thin must eventually grow fat again."},{"name":"AURELLE","text":"I would thank Lord Haurchefant as well, but I should not like to be seen as currying favor either for myself or for my house.
