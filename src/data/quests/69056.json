I saw you fight! You were so strong, so confident, but so careful not to injure any of the civilians..."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"Maybe you'd be interested in helping out with what I'm planning. I'm a fairly decent cook, actually─I sometimes feel as if that's the <span class=\"emphasis\">only</span> thing I'm good at─and I thought it might bring people comfort to know that they could come here and get a decent meal."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"The trouble is, there are too many options as to what I could prepare, and I'm not much for making decisions. I would simply ask around, but civilians tend to get a bit nervous when a member of the army starts asking questions, and I don't want to cause anyone <span class=\"emphasis\">more</span> distress."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"That being the case─would you mind asking a few people what sort of dishes might lift their spirits? I don't need the recipes, just ideas."},{"name":"ROITATCHA","text":"Food that would lift my spirits? Hmm... Voeburt muffins, maybe? My mother often used to make them."},{"name":"CHADDRIC","text":"Free meals? Yes, that would certainly improve the mood around here. As for what people would enjoy─perhaps a dish that they've never had before? Though I'm not terribly familiar with anything other than Voeburtite cuisine, myself."},{"name":"LEAMOSHEI","text":"How about Kholusian stew? It was a popular dish before the Flood, apparently. All I really know is that it's meant to incorporate a variety of seafood, but I've always wanted to try it─seems a shame that I've never had the traditional food of my homeland."},{"name":"ROITATCHA","text":"The smell of baking muffins is absolutely divine, I assure you!"},{"name":"CHADDRIC","text":"Perhaps someone who wasn't born locally might have more ideas..."},{"name":"LEAMOSHEI","text":"I don't know about you, but reviving the popularity of Kholusian stew and reclaiming our heritage would certainly raise <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> spirits!"},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"Welcome back! Were people able to suggest anything for me to cook?"},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"Oh, you wrote them down! Thank you! Let me see..."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"Ah, Voeburt muffins and Kholusian stew! I've made those for my patrons before. I'll need fresh seafood from Stilltide, but that shouldn't be an issue."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"As for a dish that people in Eulmore haven't had before─what do you think? Have you come upon anything in your travels outside the city that people might enjoy?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Nothing is so comforting as one of the Mol's buuz on a chill evening."},{"name":"A2","text":"Perhaps a relaxing cup of herbal tea to pair with the meal?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Basilisk stew has been known to increase morale."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"Dough with seafood <span class=\"emphasis\">inside</span> of it? That does sound intriguing. Salty shellfish and tender stewed catfish, together in a hearty bun... Yes, I can picture it."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"Yes, that does sound pleasant. We can't focus solely on the food, after all. I haven't the slightest idea what an “Ishgard” is, but I'd certainly be willing to try brewing tea with lily bulbs."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"A sergeant who offered homemade stew to his troops, warming their hearts and lifting their spirits? Oh, I love a dish with a story to tell! "},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"I'll prepare each of these with the care they deserve, and hopefully my fellow Eulmorans will find some solace in sharing a warm meal."},{"name":"SOLDIER03520","text":"I'm off to fetch ingredients, but before I go─here's a little something that I prepared for you, as thanks. I hope it suits your tastes!"}],"reward":{"gil":606,"items":[{"num":2,"id":27879}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}],"quests":[69168]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1030465","obj":{"i":1030465,"n":"Eulmoran Soldier","l":2952,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"27879","obj":{"i":27879,"n":"Ovim Cordon Bleu","l":430,"c":24363,"t":46}},{"type":"quest","id":"69168","obj":{"i":69168,"n":"Paradise Fallen","g":8,"l":"Eulmore","s":840}}]}
