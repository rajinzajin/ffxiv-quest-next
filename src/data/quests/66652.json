Sisipu directs you to speak with the representative in person, who can enlighten you on the nature of the Consortium's request.","In an effort to satisfy the needs of wealthy Ul'dahns, the Consortium seeks five raincallers, which are said to possess certain desirable properties. Raincallers can be fished out of Gridania's Jadeite Flood with stem borers, but only when rain falls, hence their name. Procure the fish and deliver them to Sybell.","Sybell appears elated at receiving her raincallers, and at the prospect of seeing you again in future.<br><br>※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu upon reaching level 45."],"objectives":["Speak with Sybell.","Deliver raincallers to Sybell."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Just the fisher I was hoping to see! Uncanny timing, as always."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"The celebrity you've achieved has resulted in more obscure requests than I know what to do with! Your dunefishing escapades in particular have raised eyebrows."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"The truly eccentric requests I've seen fit to turn away, but who can say “no” to the Brugaire Consortium?"},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"I, for one, cannot, but perhaps you'll have something else to say when you speak with Sybell. She's waiting for you outside the guild."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I take it? The legends said you were <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">svelte</span><span class=\"alternative\">rugged</span></span>, but failed to mention how <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">voluptuous</span><span class=\"alternative\">delectable</span></span> you are, as well. I have no doubt that our time together will be advantageous to us both."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"To business, then. I want you to bring me raincallers from Gridania's Jadeite Flood. However, there's a catch to this catch."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"The raincallers spend most of their time lying dormant on the bed of the water, active only when the rains come."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Keep an eye to the skies─you'll need the fish to be aroused, so that they'll bite at the bait. Stem borers are most effective, or so I am told."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"As to why we want them, well... The fish are prized by wealthy Ul'dahns for possessing certain...properties."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"And it is the custom of the Brugaire Consortium to fulfill unconventional needs and desires."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Five raincallers are all we require to satisfy these aristocrats' needs."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Bring us five raincallers from Gridania's Jadeite Flood. We <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> make it worth your while."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"I knew you were the right <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">lad</span></span> for the job! Who else could deliver such rare and virile specimens? "},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"These will suit the Ul'dahns' purposes quite well."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"The elder males have been led to believe that ingesting the raincallers will endow them with...let us say “vigor.” No one knows whether it is true, and I don't personally care to find out."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"I only know that rich men will stop at nothing to recapture their former glory, and so these fish should fetch a fair price at market."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Speaking of “fetching,” I'm quite impressed with your handiwork, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. The Consortium will be pleased."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Of course, you've pleased more than just the Consortium.
