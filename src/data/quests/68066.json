Garlean engineering never ceases to impress."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Now that we have taken control of Velodyna, there's nothing stopping us from marching east towards the Peaks."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"If you're looking for Arenvald, I think he's with Pipin, searching the castellum for any remaining soldiers."},{"name":"RESISTANCEGATEGUARD","text":"Velodyna belongs to the Alliance and the Resistance now. You may be assured that the imperials will never hold it again!"},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"I know you're not one for waiting, but if you'll bear with us─"},{"name":"RESISTANCEGATEGUARD","text":"Commander Kemp! Marshal Tarupin reports that their sweep of the castellum's interior has been completed!"},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"So it's finally over, eh? Pray extend to him my deepest thanks."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It's official, then. Castellum Velodyna is well and truly ours. Mayhap this calls for─ Wait, where is M'naago?"},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"She took her bird and flew off towards the Peering Stones─the village of the M tribe, where she was born."},{"name":"CONRAD","text":"I doubt that the imperials who fled Velodyna had a mind to give them trouble on their way back east, but she was nevertheless worried, so I gave her leave to go and see that her people were safe."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Though I pray you are right, 'twould be best if M'naago were not alone if she should encounter the enemy."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Agreed!

In that case, mayhap Marshal Tarupin and I should join you."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"We spied a suspicious pair earlier─a Hyur and a Lalafell, by the looks of them─but they fled when they realized they'd been spotted.

Follow me!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...But of course. Tiring though it may be to come and go from the clifftop, it is easily defended and affords an excellent view of the surrounding area."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"This area is home to dangerous beasts. Naught that we cannot handle, mind, but do not be surprised if something ravenous and slavering comes charging at you out of nowhere."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Well, what do you think?
