The former tells you that the Holy See itself has expressed interest in further surveying the Dravanian hinterlands for mineral wealth, and has asked for Oschon's Raiders by name. However, the knight continues, House Fortemps cannot provide any aid. Haimirich accepts these conditions, but Hatchling does not, and tells his captain so in no uncertain terms after the knight leaves. With a weary sigh, Haimirich enjoins you to come to Idyllshire, whence to begin your survey.","You arrive in Idyllshire to find only Haimirich and Muscles. It seems the company was attacked while you were traveling, leaving two Raiders badly wounded. Hatchling chased after the monsters, and has not been seen since. As you cannot possibly cover the entire area in time, Haimirich asks that you speak with Midnight Dew to see if any of the inhabitants of Idyllshire saw where Hatchling went.","Midnight Dew is willing but unable to help, as Hatchling went missing in an area of the Ruling Quarter untraveled by Idyllshire's inhabitants. However, a wandering goblin trader has been known to pass through there. He can be persuaded to help should you deliver to him three chunks of adamantite ore. This, Midnight Dew informs you, can be mined in Azys Lla─though she herself has never heard of it, and doubts it exists at all.","The goblin trader is overjoyed to have his adamantite ore, and promises to not only tell you and Haimirich where Hatchling has vanished, but guide you there as well. Return to Haimirich with the glad tidings.","Haimirich thanks you for dealing with the goblin trader, and races off to find Hatchling in the Ruling Quarter. Follow him and help find the boy.","You find Hatchling at the bottom of a cliff. Thankfully, the boy is none the worse for the tumble, save a potentially broken leg. Having rescued him, Haimirich finally explains in full why he has been so tough on Hatchling. His own brother, Gevehard, put Oschon's Raiders in a terrible position through his rashness years before. Unable to save both his company and his brother, Haimirich chose the former, and left his brother to die. The decision has haunted him since, though he believes it was the right one. He is glad that he was able to save Hatchling. As you all turn to leave, the captain gives you a heavy sack of loot to give to Midnight Dew for her help. Return to Idyllshire, and deliver it to her in person.","Midnight Dew accepts the heavy sack with thanks, and listens as you tell her what has transpired. However, she is shocked to learn Gevehard's name, for it seems he lived after Haimirich left him to die. Indeed, the younger brother was given succor by the goblins, and valiantly served Idyllshire until dying a hero's death. Return now to Ishgard's Forgotten Knight, and tell Haimirich what really happened to his brother.","Haimirich is understandably amazed to learn his brother survived being left in the wilderness. Though the captain must forever live with the terrible decision he made that day, he is glad to learn that Gevehard became a man in his own right. He informs you that Oschon's Raiders will move on from Ishgard before long to spread their name and fame throughout the realm. But they will always remember you, the miner who did so much good for them.<br><br>※The next miner quest will be available from Adalberta once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"],"objectives":["Speak with Haimirich in Idyllshire.","Speak with Midnight Dew.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mine adamantite ore at Azys Lla</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the chunks of adamantite ore to the goblin trader in Idyllshire</span></span>.","Speak with Haimirich.","Speak with Haimirich in the Ruling Quarter.","Deliver the sellswords' sack to Midnight Dew in Idyllshire.","Report to Haimirich in Ishgard."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Professor, you've earned quite the reputation as the miracle miner.

He wants a word."},{"name":"FORTEMPSKNIGHT02080","text":"Allow me to congratulate you on your latest conquest in the hinterlands. Oschon's Raiders are on the lips of every noble. Moreover, your successes have lent weight to the count's message."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Thank you, m'lord. But did you come down here jus' to pay us compliments, or do you have work?"},{"name":"FORTEMPSKNIGHT02080","text":"Ever the enterprising fellow, I see. Yes, I do have work─the Holy See has begun to speak of mining in earnest. You have been mentioned by name."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Hah, we <span class=\"emphasis\">are</span> workin' our way up in this world!"},{"name":"FORTEMPSKNIGHT02080","text":"There is one caveat, however. House Fortemps cannot promise you any soldiers or workers. You must needs go to the hinterlands unaided, as per the terms of our previous arrangement."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Suits me jus' fine, ser."},{"name":"BABYCHOCO","text":"Cap'n, why in the seven hells'd ye agree to that? Wasn't last time dangerous enough for you!?"},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Too dangerous, to be honest. But the better we make House Fortemps look, the more we'll profit in the long run─even if it means takin' jobs like this."},{"name":"BABYCHOCO","text":"Profit? Long run?

Actin' like that won't accomplish nothin'. Can't save Hatchlin' unless we know where he is...so we find where he is! Some folk 'round here may've seen him!"},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Someone to...? Right! 'Venturers an' treasure hunters live 'round here. Maybe one o' them saw Hatchlin'."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Ahhh, what was her...? Midnight Dew! Aye, that's their leader! You learn what she knows. Me an' Muscles'll see what we can find on our own."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Stop wastin' time, Professor─find out what Midnight Dew knows!"},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"One of Haimirich's men has gone missin'? That's terrible! 'Course I'll help! As a matter of fact, a scout saw a lad leggin' it towards the Rulin' Quarter not a bell past."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"But ever since the last 'venturer went in and never came back, we keep away from the place. We haven't even got a good sense of what's there."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"Only one who passes through there's the gobbie merchant.

Thank you, friend!"},{"name":"GOBLINMERCHANT02084","text":"You are good gobbiefriend! I will help find missing uplander─when I am passing through Ruling Quarter, I hear sound of feet, see man holding sword. I will guide you and your friends there."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"That goblin was singin' your praises, Professor! Said you gave him some legendary ore."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"I'm not rightly sure what you did, but thank you. He's told us that he saw Hatchlin' runnin' about the Rulin' Quarter."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Best of all, he'll guide us in there! Sounds like a perilous place, but we're bound to follow."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Well, me an' Muscles are.

Uplander gives me desire of my heart, what I am longly searching for! For adamantite, I would do it again! Yes, yes, even with risk of painful falling!"},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"'Tis a good thing you got off with only painful fallin', Hatchlin'. If the professor hadn't dug up that ore, we might not have found you alive. "},{"name":"BABYCHOCO","text":"Professor, thank ye. I'm sorry fer everythin' I put ye through."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Hatchlin', I...I think I owe you a tale. About my brother, Gevehard."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"He joined my Raiders 'round the same age as you. An' he was every bit as cocky. Wouldn't back down from a fight, nor take an order."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"But he was my blood. I did my best to rein him in, but it wasn't enough. An' one day, he went too far. It was jus' up in the western highlands. His temper cost one Raider's life, an' put the rest in mortal danger, but off he ran all the same."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"So...I left him. I had to. He died, alone, an' it broke my heart as a brother. But I'd do it again. It <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span> the right decision, as the cap'n."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"...I'm glad we could save you, Hatchlin'. Life, it don't give many chances like this.

Let's follow our merchant friend out o' here."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Professor, I've one last task for you. Could you drop this off with Midnight Dew? Wouldn't sit well with me to leave her unrewarded for her help."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Did Midnight Dew give you one o' her charmin' smiles? Wait, you haven't given her that sack yet?"},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"Well? What happened with that missin' lad?"},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"Thank the Twelve you found him. I appreciate this loot as well─the cap'n knows me too well. We go back a ways, and I know he'd have taken it hard if he'd lost a Raider."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"Can't say I knew he had a brother, though. More'n a few folk go missin' in the western highlands. What'd you say his name was, again?"},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"Gevehard? I...I knew him! He was here!"},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"Called himself a failed sellsword. He was draggin' himself up the road when the gobbies found him. They nursed him back to health, and he served Idyllshire loyally in exchange for their kindness."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"He taught the gobbies how to defend themselves. He died fendin' off enemy advances on the settlement, and they gave him a hero's burial for it."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"Tell Haimirich, would you? He deserves to know."},{"name":"MIDNIGHTDEW","text":"What'll Haimirich say when you tell him his brother lived?"},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"What!? Gevehard <span class=\"emphasis\">lived</span>? But I left him..."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"For years, he's haunted me. Who he could've been, if only I'd been harder on him..."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"But now that I know he didn't die a failure, I can lay his memory to rest. Thank you, Professor. For this, an' for Hatchlin'."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Hah! You're really somethin', you know? A man starts to think o' becomin' a miner when he sees all the good you've done with your pickaxe."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"Jus' between us, I think it's time for Hatchlin' to leave the nest. Keepin' him near only clips his wings in the long run. I'll miss him, but he'll be happier as a 'venturer."},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"The lads an' I can't stay here forever, neither. The world is wide, an' sellswords are needed everywhere. We'll be the most famous company in all Eorzea, jus' you wait an' see!"},{"name":"HEIMIRICH","text":"But no matter where we go, we'll never forget you, Professor─the miner of Oschon's Raiders!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To be deleted."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This concludes the miner quests for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Heavensward.
