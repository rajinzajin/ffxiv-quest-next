I believe we've rested long enough. We should resume our journey before someone notices their missing patrol."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"More soldiers? I didn't think they'd come this far west, but better to be safe than sorry..."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"...We're clear. Only Alliance patrols ahead."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"You said the forces at Castrum Oriens were under the command of Flame General Raubahn Aldynn, did you not?"},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"By Rhalgr! The Bull of Ala Mhigo himself! I never dreamed I'd have a chance to meet the legend..."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"I returned from a survey of the Wall but a moment ago. We have yet to recover Papalymo's personal effects, I am sorry to say, but you may rest assured that we will notify you and yours the moment we do."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Our scouts recently informed me of an interesting development at Castellum Velodyna. Namely, the arrival of a shipment rumored to have come from the research and development facilities near the capital, containing prototype magitek armor."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"It is our assessment that this armor is to be field-tested here, most likely against Alliance forces. Mayhap before the day is out."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"Damn it all, more magitek weapons? That's the last thing we need!"},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Your concern is not unwarranted, but we needn't despair just yet. The shipment is thought to have contained a single heavy unit and one or two support units. With a well-laid ambush, we are confident we can destroy them all, hindering their development and delaying future deployment."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"And should we carry this out as a joint endeavor with the Resistance, they will have their rallying cry."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"It would mean dropping all pretense about the Alliance not wanting to go to war with the Empire...but you'd have a lot more folk willing to stand up and fight if they knew they weren't alone. And you were going to have to do it eventually anyway."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Exactly. And so what I propose is simple: we harry their patrols to bait them into bringing their prototype weapons to East End, where our Resistance allies will take them from behind."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Simple indeed, and well within our capabilities. I see no reason to delay, especially if a field test is imminent. What say you?"},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"Assuming the vice marshal's intelligence is accurate, I agree with his assessment and fully support his plan. I shall notify my comrades at once."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Understood. I shall have one of my men bring you the details of the plan anon."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And we for our part will be fighting with the Alliance, yes? I somehow doubt you were intending to sit this one out."}],"reward":{"gil":680,"items":[{"id":18068,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18080,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18086,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5718,"one":1}],"xp":167400},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":142}],"quests":[67987]},"next":[67989,68175,68176,68177,68178,68179,68180]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1020351","obj":{"i":1020351,"n":"M'naago","l":2406,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020304","obj":{"i":1020304,"n":"Raubahn","l":2406,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020350","obj":{"i":1020350,"n":"Alisaie","l":2406,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020352","obj":{"i":1020352,"n":"Alisaie","l":2406,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020353","obj":{"i":1020353,"n":"M'naago","l":2406,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020354","obj":{"i":1020354,"n":"Pipin","l":2406,"q":9}},{"type":"item","id":"18068","obj":{"i":18068,"n":"Gaganaskin Jacket of Aiming","l":255,"c":42574,"t":35,"p":33323}},{"type":"item","id":"18080","obj":{"i":18080,"n":"Bloodhempen Chestwrap of Healing","l":255,"c":43807,"t":35,"p":33323}},{"type":"item","id":"18086","obj":{"i":18086,"n":"Bloodhempen Chestwrap of Casting","l":255,"c":43806,"t":35,"p":33323}},{"type":"item","id":"5718","obj":{"i":5718,"n":"Quickarm Materia V","l":160,"c":20259,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Skill Speed","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"67987","obj":{"i":67987,"n":"A Friend of a Friend in Need","g":6,"l":"Rhalgr's Reach","s":60}},{"type":"quest","id":"67989","obj":{"i":67989,"n":"Best Served with Cold Steel","g":6,"l":"The Fringes","s":80}},{"type":"quest","id":"68175","obj":{"i":68175,"n":"Magiteknical Failure","g":104,"l":"The Fringes","s":10,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68176","obj":{"i":68176,"n":"Gross Encounters","g":104,"l":"The Fringes","s":20}},{"type":"quest","id":"68177","obj":{"i":68177,"n":"Prison Break","g":104,"l":"The Fringes","s":30}},{"type":"quest","id":"68178","obj":{"i":68178,"n":"What a Tangled Web We Weave","g":104,"l":"The Fringes","s":40}},{"type":"quest","id":"68179","obj":{"i":68179,"n":"Doing Her Part","g":104,"l":"The Fringes","s":60}},{"type":"quest","id":"68180","obj":{"i":68180,"n":"Spicing Things Up","g":104,"l":"The Fringes","s":50}}]}
