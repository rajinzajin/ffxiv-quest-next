Please, help me search for him."},{"name":"RYOSEN","text":"He was right next to me until a short while ago. I cannot believe I lost sight of him so easily."},{"name":"RYOSEN","text":"He was asking a lot of questions about the One River; perhaps he went there searching for something."},{"name":"RYOSEN","text":"Though, I truly hope that is not the case. I have heard that a group of Lupin looters roam the area of late. Please search along the One River for my grandson. I shall continue to look for him here."},{"name":"RYOSEN","text":"Please search for my grandson by the One River. I shall continue to look for him here."},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"Grandfather is looking for me, you say? But I cannot go back just yet! I am still searching for that which was taken from me."},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"I was minding my own business, gathering mugworts, when some nasty Lupin stole them right out of my hands!"},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"Would you ask the Lupin if they would give me back my plants? You'll find them on the other side of the river."},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"Would you ask the Lupin if they would give me back my plants?

I read about it in one of my grandfather's botanicy books! There are so many sick people in the village. I just wanted to help."},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"There is one more thing I need for the medicine: waterweed. I tried to fish some out of the river earlier with a pole. But I didn't have much luck. Could you get some for me?"},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"There is one more thing I need for the medicine: waterweed. It's found at the bottom of rivers. Could you get some for me?"},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"Did you get some waterweed?"},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"Yay! Now I have everything I need!"},{"name":"BOY02733","text":"I'll go back to Grandfather now. Thanks for your help!"},{"name":"RYOSEN","text":"My grandson is at last returned!
