I have such a lot to tell her..."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Perhaps their ministrations were not as thorough as I thought. Or perhaps I was a touch too reckless."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Once more shall the night share equal dominion over the firmament.<br>And yet our travails are far from over..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Is this not the moment Emet-Selch usually chooses to descend upon us? Whatever will we do without his feigned praise and backhanded compliments?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Are you feeling all right, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? After you defeated the Lightwarden, I could swear I saw its aether─"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Uh...never mind. I'm still getting used to my powers. It's probably nothing."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I'm just relieved I was right about where the Warden was hiding."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"The last one is hiding in Kholusia, isn't it? I can't feel it from here, believe it or not..."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"But perhaps we should head back to the Crystarium first. We have a lot to tell the Exarch...and I think we could all do with some rest."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"She sees it too, then."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Y'shtola said she needed to speak with us. It sounded rather urgent."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"The others are with the Exarch. Before we join them, there is something I wish to confirm."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Tell me, Ryne─have you noticed anything peculiar about <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s appearance of late? Anything at all? Speak freely. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span> won't mind."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Well...since Minfilia bequeathed her power to me, I've been able to see the Light inside <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>...though I didn't think anything of it at first. But after we defeated the Warden in Amh Araeng, I realized something was wrong."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"You've absorbed its aether, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. And the Light within you has grown monstrous."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Then it is as I suspected."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"How are you feeling?"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"If naught is done, this will only get worse."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Ryne─with the power of the Oracle, you have gained some measure of control over Light, have you not? Is there anything you can do for <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>?"},{"name":"RYNE","text":"Extinguishing it is out of the question. Even at her strongest, Minfilia could only hold back the Light."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I <span class=\"emphasis\">might</span> be able to suppress it...but I don't know for how long."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Then we have no choice but to rely on Urianger and his secrets."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"If the next battle is to be the last, you may yet be able to play your part. But you will need all of your strength."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"I will discuss strategy with the others and see that everything is made ready for our departure. You are to return to your chambers and rest until then. Understood?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"...Understood."},{"name":"A1","text":"I'm <span class=\"emphasis\">fine</span>. Let me help."},{"name":"A1","text":"Yes, Mother..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Good. Whether you want it or not, you have most certainly earned some respite."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"This is not the time for false bravado. Should your condition worsen, it could have dire consequences for us all."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Now please, return to your chambers and rest."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Hah. None of that cheek, or I will take you across my knee."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Now, off with you to the Pendants. We will call for you when the time comes."},{"name":"GUIDEOFTHEPENDANTS","text":"Is everything all right, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>? You don't seem quite yourself."},{"name":"GUIDEOFTHEPENDANTS","text":"Perhaps a hot meal and a freshly made bed will improve matters. Your room is ready, if you'd care to retire?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"Retire to your quarters?"},{"name":"GUIDEOFTHEPENDANTS","text":"Very good. If you should have need of anything─anything at all─pray do not hesitate to call."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"No, this isn't right."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"It would need to be later.

They'll be upon us any moment."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Very well. Where to next, then?"},{"name":"BLUECLOTHESMAN","text":"Let's just worry about getting out of the city, and pray the airship is still in one piece."},{"name":"BLUECLOTHESMAN","text":"Anywhere we go from here will just be more of the same."},{"name":"BLUECLOTHESMAN","text":"Gods. By the sound of that last one, I reckon the knights twelve might be the knights' rubble now."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Is there nothing else we can do?"},{"name":"BLUECLOTHESMAN","text":"Do? Look around you─this isn't war."},{"name":"BLUECLOTHESMAN","text":"It's a sickness, and it's spread to every corner of Eorzea.
