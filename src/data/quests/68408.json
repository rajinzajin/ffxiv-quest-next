You've come at a good time."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"I received a rather urgent call for assistance from one of our scouts and all of my men are preoccupied with duties elsewhere. "},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"I'd like you to go and speak with Flame Sergeant Dodogun. You'll find him at his post near Gyr Kehim."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"Flame Sergeant Dodogun wouldn't call unless it was of the utmost importance. I suggest you hurry to him."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"So they've sent the morbol slayer, have they? I suppose you'll do."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"A few bells ago, I spotted what looked like a Resistance fighter in a skirmish with the Ananta. As a general rule the Alliance doesn't intervene in local disputes, but I suspect something is amiss. "},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"The altercation took place along a path between the Qalyana and Vira settlements, and neither the Alliance nor the Resistance has any business being there. I wouldn't have been overly concerned if not for the fact that the man I sent down there to investigate hasn't returned."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"I'd like you to go to Sathya Maga and see if he's gotten himself into any trouble. If you find anything, you can contact me via the linkpearl we gave you."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"The recruit I sent down there should have been back by now. If you find anything at Sathya Maga, don't hesitate to contact me."},{"name":"POP","text":"You are under attack!"},{"name":"RECRUIT02872","text":"Phew. Thank you, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. I've never seen one of the Ananta so angry. She wouldn't even speak─only ceaseless hissing with seemingly murderous intent. If not for you I would likely be dead like that gentleman just over there."},{"name":"RECRUIT02872","text":"From what I could gather before we were assaulted, he was seizing crystals from their encampment. I assumed it was to stop the summoning of a primal."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Flame Sergeant Dodogun-)Ahem. Forgive the intrusion, but judging by his uniform, I'm not so sure he was a member of the Resistance to begin with. Well, I wouldn't call it a uniform so much as an unconvincing costume. He likely stole bits and pieces off of fallen soldiers. "},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Flame Sergeant Dodogun-)I also very much doubt he was here for crystals. You can clearly see the jewelry hanging out of his satchel. Nothing but a petty thief if you ask me."},{"name":"RECRUIT02872","text":"Y-You can see all of this from your post!?"},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"(-Flame Sergeant Dodogun-)There's a reason <span class=\"emphasis\">I'm</span> stationed up here and not you, soldier.

Thank you again for your help."},{"name":"DODOGUN","text":"You did well out there. I'd treat you to that drink I promised, but, as you can see, the new recruits keep us busy. Maybe next time."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"Welcome back, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span></span><span class=\"alternative\">[GC Rank]</span><span class=\"alternative\"> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span></span></span>. What have you to report?"},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"I see. It's not often I disagree with the flame sergeant, but I'm not so sure this man was some wayward thief. After all, the Resistance is quite expansive, and comprised of many different groups."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"While the forces stationed at Rhalgr's Reach are the most involved in our fight against the Garleans, there are other smaller factions─some even formed haphazardly─who claim to be Resistance fighters if only for the chance to loot and plunder."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"It is imperative this man is identified to determine who can be held accountable. &lt;sigh&gt; If we had more recruits like you we likely wouldn't have to worry about such things."},{"name":"SWETHRYKBROOKSTONE","text":"At any rate, you've been of great help.
