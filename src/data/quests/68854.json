Prove yourself against them, and I will consider giving you the relic."},{"name":"SETO","text":"See that you are well prepared, then meet me in the clearing to the east."},{"name":"SETO","text":"There, I will lure out the fiends, that you may slay them."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Whatever Seto hath in store for thee, I wish thee godsspeed."},{"name":"SETO","text":"I will use my voice to lure out the sin eaters, as I once did when I hunted with an old friend."},{"name":"SETO","text":"A feeble cry for the ravenous; a mighty roar for the territorial...
