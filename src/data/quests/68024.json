I know it! I just hope Gosetsu and the others are all right..."},{"name":"BUNCHIN","text":"Beneath the waters to the west of Sui–no–Sato lies a cave that will lead you to the Isle of Zekki. May the kami watch over and keep you."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"I don't know about you two, but I'm as ready as I'll ever be."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Me too. Let's do this!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Right. Right. Naught left to say, then..."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"To the Isle of Zekki!"},{"name":"A1","text":"You nervous?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"R-Right! Let's go and find that cave!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Me? Nervous? Come now. I mean, it's not as though I haven't risked my life in ridiculous ways before."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, maybe I am a little bit... Hm. Strangest thing, that. Completely out of character, even. Anyway, let's go!"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I hope you didn't waste too much energy swimming here. Once the fighting starts, I doubt we'll have a moment to rest."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Assuming this is the right cave, it should lead us straight into the heart of the Isle of Zekki..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Have you got a plan for once we get to the isle?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Hmm... How about two of us get the guards' attention while the third heads straight for the vault?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Afterwards, the other two join them there, and together we make a stand. With our numbers, it's not feasible to do anything more complicated, I think."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Fine by me. I like simple plans. I'll be one of the decoys, then."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"You read my mind. I also had a mind to ask <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> to be one, given <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> peerless martial prowess."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Then it's settled. You two will make your way through the stronghold, creating as much chaos as possible. You know, have some fun."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Meanwhile, I will attempt to locate the vault and gain entry with the ceremonial knife. When I am inside, I will contact you via linkpearl."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Right! Come on, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! We've got work to do!"},{"name":"BALLOON","text":"Intruders!?

Is that the best you can do!?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"There you are! The entrance is straight ahead."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Good timing, I might add. It sounds like the whole garrison is headed straight for us..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We should, um...we should definitely talk strategy before we do anything else!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; That...that was not part of the plan! A Kojin primal was most definitely not part of the plan!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...Though I am sure there is a perfectly logical explanation involving the aether stored in the treasures and the religious fervor with which the Kojin guard them. Or something. &lt;sigh&gt; A pity Alphinaud isn't here to provide it."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"And just when I thought our fortunes had changed. I swear, if Soroban and his people knew this might happen..."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...No, somehow I doubt that. Even the Red seemed surprised by what happened."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"All rises and falls at the whim of capricious fortune, does it? Then the same goes for him.
