Go to Eil Tohm and slay the inconsiderate hropken, then fill the empty ewer Mogret gave you with water for the flowers.","The hropken will no longer be a problem for the moogles of Moghome, and the once-empty ewer is now filled with sparkling spring water. Bring it to Mogret before her flowers wilt away into nothing.","Mogret is ecstatic that her flowers will be able to bloom even further.
