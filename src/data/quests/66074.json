See what Nicoliaux knows of the timbermaster's troubles.","Nicoliaux tells you of an argument between Beatin and Gairhard which seemed to concern an old bow. Unable to calm himself, Beatin expelled his friend from the guild. While Nicoliaux attempts to console the timbermaster, speak with Gairhard at the Adders' Nest to learn more of this incident.","Gairhard does not go into detail about the argument, instead explaining that his commission is of grave import. Having no other recourse, he asks you to craft a cobalt halberd, a jade crook, and a yew longbow. To ensure that the weapons are of superior quality, he also requests that you present them to Beatin for inspection before delivering them to him.","Having recovered somewhat from his earlier malaise, Beatin evaluates and approves of your products. Return to the Adders' Nest and deliver the items to Gairhard.","After thanking you for your hard work, Gairhard acknowledges that he is as much at fault as Beatin for the earlier dispute. Nevertheless, he and his squad must soon depart Gridania on their next mission, and he will not have another chance to visit the timbermaster for quite some time. Give the captain's regards to Beatin.","Beatin is saddened to hear of Gairhard's departure, though he understands it to be an unavoidable consequence of life as a soldier. He also reveals to you the nature of the previous argument. Apparently, the timbermaster had refused to accept the commission until the captain allowed him to replace Gairhard's old longbow. Though he fears Gairhard's weapon will not last another moon, he regrets having lost his temper, and hopes that his friend will return soon.<br><br>※The next carpenter quest will be available from Beatin upon reaching level 50."],"objectives":["Speak with Nicoliaux.","Speak with Gairhard.","Present a cobalt halberd <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\">, a jade crook <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\">, and a yew longbow <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Beatin.","Deliver the cobalt halberd <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\">, the jade crook <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\">, and the yew longbow <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Gairhard.","Report to Beatin."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BEATINE","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Not now, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

Leave me to my work. If you still desire company, perhaps young Nicoliaux will serve."},{"name":"NICOLIAUX","text":"I remember you! <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, right? Let me guess: Beatin told you to go away again."},{"name":"NICOLIAUX","text":"He's been like that since Gairhard left. He had some commission for the guild, but Beatin wouldn't accept it because of an old bow or something."},{"name":"NICOLIAUX","text":"There was shouting, and Beatin threw him out. They were both acting like younglings..."},{"name":"NICOLIAUX","text":"I don't know if it'll help, but maybe you should talk with Gairhard about what happened. I think he went back to the Adders' Nest."},{"name":"NICOLIAUX","text":"Leave old Beatin to me. I'll talk some sense into him."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? What brings you here?"},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"...So you heard about what happened at the guild. It is unfortunate that the children bore witness to our dispute."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; And it is even more unfortunate that I must ask you to become involved. My request was intended for the timbermaster himself, but since he has refused me, I have no choice."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"I need a cobalt halberd, a jade crook, and a yew longbow─your best quality, and as fast as possible."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"This equipment is required for a mission of grave import, which is why I first approached the timbermaster. But you are also a proven artisan, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, so I think I can safely entrust it to you."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"Nevertheless, I must ask that you present the finished items to Beatin for inspection. If he judges them acceptable, then I will gladly accept."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"Given the nature of this mission, I must ask that you first present the finished weapons to Beatin for inspection. I can only accept your work once it has met with his approval."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; I feel it necessary to apologize for my earlier behavior, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. It was unbecoming of a timbermaster. ...Ah, so you agreed to fill Gairhard's order. Very well, let me see what you have wrought."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"You chose your bow staves wisely. I see no imperfections in the yew which would interfere with performance."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"The rosewood reinforcements appear solid, and the sinew bowstring is of excellent quality."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"I have no objections to this bow."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"And I believe this is the first time I have judged a halberd of your creation. Fascinating weapons, halberds."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Did you know they were a Hellsguard invention? Their marauders first used them to repel mounted units. A skilled wielder could easily pull a rider from his saddle."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"As for this particular halberd, I have no criticisms. In fact, given the quality of the axe blade, I can't help but wonder if you've been studying blacksmithing..."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Though, even if you <span class=\"emphasis\">were</span> pursuing other disciplines, this crook proves that you have not neglected your carpentry."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"The luxurious reddish browns of the mahogany, the entrancing greens of the jadeite..."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"It is a true expression of Gridanian philosophy, a triumph of craftsmanship made only with the necessary materials. Bravo, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"I was wrong to deny Gairhard. But, thanks to you, his squad will not suffer for my stubbornness."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"I only pray that he reconsiders my offer... Ah, yes─you may proceed with the delivery."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"Beatin had no objections? Excellent! Then if you would hand me the weapons..."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"When we first met, the quality of your work was already impressive. I must say, though, that looking at your most recent products, it's clear even to me that you have grown tremendously, both professionally and personally."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"Or maybe it's more obvious when contrasted with Beatin's─ &lt;sigh&gt; No, that is hypocritical of me to say. I am as much to blame for our squabble as he."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"I swear, when we fought, it was as though nothing had ever changed."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"In any case, I thank you for your hard work. This next mission may be our most dangerous yet, and it gives me great comfort to know my squad is equipped with the finest weapons."},{"name":"GAIRHARD","text":"It may be some time before I see you and Beatin again. Please give him my regards."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Was he pleased, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?<br>...Oh. Once again, he fails to deliver his farewells in person."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"Yet a soldier must serve, and a carpenter must craft. These are the lives we have chosen."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"I tried to reason with him. I offered to replace his longbow. But he refuses to face reality."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"That bow will not last another moon, if even that."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"But my fervent protestations fell on deaf ears. I allowed my temper to overwhelm me, and I said many things I now regret."},{"name":"BEATINE","text":"When he returns to Gridania, we should have much to discuss.
