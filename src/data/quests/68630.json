Bah, no matter! For I, Hildibrand, agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire, am back in the game! And what a game it is, my friends, for in a Far Eastern town replete with intrigue, a dastardly Wolf Burglar preys upon the wealthy and powerful! Just deserts, some might say, but crime is crime, no matter the victim! Yea, injustice is a cancer, and I am the barber's blade!<br>　　　　　　　　　　　　*　*　*<br>The notorious Wolf Burglar of Kugane has struck again, and Shigure is eager to proceed to the scene of the crime. Inspector Hildibrand and his faithful assistant have likely already arrived ahead of you, but if you hurry, you may make it in time to prevent them from further complicating the situation.","Contrary to what you had heard, the Wolf Burglar's latest attempt to steal a priceless treasure─the Soboro Sukehiro─ended in failure. The owner of the sword, Master Akebono, credits this fortunate turn of events to his new bodyguard, Yojimbo. Though Shigure warns the wealthy merchant that the thief is certain to make another attempt, and offers to aid his men in protecting the sword, Master Akebono refuses. The young ronin's further efforts to persuade him only try his patience, and it is not long before Master Akebono storms off, eager to attend a prior engagement in Sanjo Hanamachi. Crestfallen, Shigure fears all is lost─but Hildibrand has never been one to give up so easily.","Yet again the direct approach ends in failure, as Akebono's man is unwilling to allow any but a “geiko of surpassing beauty” to see his master. Somehow these words spur Hildibrand to concoct an equally beauteous plan, the first step of which is to proceed to a nearby okiya and speak with an acquaintance of Shigure's.","The proprietress of the okiya is not one to mince words, and so when Hildibrand implores her to clothe Nashu in her finest kimono, she refuses. A geiko's garments are her livelihood, and none would dare be so reckless as to lend hers to a stranger...for nothing. She demands a fee which Hildibrand is quick to offer to pay, only to find that he is without the means to do so. Fortunately, in his altogether brief time in Kugane, the inspector has gained insight into the Hingan mind─to wit, he has heard that one might impress upon a Hingan the depth of his conviction by removing every hair from his head. Nashu volunteers to do the honors, and in a flash, she succeeds...in shaving Shigure bald─the sight of which sends the proprietress into a fit of laughter. Duly satisfied, she agrees to disguise Nashu as a geiko, and shortly thereafter you are ready to proceed to the next stage of the plan.","The doorman is more than willing to let Nashu pass, albeit alone. Yet Inspector Hildibrand's plan of surpassing beauty is far from finished, and it is not long before he too infiltrates the meeting, having made his best effort to disguise himself as a geiko. Shortly thereafter you and Shigure hear shouting, and rush to the room to find the Wolf Burglar in the act of stealing the Soboro Sukehiro while the occupants bicker amongst themselves. Alas, with the aid of a smoke bomb, he makes good his escape, leaving you and your comrades at the mercy of an irate Akebono demanding that you remove yourself from his sight.","Though Shigure cares less and less for Akebono, he knows all too well that the merchant will not hesitate to use his influence to crush him should he fail to recover the Soboro Sukehiro. The Wolf Burglar must be found. Fortunately, the ronin already knows where he might have fled..."],"objectives":["Search for Hildibrand.","Follow Akebono.","Speak with Hildibrand.","Speak with Akebono's bodyguard.","Speak with Shigure."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"Have you heard, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?

I, Hildibrand, agent of enquiry, inspector extraordinaire, am given to understand that you are an acquaintance of Shigure here?"},{"name":"LANDLADY03094","text":"Aye, I've given the hapless fool a handout or two. And now he shows up on my doorstep in the company of ijin “inspectors.” I can only assume this means he's yet to find honest work."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Indeed, much to all our chagrin, Shigure is not gainfully employed at present, but that regrettable circumstance is not what brings us to you!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Nay, it is a matter of far greater import─a grave injustice which must be averted at all costs. To that end, my lady, I would have you clothe my steadfast assistant in your finest kimono!

I'm not sure what mischief you inspectors get up to in your line of work, but in ours, a kimono is priceless.

A means by which we may achieve our end without spending a single coin!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"In my brief time here, I have come to understand the myriad complexities of Hingan culture.

I don't think I've laughed so hard in ages!"},{"name":"LANDLADY03094","text":"Chin up, Shigure. I daresay she did you a favor. The Sekiseigumi might be inclined to take you more seriously now."},{"name":"LANDLADY03094","text":"You can have your kimono, with my thanks. Never mind the gil. The entertainment you've given me is payment enough."},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"My lady, you are a saint!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Are you ready, Nashu?"},{"name":"NASHUMHAKARACCA","text":"Always, Inspector! Wait here, everyone─I'm sure it won't take long to put one of these things on, right?"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Verily, there is no greater truth than that if we trust in ourselves and the gods, fate shall conspire to see us succeed!"},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"Is this the will of the kami...?"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"I believe I hear them coming!"},{"name":"NASHUMHAKARACCA","text":"Ta-daaa!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"My dear Nashu, you look incredible!"},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"Wow... Actually, yes, you do. You do!"},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"She looks every bit the geiko. I cannot fathom that doorman turning her away!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Come, my friends! Let us put Nashu's disguise to the proof!"},{"name":"LANDLADY03094","text":"So inspectors are mummers, are they? That show they put on was better than some of the dross I've seen in the Mujikoza theater!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Say what you will about the rest of us, but you would have to be blind to disparage my stalwart ass─ That is, the lovely geiko, Nashu!"},{"name":"KUGANEGUARDA","text":"A geiko, eh? All right. Let's have a look at you..."},{"name":"KUGANEGUARDA","text":"Oh ho ho, and where has this lovely lass been hiding? Master Akebono's sure to take a shine to you..."},{"name":"KUGANEGUARDA","text":"All right. The girl may enter─and no one else!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Huzzah! It worked!"},{"name":"NASHUMHAKARACCA","text":"Wish me luck!"},{"name":"SHIGURE","text":"Though...is it wise to let her go alone? Ideally at least <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> or myself should have accompanied her, no?"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Oh, Shigure. I did tell you it was a plan of “surpassing beauty,” did I not?"},{"name":"AKEBONO","text":"The sword without peer, the Soboro Sukehiro; the geiko without peer, Chiyoume! What fortune that I may enjoy the company of the finest treasures the world has to offer. Their very presence makes the wine taste that much sweeter."},{"name":"KUMODE","text":"(-Dead-eyed Miscreant-)I could not agree more, my lord! Alas, whereas you may lay hands upon your magnificent blade at whim, in vain I struggle to navigate the endless labyrinth that is a woman's fickle heart..."},{"name":"AKEBONO","text":"That which I desire, I take. As will you─when my little project is complete."},{"name":"KUMODE","text":"(-Dead-eyed Miscreant-)Chiyoume! Come and have a drink with us! Come, come!"},{"name":"CHIYOUME","text":"If my lords insist, I should be glad to partake..."},{"name":"KUMODE","text":"(-Dead-eyed Miscreant-)Such a beautiful girl you are, and so skilled a dancer as well! You deserve only the best─and the very best you shall have...if you but give yourself body and soul to me."},{"name":"CHIYOUME","text":"I fear my lord's rather admirable perseverance encroaches upon the obsessive. As I am sure I have told you a thousand times before, I should be glad to entertain one and all with the traditional arts..."},{"name":"KUMODE","text":"(-Dead-eyed Miscreant-)Stubborn as ever, I see. No matter. In due time you will be mine... One way or another."},{"name":"NASHUMHAKARACCA","text":"Begging your pardons, m'lords!"},{"name":"KUMODE","text":"(-Dead-eyed Miscreant-)Oho, this is a welcome surprise! My lord, did you call for another geiko? Never mind─ Come, my dear! Have a seat!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"(-???-)Salutations and greetings, my good sirs!"},{"name":"AKEBONO","text":"What...what is the meaning of this! I explicitly said I would be receiving no taikomochi this day!"},{"name":"KUMODE","text":"(-Dead-eyed Miscreant-)Far be it from me to judge a man for his pleasures, my lord, but I fear this is a bridge too far for me!"},{"name":"YOJIMBO","text":"Such beauty... Such grace..."},{"name":"AKEBONO","text":"B-Be that as it may, now is not the time! The day after tomorrow, perhaps, after I have had time to recover─but not today!"},{"name":"HILDIBRAND","text":"Will my lord not reconsider?

Yojimbo─remove this fetching-yet-belligerent taikomochi from my sight!"},{"name":"YOJIMBO","text":"Lay hands upon a fair maiden? I will do no such thing."},{"name":"AKEBONO","text":"Are you defying your master's order?
