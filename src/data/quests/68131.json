With poorly concealed concern, she asks that you check on the veteran artisan the next time you find yourself in Kugane...for the sake of the guild, of course.","You find Blanstyr standing as if spellbound by the armor on a statue in Kugane, but otherwise safe and sound. Although the shrewd craftsman immediately accuses you of spying for H'naanza, he shows no hesitation in requesting your help with finding a local forge. Head into the artisans' district and catch up with Blanstyr.","Blanstyr approaches the master of Kokajiya and explains how the design of a Heavensturn helmet inspired him to develop his own unique style. Fugetsu mistakes you for another hopeful apprentice, and you find yourself assigned the same crafting task as Blanstyr. Speak with Unryu, and request the materials needed to synthesize a high-quality suit of paladin mail.","Unryu hands over the supplies you need, and reminds you to present your finished work to Fugetsu.<br><br>※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Unryu.","Fugetsu is duly impressed with your finely crafted set of Eorzean-style armor, and promises to commence your lessons once he is finished honoring an important commission. Share your success with Blanstyr.","Blanstyr seems pleased that you have both been accepted as apprentices, and restates his determination to work on developing an individual style. Until Fugetsu is free to begin your instruction, however, it seems you must be content with improving yourself by exploring the properties of the local materials.<br><br>※The next armorer quest will be available from Blanstyr upon reaching level 65."],"objectives":["Search for Blanstyr in Kugane.","Speak with Blanstyr.","Speak with Unryu.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Synthesize a suit of paladin mail <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"></span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the suit of paladin mail <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Fugetsu</span></span>.","Speak with Blanstyr."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HNAANZA","text":"Blanstyr should have arrived on Far Eastern shores by now, but I've heard not a word from the old aurochs..."},{"name":"HNAANZA","text":"There was no news of storms or ships lost at sea, so I must assume he made it to Kugane. Have you been there yourself?"},{"name":"HNAANZA","text":"Should you happen to have business on that side of the world, I'd consider it a favor if you could look in on him for me."},{"name":"HNAANZA","text":"Personality aside, Blanstyr is one of our best artisans, and losing him to some mishap would be a terrible blow...for the guild, of course."},{"name":"HNAANZA","text":"Keep an eye out for Blanstyr the next time you're in Kugane, would you? I need to know he's alive and breathing...in my capacity as forgemaster, you understand."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!? Byregot's beard, I thought ye looked familiar! H'naanza sent ye to spy on me, did she?"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"I arrived a while ago, truth be told, but this bloody statue caught me eye an' refused to let go. Just look at the armor on that bloke! Ye don't see naught like that in Eorzea!"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Well, I'd best not stand around gawpin' all day─I need to find a smithy, an' see if they're willin' to teach an old hand like me."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Here, do ye want to come along an' help look, then?"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">lad</span></span>.

Right, well there's naught to be gained by bein' shy."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Beggin' yer pardon, sir, but who might be the master o' this forge? I've traveled here from Eorzea, with a mind to learnin' yer style of armorsmithin'..."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Well, well. In all my years, never have I had a foreigner seek an apprenticeship at my anvil. Pray tell me more of your aspirations."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"...Hang on, so yer the master o' this place, then?"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"So the fates have decreed. I am Fugetsu, Kokajiya's humble proprietor and chief armorer."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Oh, I... Pleased to meet ye. The name's Blanstyr. I'm an armorer from Limsa Lominsa, the city where I learned me craft."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"See, I was taken by the strikin' design o' the helms yer countrymen was givin' out on Heavensturn, an' reckoned that I'd like to study with the artisan what crafted 'em. I asked about, an' the answers sent me here, to Kugane..."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Ah, the Heavensturn helmets. If you seek the man who forged those pieces, then you need look no further. Was there some particular aspect of the design that drew your attention?"},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Those were yers, then!? Bugger me, that was easy. ...Ahem. To answer yer question, I've been feelin' that me own work has fallen into a bit of a rut, an' the distinct personality o' them helms is exactly what I've been missin'!"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"The search for one's own style can certainly be a trial. Very well, I should be glad to aid you in finding yours."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Ye will!? Thank ye, sir!"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Ordinarily I teach but one student at a time, but it will be a refreshing challenge to instruct the two of you together. I look forward to the experience."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Before we begin, however, I would gauge your skills as artisans. Would you craft for me a set of quality Eorzean armor?"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"My apprentice, Unryu, will provide you with the necessary materials. Present your work to me when you are finished."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Er, I guess he thought ye was here for the same reason as me. But ye can't pass up this chance, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! We can learn the secrets o' Far Eastern armorsmithin' side by side!"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Is there some confusion regarding your task? I require from you a suit of Eorzean armor that I might evaluate your relative skill. Speak with Unryu, and he shall furnish you with the raw materials you need."},{"name":"BLANSTYR","text":"Fugetsu's decided yer here to learn, an' I see no reason to correct him. This could be the chance of a lifetime, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─I suggest ye take it!"},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Master Fugetsu explained to me your task. If you would tell me the type of armor you plan to forge, then I shall requisition the appropriate metals from our stores."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Ah, a suit of mail, is it? I believe these materials should suffice, but do not hesitate to request more should you find them lacking."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"Once the armor is complete, you may present it directly to Master Fugetsu. I pray sincerely for your success─a junior apprentice would be most welcome at the forge."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To proceed with the quest, use the materials provided by Unryu to craft a high-quality suit of paladin mail."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Should your synthesis efforts prove unsuccessful, speak with Unryu once more to receive another set of materials."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To begin the crafting process, select <span class=\"highlight\">Logs</span> from the main menu, followed by <span class=\"highlight\">Crafting Log</span>.

As I explained, you may present your work directly to Master Fugetsu. I am but a lowly apprentice."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"I trust our materials were sufficient for the task?"},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"...A fine piece─you have shown considerable skill in working this amount of detail into such a durable alloy."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Though the techniques you employ are not the same as ours, your experience as an artisan is readily apparent. I am curious to see how you will fare with our traditional methods."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"But whilst I am eager to begin your instruction, I am afraid an important commission must take precedence. Pray use this time to familiarize yourself with the local materials, and I shall inform you when your lessons are to commence."},{"name":"FUGETSU","text":"Kokajiya is in the process of filling a valued commission. I suggest you spend your time learning the peculiarities of our local materials whilst we work to honor our client's request."},{"name":"UNRYU","text":"I am entrusted with overseeing Kokajiya's supply stores.
