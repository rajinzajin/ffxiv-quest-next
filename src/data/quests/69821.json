What in the blazes are you doing here?<br>Hold on─ You seem...thinner somehow."},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"Hmm... You have much in common with <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> but it's clear you're not one of us. A familiar perhaps?"},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"I suppose it's just like <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> to send one of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> minions to poke its nose into our affairs. But since you're here, instead of hanging around like a bad smell, why don't you make yourself useful?"},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"I want you to take this latest work of mine─a new variety of fruit─to my colleagues."},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"In the meantime, I will be cultivating more specimens in the Cthonic Horns. Yes, you heard that correctly. Cultivating, not simply conjuring with creation magicks. Aye, the fruit I produce is a labor of love."},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"Now that my newest masterpiece is close to completion, I would have my fellow researchers sample its delights. I wish to hear their impressions before I make the final adjustments."},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"Unfortunately, for all their wisdom, I find them intolerable at the best of times, never mind when they are critiquing my work. For that reason, I would have you go in my stead. And be quick about it─lest the fruit spoil as a result of your dawdling."},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"Yes? Is something the matter? I've already given you your instructions, and I'd prefer not to repeat myself. Now go."},{"name":"OBSERVERA04285","text":"You are the familiar who arrived with Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus, yes? And what do we have here?"},{"name":"OBSERVERA04285","text":"A new species of fruit, eh? Let us hope it tastes better than it looks."},{"name":"OBSERVERA04285","text":"My word!"},{"name":"OBSERVERA04285","text":"What an unusual flavor! Equal parts bitter, musty, and tart...and not entirely unpleasant. I am curious to know how such a thing was created."},{"name":"OBSERVERA04285","text":"Grown from seed in the Cthonic Horns, you say? In my experience, leaving such things to nature leads to wildly varying results. To have bred such a specimen must've been incredibly time-consuming, not to mention inefficient."},{"name":"OBSERVERB04285","text":"You wish to speak with me?"},{"name":"OBSERVERB04285","text":"My impressions? Very well."},{"name":"OBSERVERB04285","text":"Good gracious, what...is this!?"},{"name":"OBSERVERB04285","text":"It's so outrageously bitter, something akin to a wave of icy cold has spread throughout my entire body!"},{"name":"OBSERVERB04285","text":"I certainly wouldn't eat this out of choice, but it could be made into medicine for staving off the heat in arid environments."},{"name":"OBSERVERC04285","text":"Are you lost, little familiar?"},{"name":"OBSERVERC04285","text":"For me? Why yes, I should love to try a piece!"},{"name":"OBSERVERC04285","text":"Hmm..."},{"name":"OBSERVERC04285","text":"I don't mean to be rude, but this falls somewhere between “rather foul” and “positively revolting.” It's so bitter, it's practically inedible."},{"name":"OBSERVERC04285","text":"More important, however, is the question of whether this fruit would serve its intended function. If wild animals cannot bring themselves to eat it, the seeds will never be spread. I can't imagine this creation being approved in its current state."},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"You are returned, minus three fruit samples, I presume?"},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"Is that so? Not one of them found it to their liking? They claimed my last attempt was too sweet, and now it's too bitter!? Honestly, the nerve of these so-called experts!"},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"As they shall soon learn, I am not so easily deterred."},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"For my next creation, I'll cross-pollinate sour and sweet varieties, and see what they have to say about <span class=\"emphasis\">that</span>!"},{"name":"ELEGANCECREATOR04285","text":"I'll show them it's these “wildly varying results” that come from adherence to natural processes that have the power to defy expectations! And as the familiar of Azem <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">herself</span><span class=\"alternative\">himself</span></span>, I'm sure you can appreciate that!"}],"reward":{"gil":655},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[69961]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1041537","obj":{"i":1041537,"n":"Pompous Creator","l":3713,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69961","obj":{"i":69961,"n":"Their Greatest Contribution","g":11,"l":"Elpis","s":579}}]}
