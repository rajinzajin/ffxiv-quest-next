Unable to sneak past their heightened security, the Vath keeneye asks you to raid the enemy settlement in his stead. Your goal is to procure three jars of a special paste and three bags of blackloam.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.

Return quickly to Loth ast Vath and deliver them to the Vath keeneye.","The Vath keeneye is pleased to see you return safely. As you hand over the spoils taken from the Gnath stronghold, you cannot help but notice his quizzical expression. He tells you these items are a special food reserved for soldiers of the Onemind, which is why he is so puzzled by the hunters' plans. The paste, he says, will be used for rearing chocobos.
