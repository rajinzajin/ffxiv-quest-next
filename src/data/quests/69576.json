Gerolt is confident that fifteen relics should suffice for your plans, and so you set out in search of dark, perilous ruins, hoping his guess is on the mark.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.<br>※Timeworn artifacts can be obtained by completing the raid Delubrum Reginae, or the deep dungeon Palace of the Dead.","You return to Gangos with a hard-earned assortment of artifacts. Loaded into the Allagan node, along with the Resistance weapon, the refinement process thereafter is surprisingly painless. Almost suspiciously so. Zlatan and Gerolt then discuss the feasibility of repeating the refinement process, prompting an equally suspicious recording from the Allagan node, extolling wares from the House of Splendors that would save you the trouble of finding more artifacts, albeit at a price. Zlatan would not forbid you from purchasing from the House of Splendors, but he is understandably keen to avoid any unnecessary dealings with the notoriously unscrupulous Rowena."],"objectives":["<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Obtain timeworn artifacts</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Bastard Sword and Law's Order Kite Shield</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Knuckles</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Labrys</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Spear</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Composite Bow</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Cane</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Rod</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Index</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Codex</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Knives</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Revolver</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Zweihander</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Astrometer</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Samurai Blade</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Rapier</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Manatrigger</span><span class=\"alternative\">Law's Order Chakrams</span><span class=\"alternative\">With  in your inventory or Armoury Chest, deliver the timeworn artifacts to the Allagan node at Gangos</span></span>."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Please note that upon completing the quest “A New Path of Resistance,” you will receive a Resistance weapon for <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">an [Job]</span><span class=\"alternative\">a [Job]</span></span>."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Please ensure you have changed to your desired job before speaking with Zlatan."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you do?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Undertake this quest as another job."},{"name":"A2","text":"Undertake this quest as <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">an [Job]</span><span class=\"alternative\">a [Job]</span></span>."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Please speak with Zlatan again when you are ready to undertake this quest."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have already received [Error] and [Error].
