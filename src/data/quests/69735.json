Who could have done this?"},{"name":"VARPASA","text":"It wasn't you, was it? ...No, it couldn't have been. Besides, an upstanding adventurer like yourself wouldn't be so cruel as to steal my wares... You wouldn't be willing to lend a hand in getting them back, would you?"},{"name":"VARPASA","text":"Oh thank you, thank you!"},{"name":"VARPASA","text":"He looked to be male, about this tall, and dressed in all black alchemist's garb. That's all I can tell you. I didn't get a good look at him before he ran off toward Akyaali."},{"name":"VARPASA","text":"I can't trust anyone here... Who knows how many accomplices he has lurking about? But you're not from here, so you're in the clear.

He must have traveled here from somewhere else."},{"name":"VARPASA","text":"All sorts of people come to Radz-at-Han, not all of them respectable. The freedom of the city calls people from all lands and walks of life."},{"name":"VARPASA","text":"He must have been aboard the same vessel as me, seeing as he knew I was transporting valuables and tailed me from the port. I'll need to be more careful of my surroundings from now on. If only everyone were as trustworthy as you!"},{"name":"VARPASA","text":"In any case, I'm almost glad this was a clear-cut robbery.
