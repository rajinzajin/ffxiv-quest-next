Aye, your eyes are starting to have the sharpness of a predator about them."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Last time, you learned the basics of combinations. Today, I would have you build on that knowledge."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"I've set up five wooden dummies outside the guild, along the Merchant Strip. By way of a warm-up, I want you to deal each a solid Bootshine combo. Oh, and don't mind the townsfolk who've gathered to watch."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Well, what are you waiting for? Go and unleash your fists of fury on the wooden dummies!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The mannequin stands there, and though it is silent, you cannot help but feel it is mocking you."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"So the wooden dummies have felt your wrath? Good! Now we can move on to your lesson."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"When you first came to us, I taught you that combinations make a pugilist. What you need to know next is that not any hotchpotch of strikes makes a combination. There's an order to things─a natural flow from one technique to another."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Today, I would have you practice one of the most elementary combinations in a pugilist's arsenal. It goes like this:"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Lead in with a swift <span class=\"emphasis\">Bootshine</span> combo! Keep your foe off balance with a <span class=\"emphasis\">True Strike</span>! Then bring it home with a blistering <span class=\"emphasis\">Snap Punch</span>! With practice, combinations such as this will become second nature. They must if you expect to become an accomplished pugilist."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Now, you'll need some opponents to practice on. The Qiqirn that infest the Rat's Nest in central Thanalan ought to serve. Hit them with Snap Punch three times, and we'll call it a lesson well learned."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Forgotten what to do? Make your way to the Rat's Nest in central Thanalan, and challenge the Qiqirn there. Hit them with Snap Punch three times, and we'll call it a lesson well learned."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Eh!? Y-You've already mastered the Snap Punch combination!? Crikey, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you're a natural at it, just like I was!"},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Not to brag, but I happen to be a veritable <span class=\"emphasis\">storm</span> of flying fists when the mood strikes me. I'd treat you to a demonstration here and now, except..."},{"name":"CHUCHUTO","text":"\"...I'm liable to tear down the entire guild in the process.“"},{"name":"CHUCHUTO","text":"Master Hamon has a penchant for regaling us with tales of his exploits, but these never amount to a demonstration. His favorite is his victory over the fearsome marauder, Wideaxe, whom he felled with a combination so swift and seamless, they say you couldn't see his hands...or so the legend goes."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Hah hah hah! That one never gets old!"},{"name":"CHUCHUTO","text":"Our dearest master's humility aside, your progress is truly astounding, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. If I don't keep on my toes, you're like to surpass me in a matter of moons."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Just between you and me, Chuchuto's been in a slump of late. It all began when her closest friend and guildmate suddenly up and disappeared. Rurukuta's the lad's name, and he and Chuchuto joined the guild together."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"The two of them were born to refugees, and were orphaned in the Calamity. Not long after I was made guildmaster, I found them on the streets, starved near to death. I did what any decent man would─I took them in, and clothed them and fed them."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"When they were strong again, they said they wanted to become pugilists like me, and so I trained them as well. Since then, they've been best friends and rivals both, one helping to raise the other up. &lt;sigh&gt; Would that we knew what's become of Rurukuta..."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"But we were talking about you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"You've proven yourself a worthy member of our guild, training hard and learning fast. To recognize your efforts, I grant you leave to join other guilds."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"Of course, before you can take up another discipline, you need to receive permission from the relevant guildmaster."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"If combat's your calling, you might like to seek out the gladiators or thaumaturges. But if you'd prefer an alternative to cracking skulls, Ul'dah's also famous for its weavers, goldsmiths, alchemists, and miners."},{"name":"HAMON","text":"As your guildmaster, though, it'd please me most if you placed our art above others. But whatever you choose to do, know that I wish you the best."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You now have access to the Armoury system. Quests to unlock the other classes can be undertaken by speaking to the receptionist in the corresponding guild."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"There exist myriad disciplines in Eorzea that adventurers can take up.
