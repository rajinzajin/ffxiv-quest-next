Till then, I wish you well."},{"name":"JILLIAN","text":"Excellent! I shall let Guildmaster Ywain know to expect you."},{"name":"JILLIAN","text":"All who seek admittance to our ranks must present themselves before him. He will judge if you are fit to become one of us."},{"name":"JILLIAN","text":"Pray make your way to the training area within. Our guildmaster awaits you there."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Well met, adventurer. I understand you wish to learn the lancers' art under our roof."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Though you have doubtless brandished a spear before this day, and perhaps even in earnest, you still have a long way to go before you may call yourself a lancer in sooth."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"In my capacity as guildmaster, I shall guide your training, beginning with the very basics─the principles of our art."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"There exist myriad fighting styles, each of which has its own unique qualities. None, however, can claim to be as offensively minded as ours. Our approach is ever one of attack, no matter who─or what─we face."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"An experienced lancer is able to wield a polearm as if it were an extension of his body. He transforms into a raging storm before his foes, delivering a barrage of devastating thrusts and slashes."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"To facilitate such a relentless assault, we lancers forgo plate, favoring armor of leather and chain─such materials as provide adequate protection without unduly hindering movement."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"A lancer's worth may be measured quite simply─in how swiftly and decisively he can pierce his enemy's defenses."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"By its nature, the polearm is a simple weapon to wield─for good or ill. Even in a farmer's hands, it is capable of wreaking considerable havoc. Thus has it been a mainstay of every great army since ancient times."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Yet know that a lance alone does not a lancer make. Faced with unfavorable odds, an unseasoned spearman will break formation and flee without a moment's hesitation."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"A true lancer, however, flinches not before his enemies, for he knows not the meaning of fear. Ever does he press forward, disdainful of the odds, that he might pierce the enemy line and open a path to victory."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Needless to say, doing so requires no small amount of courage. And that is why our guild has striven from the first to instill this essential quality in every soul who passes through our halls."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Arduous trials await you should you join our ranks. Knowing this, have you the resolve to wield the lance?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"Have you the resolve to wield the lance?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Yes"},{"name":"A2","text":"No"},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Hah hah hah! Your honesty does you credit, adventurer."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"It takes a kind of strength to admit that something is beyond you. Should you ever muster the resolve to take up the lance, I will be here."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Well said, adventurer. I see no reason to deny you a place within our ranks."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Ah, but I neglected to introduce myself. I am Ywain, master of this guild."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Pleasantries duly exchanged, I hereby assign you your first task─a trial, to be precise."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"In order to develop an affinity with your weapon and learn to gauge such things as distance, you are to go forth and brandish your spear with reckless abandon."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"The squirrels, ladybugs, and funguars that roam just outside the city should provide you with a suitable challenge."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"Put down, let us say, three of each, and then report back to me."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"So you are back. I trust you have learned something of the essence of our art."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"A lancer learns best when he is doing, each thrust making him stronger. Such things as strategy and technique will come in time. And never forget courage─without it, you cannot hope to realize your potential."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"...Your look betrays no hint of doubt."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"I would have you take with you this hunting log. It bears the names of the creatures against which a lancer might hone his skills."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"To be sure, there is no single way to master our art. The log serves to guide you should you find yourself in need of direction."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"That will be all for the present. Now, take up your weapon, sally forth, and cut a path for yourself."},{"name":"YWAIN","text":"When next we meet, I hope to see you stronger for your time out in the world."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The next lancer quest will be available from Ywain upon reaching level 5."}],"reward":{"job":4,"items":[{"num":5,"id":4639}],"xp":100},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":1,"id":5}]},"next":[65571,65583]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000251","obj":{"i":1000251,"n":"Jillian","l":53,"q":5,"t":"Guild Receptionist"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000254","obj":{"i":1000254,"n":"Ywain","l":53,"q":13,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"item","id":"4639","obj":{"i":4639,"n":"Marmot Steak","l":5,"c":24355,"t":46,"p":9}},{"type":"quest","id":"65571","obj":{"i":65571,"n":"Courage of Stone","g":130,"l":"Gridania","s":100,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"65583","obj":{"i":65583,"n":"Spear of the Fearless","g":130,"l":"Gridania","s":50,"f":1}}]}
