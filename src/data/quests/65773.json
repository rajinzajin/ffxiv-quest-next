In order to prevent the Night of Devilry from coming to pass, you must pretend to cooperate with the twisted troupe, that you might uncover the details of their dark plot. Speak with the untrustworthy illusionist near the Aftcastle, and offer your services to him.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","The untrustworthy illusionist has entrusted you with three pumpkin lanterns, which he bids you place at three locations in Limsa Lominsa, and in the order specified. The first lantern is bound for the Drowning Wench.<br><br>※If the illusion wears off, you may receive it again by speaking with the untrustworthy illusionist.","You have convinced Baderon to let you place a pumpkin lantern inside the Drowning Wench. Now make your way to the Coral Tower, and find a likely spot for the second lantern.","With some conditions, Commodore Reyner permits you to leave the second pumpkin lantern inside the Coral Tower. The third and final lantern is earmarked for Maelstrom Command. Make your way there, and find a likely spot for it.","Though Commander R'ashaht Rhiki consents to your leaving the third pumpkin inside Maelstrom Command, she warns you that the Maelstrom will not be responsible for its care. You have now placed the three lanterns as prescribed. Return to the Aftcastle and report your success to the untrustworthy illusionist.","It appears that the untrustworthy illusionist had been plotting to summon forth a horde of dark creatures, and he would have succeeded─with your help─were it not for the unwitting intervention of the locals. For now, you are assured in the knowledge that the realm is safe. Return to Godriquelain and report all that you have seen and heard.","Though relieved for the present, Godriquelain fears that the Continental Circus may yet usher in the Night of Devilry. He bids you meet him in Ul'dah, where another dark scheme is in the offing. Make haste to the sultanate, and join Godriquelain in the vicinity of the Ruby Road Exchange.","You arrive in Ul'dah and find Godriquelain waiting at the Ruby Road Exchange. Take a deep breath and steel yourself, for the night promises to be dark and full of terrors."],"objectives":["Speak with the untrustworthy illusionist.","While transfigured, place a pumpkin lantern inside the Drowning Wench.","While transfigured, place a pumpkin lantern inside the Coral Tower.","While transfigured, place a pumpkin lantern inside Maelstrom Command.","Report to the untrustworthy illusionist.","Report to Godriquelain.","Speak with Godriquelain in Ul'dah."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GODRIQUELAIN","text":"Since arriving in Limsa Lominsa, I have conducted a preliminary investigation into Continental Circus activities."},{"name":"GODRIQUELAIN","text":"As was the case in Gridania, they are calling for unsuspecting volunteers, doubtless to help them bring their vile plot to fruition.

The premise is very original, do you not agree?"},{"name":"CONJURER65773","text":"'Tis a shame that our <span class=\"emphasis\">props</span> were removed before the play could take place.

You must tell me everything you have learned!"},{"name":"GODRIQUELAIN","text":"...A magicked pattern? By the gods, how many ways are there to usher in the Night of Devilry? And to think that you might have been party to it if not for the Lominsans' unwitting intervention!"},{"name":"GODRIQUELAIN","text":"But the danger is not passed. The illusionist bade you help out with the festivities in Ul'dah, which means that yet another scheme is in progress.

We must continue our investigation in Ul'dah. Make your way there as soon as you are able, and meet me in the vicinity of the Ruby Road Exchange.
