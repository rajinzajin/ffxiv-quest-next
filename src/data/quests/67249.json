By taking an interest in the development of the younger generation, he feels that his songs have gained in power, and believes that yours could, too. If you have a mind to rise to new heights as a bard, accept Jehantel's invitation and go to Quiver's Hold, where you will be introduced to his acquaintance.","Arriving at Quiver's Hold, you are introduced to a man named Sanson, a captain of the Order of the Twin Adder. Though he is a lancer by training, Sanson believes in the power of song, and is seeking to establish a new unit which incorporates bards. To his frustration, however, thus far the leaders of the Gods' Quiver have not been amenable to his requests for cooperation. Presently, he will meet with them again, and hopes to sway them with the existence of a legendary song said to hold the power to bring battles to a decisive end: the Ballad of Oblivion. Make your way to the Seat of the First Bow and be present for the meeting.","The meeting does not proceed as well as Sanson had hoped. The Gods' Quiver are still unwilling to lend their cooperation, though Lewin allows that he is intrigued by the Ballad of Oblivion. Sanson declares his intent to go on a journey to find this song, but even this endeavor is met with opposition. The leader of the Gold Bull unit─a man who does not think highly of bards─assigns Sanson a trial to test his fitness to embark on his proposed expedition: culling enraged treants in the East Shroud. In this manner, the meeting comes to an end. Speak with Jehantel to hear his thoughts on the trial.","Dubious as to whether the Gods' Quiver actually mean to dispatch a bard, Jehantel bids you aid Sanson in the trial. Make your way to the East Shroud and join the serpent captain at Amarissaix's Spire.","You arrive to find Sanson on his knees and surrounded by enraged treants. Vanquish the creatures and assist your companion.","You defeat the treants and help Sanson to his feet. At that moment, you are almost taken unaware by yet another creature, but before it can do you harm, a mysterious archer appears and puts it down with a barrage of arrows. Introducing himself as Guydelot, the cocksure fellow is revealed to be the bard assigned to your expedition and one of Jehantel's students. Yet in spite of Guydelot's ability, Sanson is unconvinced of his suitability, and makes his displeasure towards the man abundantly clear. Speak with Jehantel to learn what he thinks of this rocky introduction.","Jehantel does not mince words: watching over the conflict between Sanson and Guydelot will be a burden upon you. By the same token, however, he believes that the experience will help you to grow as a bard. Make your way back to Quiver's Hold and join Sanson as he reports the success of his trial.","With the trial's success, Sanson receives official permission to proceed with the expedition. So it is that your journey to find the Ballad of Oblivion begins. For the first leg, make your way to Ishgard, and rejoin your companions at the aetheryte plaza.","Upon arriving in Ishgard, Sanson declares that he will begin by making inquiries. He bids you rest and recover your strength, for it will most certainly be called upon as the journey unfolds.<br><br>※The next bard quest will be available from Sanson upon reaching level 52."],"objectives":["Speak with Jehantel at Quiver's Hold.","Speak with Jehantel at the Seat of the First Bow.","Speak with Jehantel.","Speak with Sanson at Amarissaix's Spire.","Assist Sanson.","Speak with Jehantel at Amarissaix's Spire.","Speak with Sanson at Quiver's Hold.","Speak with Sanson in Ishgard."],"dialogue":[{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Ah, my dear <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

Jehantel often speaks of you, and highly."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"And as you have heard, I seek to establish a new unit. 'Tis my belief that bards would give our forces a tactical advantage. To that end, I went to the Gods' Quiver to request their cooperation."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Alas, they were not receptive to my proposal. Many yet remain skeptical of the power of song, and would sooner spend their time bending the bow than plucking the harp. But I was not deterred."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"I scoured ancient tomes and reached out to the moogles to find decisive proof of a bard's worth in battle. And I am pleased to say that my efforts have finally yielded fruit: there exists a legendary song that is said to bring a battle to an immediate conclusion!"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"The Ballad of Oblivion, 'tis called.

As it pertains to bards, I doubt our presence would be taken amiss.

I am certain of it!"},{"name":"LEWIN","text":"I must allow, such a decisive way to end a battle does pique my interest..."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"My investigation has revealed that the song originates from the western reaches of Coerthas. It is my intent to journey there and find it."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"As a matter of fact, I have already submitted papers to the Gods' Quiver requesting a bard to accompany me on this expedition."},{"name":"SUBLEADER01713","text":"Rest assured we have already handpicked one for you. Not that there were many to choose from, mind you. Jehantel has scarcely commenced his lessons, after all."},{"name":"SUBLEADER01713","text":"Now, with times as they are, every man of us is precious. Therefore, before we commit one of ours to your cause, I would test your fitness to undertake this expedition."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"What would you have me do?"},{"name":"SUBLEADER01713","text":"Demonstrate your martial prowess─simple as that. Enraged treants have been plaguing travelers in the Twelveswood. I would have you and your companion–to–be deal with them."},{"name":"SUBLEADER01713","text":"Lest you worry, we've assigned you someone capable. I shall have him join you presently at Amarissaix's Spire, near to where said treants lurk. Good fortune to you, Captain."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"This comes as no surprise. He is among those who doubt the worth of a bard."},{"name":"LEWIN","text":"Though a trial is a mite contrived, that we have no hands to waste was no lie.

'Tis my desire that you accompany Sanson on his expedition."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"I request this of you because I know no finer bard. Furthermore, I believe that you will gain something from this experience."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"But first, there is the matter of the trial.

What is the meaning of this interference? They were in the midst of a trial, for gods' sake!"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"(-Guydelot-)Don't have a fit, old man. It isn't good for your heart. Besides, I wouldn't call it interference, seeing as I'm part of this merry band."},{"name":"PUKNOPOKI","text":"It's true, kupo! I was present when he received his orders. And I was also present when he said, “What a bloody bother! I hope they botch the trial!”"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"(-Guydelot-)Aye, well, I did say those words, I'll not deny it. But seeing <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> in action has changed my mind."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"I'm Guydelot, of the Gold Bulls. I don't care for fame and fortune, and I couldn't give two farts about this Dirge of Deathlike Doomness you're after."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"I <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span>, however, have an interest in song. I can't pass over the chance to travel with an exceptional bard like yourself. And I promise you won't be poorer for my fine company."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Well, things have certainly taken an interesting turn. Know that Guydelot is among my most promising students. I can vouch for his ability."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Ability, aye, but naught else."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"I know about you, Guydelot the Spent. Your reputation as a troublemaker precedes you. You treat authority with contempt, shirk duty at every turn, and make a general nuisance of yourself."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"That they sent the likes of you means that they <span class=\"emphasis\">want</span> me to fail! My hopes of finding the Ballad of Oblivion... All up in smoke..."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Grrr, say it straight to my face, will you? Jehantel, do we really have to travel with this pompous prat? <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and I alone will do just fine!

Who do you think is the driving force behind the expedition!?"},{"name":"SANSON","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; I suppose beggars can't be choosers. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I must return to Quiver's Hold with word of the trial's success. Please join me there."},{"name":"PUKNOPOKI","text":"I'm glad to see you again, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! You must sing for me again, and soon, kupo!"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Guydelot may have his failings, but he is not a bad fellow. Truth be told, I had intended to introduce him to you as well."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"To that end, I asked Pukno Poki to seek him out, only to have him appear as our Quiverman. Fate works in strange ways, does it not?"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"A pity he and Sanson do not see eye to eye. Their personalities are simply too far apart, and the gulf will not be easily bridged."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"Though it will be a burden upon you, in watching over these two disparate souls, doubt not but that you will grow as a bard."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"But come, let us hurry back to Gridania. 'Tis too early still to leave those two unchaperoned."},{"name":"PUKNOPOKI","text":"The air is taut as a tightly wound harp, kupo..."},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"They may have gotten off on the wrong foot, but these two have proven their readiness for the expedition."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"That Sanson hasn't shut up since he got here.

Well, well..."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"We have done as bade and culled the enraged treants. I trust you have no objections to the expedition."},{"name":"SUBLEADER01713","text":"None whatsoever. Nor do I have any doubt that Guydelot shall be of great help to you. I shall look forward to good tidings in the days to come."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"Of great help indeed..."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"At any rate, 'tis now official─we may proceed with the expedition. Let us depart for the Holy See at once. Lest you wonder, I have already secured us passage into Ishgardian territory."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"At any rate, 'tis now official─we may proceed with the expedition.

Safe travels, my friend. I shall await your return, all the while looking forward to hearing such songs as are born of your experience."},{"name":"PUKNOPOKI","text":"It'll be a grueling journey, but so long as you work together, you're bound to succeed, kupo!"},{"name":"JEHANTEL","text":"So it is to Ishgard, then.

For all this open sky, it feels gloomier than the closeness of the Twelveswood."},{"name":"SANSON","text":"First, I shall make inquiries here in Ishgard. As for you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, pray rest and recover your strength. We will likely have need of it on the road."},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Godsdammit, man! Here we are in a new place, one that hasn't been open to visitors for over a decade, and you've got your nose buried in a bloody book!"},{"name":"GUYDELOT","text":"Take a moment to get a feel for the city, I say!
