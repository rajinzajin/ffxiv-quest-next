But don't worry─I'm not going to do anything like that today! Today, I'm going to tell you a story. A story of moss fungus, and of children."},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Moss fungus often grows on graves, and because of this, Kholusians believe it to be a most baleful thing, and a harbinger of death, disease, and all sort of other nasty things. Because of this, many children have nightmares of being chased after by giant moss funguses! Is it moss funguses?"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Anyhow, this got me thinking. Wouldn't it be <span class=\"emphasis\">so</span> sweet if <span class=\"emphasis\">someone</span> put these poor dreamers' hearts at ease by bringing me the cap of a slain moss fungus, that I could spin it into a dream to show the children that there's nothing to fear about these funny-looking creatures?"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"I'm not asking you to do this. Heavens no! I'm merely saying that <span class=\"emphasis\">if</span> someone were inclined to perform this kind gesture, all they would need to do is take an oh-so-short trip to Sextuplet Shallow and rip the cap off one of the unsuspecting moss funguseses that live there. Don't worry, though─I'm sure my dreamers won't mind living in abject fear for another day or two."},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Hm? You have something for me? But I didn't even ask you for anything!"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"The cap of a moss fungus! However did you know that I was looking for one of these? It's almost as if you had the power to enter <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> mind! But whatever can I do to reward your selfless and entirely self-motivated gesture?"},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"I know, I'll tell you another story about moss fungus! Once upon a time in a mortal kingdom that is no more, people would sometimes play little tricks on those they didn't like by sneaking a teensy-weensy bit of moss fungus poison into their drinks every day."},{"name":"UINNEE","text":"Guess what would happen then? The poor person would gradually grow sick and eventually die, and nobody would be the wiser! That's quite the trick, don't you think? Why, I wish I'd thought of it myself! By the way, can I interest you in a sip of water before you go? Tee hee!"}],"reward":{"gil":606,"reputation":60,"items":[{"num":15,"id":28},{"id":28186}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":4,"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":34}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1031809","obj":{"i":1031809,"n":"Uin Nee","l":2956,"q":28}},{"type":"item","id":"28","obj":{"i":28,"n":"Allagan Tomestone of Poetics","l":1,"c":65023,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"28186","obj":{"i":28186,"n":"Fae Fancy","l":1,"c":65074,"t":100}}]}
