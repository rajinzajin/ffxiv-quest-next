He hands you a piece of parchment detailing the first tale he suggests you investigate, taking care to mention that the Congregation priest emphasized these stories can rarely be taken at face value. You set off to relay this information to Heustienne and Orn Khai.","The legend Ser Alberic has dug up concerns the Slumbering Wyrm of Gyr Abania. Orn Khai is initially distracted upon seeing the parchment, as dragons do not have a written language; they pass down their history through song, which is how he knows the name of his father's consort: Faunehm. Heustienne asks you to accompany Orn Khai to the Fringes to learn more about the Slumbering Wyrm.","The impatient young dragon rushes into the temple without you, and judging by his cries for help, he regrets having done so.","Orn Khai's assailant bested, you resume your search for the dragon of legend. Just as the youthful Dravanian is wondering whether or not the creature you encountered was the Slumbering Wyrm itself, a rather scholarly looking gentleman appears.","The gentleman turns out to be one Professor Erik, and he too has an interest in the legend of the Slumbering Wyrm. He goes on to give you a lecture on the subject─the only noteworthy part of which being that the Slumbering Wyrm was actually a high priest, who passed away over three hundred years prior. Orn Khai soon grows tired of Erik's musings and suggests you head to Coerthas to speak with Ser Alberic. ","Ser Alberic apologizes for sending you on a wild goose chase of sorts, but is quick to note that he has another legend you may wish to explore. This one's roots lie far to the east, Ser Alberic remarking that Orn Khai may struggle to make the journey with you due to his modestly sized wings. Orn Khai is, however, undeterred and convinces Ser Alberic to come up with a way to allow him to make the crossing to Kugane.<br><br>※The next dragoon quest will be available from Ser Alberic upon reaching level 65."],"objectives":["Present the Dravanian legend to Heustienne at Mare's Oath.","Summon Orn Khai.","Slay the enemy.","Speak with Orn Khai.","Speak with Alberic."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"See if Ser Alberic knows aught of Dravanian legends concerning the east. Pray report back to me once you have learned something pertinent."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"Father often remarked that you would have made a fine Dravanian!"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, just the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> I wished to see. We finished examining the Dravanian legends known to us but a short while ago."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"However, the priest bade me make it clear to you that these kinds of legends are oft told in increasingly...<span class=\"emphasis\">colorful</span> ways as the years go on."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Quite common it is for a mere scalekin or puk to, with the Keeper's help, transform into a fearsome dragon. I suppose it should come as little surprise. Legends gain fame by capturing the imagination of the masses; it would not do for an unadorned winged lizard to be the protagonist."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"But let us put the issue of authenticity to one side for a moment. I have summarized the first tale which seemed most relevant on this piece of parchment; pray put it to use in your search. Oh, and lastly, tell Heustienne that she is ever in my thoughts."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Never before have I looked into Dravanian legends with any purpose other than hunting a dragon in mind. Mayhap this is a glimpse of the dragoon's future role in this realm."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Would that parchment happen to be for mine eyes?"},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Ah yes, I would never forget Ser Alberic's exquisite handwriting. This information shall be of great use, I am sure. Let us see, it seems he thinks we ought to commence our search with the Slumbering Wyrm of Gyr Abania."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"This is my first time seeing these patterns that men use. Fascinating indeed that you can share information in such a manner."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"Dravanian history is chronicled not with letters, but through song. These verses have taught me much about Faunehm─my father's consort."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Faunehm, you say? Well, knowing her name can only aid the search. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, pray accompany Orn Khai to the ruins of the Fist of Rhalgr temple in the Fringes."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Ser Alberic states that this is where the origins of the Slumbering Wyrm lie."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"The journey ahead is long, and it will benefit us not to delay our departure any longer. Whistle for me when you have reached our destination and I shall come to your side."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Mayhap I too could learn from Orn Khai's devotion to his father. I have given mine own more cause to worry than I would like to admit."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"It would seem man is capable of using lots of styles when creating buildings. I had been expecting something similar to those found in the Churning Mists."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"Let us venture inside and see if Faunehm cannot be found."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"Your help, if you please!"},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"I know not what it is we are dealing with, but I would be grateful if you could slay it!"},{"name":"POPMESSAGE","text":"You are under attack!"},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"I had been admiring the craftsmanship of man when it suddenly moved towards me. Though I struggle to believe this is what the legends refer to as the Slumbering Wyrm..."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"Ah, dear <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I did not know you <span class=\"emphasis\">too</span> were researching the Slumbering Wyrm!"},{"name":"ERIK","text":"Researching the Slumbering Wyrm, are we? It is always nice to see others take up an interest in history─even if it is entirely shallow."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"W-Wait, you know of the Slumbering Wyrm? We have journeyed here for the very purpose of meeting that dragon!"},{"name":"ERIK","text":"Hahahaha! You Dravanians could do with studying up on your history. The time when one could meet the Wyrm has long since passed!"},{"name":"ERIK","text":"The high priest Heimart, also known as the Slumbering Wyrm, departed this world over three hundred years ago!"},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"The Slumbering Wyrm was a mere man!?"},{"name":"ERIK","text":"But of course! Why would you think otherwise? Heimart was a monk renowned for his mastery of meditation. Though, when necessary, he was quite capable of harnessing his wyrm-like strength to trounce his foes."},{"name":"ERIK","text":"He earned the Slumbering Wyrm alias after...&lt;babble&gt;...hundred men...&lt;babble&gt;...However...&lt;babble&gt;...fell asleep...&lt;babble&gt;"},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"Well, it seems we must begin our search anew. I worry I too may become a slumbering wyrm should I listen to this tiring man any longer. Let us pay a visit to Ser Alberic instead. Anyone Heustienne holds in such high regard can surely aid our hunt."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"I am relieved we were not alone in failing to consider the possibility of a non-Dravanian Slumbering Wyrm..."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Good evening</span><span class=\"alternative\">Good morning</span><span class=\"alternative\">Good day</span></span>, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Our friend here has informed me as to the truth behind the legend. My apologies for not looking deeper into the story before bringing it to your attention."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Your next destination lies in the Far East. Tell me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, have you set foot in the region before?"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"A port city called Kugane? Sounds positively fascinating. I imagine 'twould be a fine place to begin looking into this next legend. Regrettably, I should not think Orn Khai will be able to accompany you on this journey."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Truly, you have never made the journey? You are so well traveled I assumed you must have visited the city. Well, you shall need to head there if you wish to continue your search. Regrettably, I should not think Orn Khai will be able to accompany you this time."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"But how do you expect to find Faunehm without a dragon in tow?"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Your plight is well understood, Orn Khai. It is truly a shame your wings do not match your ambition."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Though...mayhap I have not fully considered all options available to us. We do owe you a great debt for all you have done for Heustienne. Allow me some time, and I shall see to it you are able to follow <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> to the Far East."},{"name":"ORNKHAI","text":"You have my thanks, Ser Alberic! Oh, I wish I could set off this very moment! Perhaps a spot of hunting would be enough to calm me down... Pray call me when preparations are complete!"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"At the very least, we now know that Heustienne will not have wanted for company since leaving Ishgard. Sadly, I may struggle to secure passage to the East in quite as timely a manner as he would like. Pray keep your lance arm honed; there is no knowing just what you shall face in Othard."}],"reward":{"gil":2476,"xp":191700},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":63,"id":23}],"quests":[68446]},"next":[68448]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006748","obj":{"i":1006748,"n":"Alberic","l":63,"q":17}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022543","obj":{"i":1022543,"n":"Heustienne","l":2000,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022544","obj":{"i":1022544,"n":"Orn Khai","l":2000,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022547","obj":{"i":1022547,"n":"Orn Khai","l":2406,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022549","obj":{"i":1022549,"n":"Orn Khai","l":63,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68446","obj":{"i":68446,"n":"Friends through Eternity","g":150,"l":"Coerthas Central Highlands","s":601,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68448","obj":{"i":68448,"n":"Serpent and the Sea of Rubies","g":150,"l":"Coerthas Central Highlands","s":650,"f":1}}]}
