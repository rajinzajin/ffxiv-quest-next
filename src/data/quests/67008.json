Make your way to the airship landing in Ul'dah, where Advisor Colson will be awaiting your arrival.","Advisor Colson has identified the airship piloted by the kidnapper as the property of the Laughing Alchemists, a disreputable trading company operating out of Ul'dah. As you converse, you overhear three Brass Blades discuss their attempt to capture a fugitive beastman wreaking havoc in the streets. Could this be related to the kidnappings you are investigating? Seek out the beastman in question and find out.","The fugitive beastman was revealed to be your erstwhile comrade, Yadovv Gah of the Brotherhood of Ash. He swears that the rumors of violent attacks against innocent Ul'dahns are lies, and that he came to the city in pursuit of a man who abducted his brothers. Sylvie appears, offering to lead the troubled Amalj'aa safely out of the city walls. Before departing, Yadovv Gah informs you that he and his warleader will await you at the Ring of Ash.","Though Hamujj Gah welcomes your return to the Ring of Ash, he seethes with anger at the abduction of his fellow Amalj'aa by the hand of the ubiquitous kidnapper. The warleader's honor will not allow him to sit idly by. Realizing that the two of you share a common foe, he enlists your aid in seeing that the perpetrator answers for his treacherous acts."],"objectives":["Speak with Colson at the airship landing in Ul'dah.","Search for the escaped beastman in the streets of Ul'dah.","Reunite with Hamujj Gah at the Ring of Ash."],"dialogue":[{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"That this kidnapper you pursue pilots his own personal airship─and a Garlond Ironworks 1569-II, at that─is fascinating...and more than a bit frightening."},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"It hardly needs be said that such a vessel would be beyond the purchasing power of all but the wealthiest Eorzeans. Your quarry─or whoever is paying for his services─likely has nigh-limitless riches at his disposal."},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"But have faith, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Some of the most capable men in the employ of Highwind Skyways are tracking the rogue vessel as we speak. Whoever is behind these abductions, his identity will not remain secret much longer."},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"I have arranged for Advisor Colson to meet you at the airship landing in Ul'dah. Whatever knowledge my colleagues have gleaned in the meantime, it will be yours."},{"name":"TATARAMU","text":"Your foe is backed by the power of coin, but you have something much stronger on your side─the power of justice!

Master Tataramu told me you would be coming."},{"name":"COLSON","text":"I am pleased to inform you that we were able to retrieve the records requested by the young master with a minimum of trouble. I have taken the liberty of compiling the relevant findings."},{"name":"COLSON","text":"...Ahem. Yes, the Garlond Ironworks Model 1569-II. According to the records, only four were ever produced. A shame, really...it was a marvel of airship design. Unfortunately, unrelenting attacks from Garlean forces that year made for less-than-ideal manufacturing conditions."},{"name":"COLSON","text":"But I digress. At the time, two of the vessels were purchased by the sultanate, while the other two entered Highwind Skyways' own fleet. Of our two vessels, one remains in operation to this day, but the other... This is where the records take an odd turn."},{"name":"COLSON","text":"The records claim that it was decommissioned after suffering extensive damages, then sold off to a trading company known as the “Laughing Alchemists.”"},{"name":"COLSON","text":"As the ship was heavily damaged, it was sold under the condition that it would be stripped for parts. Yet this was but a verbal agreement─we have no proof that the Laughing Alchemists carried out their end of the bargain."},{"name":"COLSON","text":"Ahem... “Service with a smile, and prices so low the Traders will be laughing Their heads off! Seek out the Laughing Alchemists for a <span class=\"emphasis\">hilariously</span> good deal!” ...Such are their words.

Venture outside at your own peril!"},{"name":"COLSON","text":"A beastman rampaging unchecked within the city walls? That is a frightful prospect indeed."},{"name":"COLSON","text":"In any event, I have shared all that I have to share, and should be returning to my duties. Pray give the young master my regards, and tell him I would be most interested in having a look at that new airship of yours."},{"name":"DOUZINDAND01472","text":"The fugitive was last sighted fleeing down Emerald Avenue.

It is I─your brother and comrade-in-arms, Yadovv Gah!"},{"name":"YADOVVGAH","text":"(-Yadovv Gah-)I can see the doubt in your eyes. You wonder what brings me so far from the Ring of Ash. I can assure you that I meant no harm to your kind, this I swear!"},{"name":"YADOVVGAH","text":"(-Yadovv Gah-)Far from it. No, it is my own brothers that are in danger. Mere hatchlings, stolen from us by a faceless foe. A sniveling cur too cowardly to meet us on the field of battle!"},{"name":"YADOVVGAH","text":"(-Yadovv Gah-)I pursued him here to Ul'dah, and this was my mistake. No sooner did I arrive than did they call me fugitive, criminal, or worse. They claim I visit violence on innocents, when in truth I have not hurt a flea!"},{"name":"YADOVVGAH","text":"(-Yadovv Gah-)But they will not listen to reason, and I have no means of escape! Gah!

You return to the Ring of Ash from afar, and we are stronger for your presence."},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"I have heard from Yadovv Gah how you and your friend saved his life in Ul'dah. I fear that the fault in sending him to such unwelcoming environs was my own. The Brotherhood is in your debt once more."},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"When the threat of our mortal foe, the Flamefangs, was quenched by your hand, Zanr'ak regained a measure of peace. And yet I fear that these halcyon days were short-lived."},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"Not days ago, an uninvited guest came to the Ring of Ash from the skies, bearing a fearsome blade and ill intentions. Fighting with a fury that belied his slight frame, he quickly subdued the strongest of our kin and absconded with a bevy of hatchlings."},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"The shame! The dishonor! Have the proud Amalj'aa fallen so far that they allow their young to be stolen from them like a sack of popotoes!?"},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"My kin are shocked and shamed by this loss, but we are still Amalj'aa! Unlike Ifrit's addled slaves, we have not forgotten how to fight for ourselves; the Brotherhood of Ash are warriors, and warriors do not abandon their sons."},{"name":"HAMUJIGAH","text":"Yadovv Gah tells me that you, too, pursue this same man. Join us in battle once more, honored ally, that the craven whelp will answer for his dishonorable acts, and feel the rage of a thousand fists crushing his bones into dust!"},{"name":"YADOVVGAH","text":"The Brotherhood of Ash welcomes your return, honored ally. Doubtless there are many stirring tales of battle we could trade, but such revelry will have to wait for another day.
