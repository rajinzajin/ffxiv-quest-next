You can only hope that his promises of newfound performance and fashion have merit.","You have conveyed the bag and Wiscard's well-wishes to Rowena, with explosive results. Try to think happy thoughts as you hasten back to the flamboyant trader.","Wiscard practically writhes in ecstasy at Rowena's loathing, proving that one truly does create one's own reality. He presents you with a glamour prism, which has the power to make one object look like another. Now you, too, can look the part of a successful adventurer!"],"objectives":["Deliver the leather bag to Rowena.","Speak with Wiscard."],"dialogue":[{"name":"WISCARD","text":"Let me tell you about Wiscard! Who is he? He is the first of a new breed, a category-defying adventuring trader. Think: derring–do and can–do cross-pollinating like...giant bees. A trading adventurer, he is."},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"Now, allow me to segue into the first person so we can get down to business. And that business is...you! And <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">sister</span><span class=\"alternative\">brother</span></span> adventurer, are not looking so good."},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"In fact, it hurts the entire adventurer brand to have you walking about looking the way you do. Oh, your equipment may be of good quality, but people expect flash! Romance! Sure, you might provide results, but check the trends, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span>─that doesn't sell!"},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"Now, I can help you. In fact, I'm probably the only person who can. For just a small service rendered, I can show you how to perform better, and─even more importantly─<span class=\"emphasis\">look</span> better!"},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"So, does that sound like a path you might want to take? Of course it does, you're a keen sort of <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">fellow</span></span>. You can start by taking this leather bag to Rowena! Make sure to tell her it's from Wiscard...with <span class=\"emphasis\">much</span> fondness. &lt;wink&gt;"},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"What's that? You find your conversation skills lacking? Hah, nonsense! I could tell immediately you're special. Let me guess: felt like the odd one out as a youngling, right? When you get back, you're going to tell me all about it!"},{"name":"ROWENA","text":"Hm? Somethin' from ol' Wiscard? And he <span class=\"emphasis\">winked</span> at you, too? Gods, this should be rich. Well, let's have it, then."},{"name":"ROWENA","text":"...A leather bag? I was right: this <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> rich. That stinkin' sack o' goobbue shite! You know what he sent?"},{"name":"ROWENA","text":"It's what he owes me...for <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> last moon. He wheedles and whines all the long day, but when it comes to actually gettin' somethin' out o' him, it's like pullin' out coeurls' teeth."},{"name":"ROWENA","text":"You tell him I got a cure for what ails him! Absence makes the heart grow fonder, they say. Well, I'll do him the favor o' seein' him sooner, all right: tell him this month's payment's due a week early!"},{"name":"ROWENA","text":"And a bit of advice for <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>, messenger <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">girl</span><span class=\"alternative\">boy</span></span>: don't you be taken in by his peacockin'."},{"name":"ROWENA","text":"All his finery's just so much flimflam.

Naught but a jewel–studded turd, you mark my words!"},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"No, no, don't say a word, that was...<span class=\"emphasis\">amazing</span>! Wiscard saw it all, heard it all!"},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"Ah, the unbridled hostility! Now <span class=\"emphasis\">there's</span> a woman who understands how to stimulate latent potential! She lashes me with contempt while grinding a boot heel into my impudence─a mistress most cruel, the Halone of my fever dreams..."},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"But enough about me─let's talk about you. Are you ready to perform better...<span class=\"emphasis\">and</span> look better? Are you prepared to meet the new you, not tomorrow, but today?"},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"With a glamour prism, you can project the likeness of one object on another. A little practical magic, and the world sees you as you should be seen─in a better light!"},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"Now, I know what you're thinking: shouldn't people respect you for who you are? Or, wouldn't they anyway, once they knew you? And I say: good luck! Who's going to want to take the time, <span class=\"emphasis\">unless</span> you give them a reason to?"},{"name":"WISCARD","text":"But don't take my word for it!
