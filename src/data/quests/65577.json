Return them to Samiane and set her mind at ease.","Samiane thanks you for your assistance in collecting the Azeyma rose hips. Though some seeds may have sprouted where they fell, she explains that all botanists consider it their responsibility to raise the Twelveswood's flora in the best possible conditions.
