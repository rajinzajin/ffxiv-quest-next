Before setting out on this most essential of tasks, however, he bids you join him in speaking with Thinkingway to learn what materials want for gathering.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","According to Thinkingway, Buildingway is in need of crystals, a requirement Dreamingway seems especially familiar with. Dreamingway asks you to meet him in Vallis Vulneris, rushing ahead to find a suitable deposit of crystals to mine.","By the time you arrive, Dreamingway has already finished mining all the crystals he requires. But as luck would have it, he recalls something else Buildingway recently asked for─grey sand. How fortuitous that the surrounding area is filled with it.","The sand is coarse, rough, and irritating, and it made its way everywhere. Nevertheless, you gathered an ample store. Dreamingway is certain to be pleased with your contribution.","As it transpires, Dreamingway is indeed more excited to receive a pile of sand than anyone should be. Perhaps you should be thankful that he didn't ask for more.","When you make your delivery, Thinkingway shows themself to be somewhat perplexed as to how Dreamingway knew that Buildingway needed sand, but thanks you both for your hard work regardless. This brief stint in the life of Dreamingway failed to offer ideas for a dream to pursue, but your Loporrit companion is not deterred. He has more to show you, and is confident inspiration is forthcoming."],"objectives":["Speak with Thinkingway.","Speak with Dreamingway.","Obtain grey sand.","Deliver the grey sand to Dreamingway.","Report to Thinkingway."],"dialogue":[{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"My warmest and fuzziest thanks for your continued help, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I was thinking─if the other Loporrits can't tell you what I might be best at, perhaps you could follow me around and see for yourself."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"My primary work includes gathering materials, equipment maintenance, and─most importantly─carrot production! All indispensable to our day-to-day operations, as I'm sure you agree."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"As for what to show you... Perhaps a spot of foraging? Everyone likes a good forage!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"We'll need to go and see Thinkingway in Greatest Endsvale first─they're the Loporrit who allocates this sort of work. I'd hate to step on any toes!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Thinkingway always has some manner of vegetable, mineral, or ooze of indeterminate origin in need of gathering..."},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"Might I assist you with something?"},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"I see you have a rather special companion today, Dreamingway. What's the occasion?"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Oh, nothing of import! <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span>'s simply here to observe me as I go about my day. Speaking of which...are there any tasks in need of doing?"},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"As a matter of fact, there are! Buildingway is in need of more crystals. Could you perchance mine some?"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"But of course! I suppose he'll want the usual assortment."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Right, then! It's off to Vallis Vulneris. I'll go on ahead and look for a suitable deposit of crystals."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Aha! You found me!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Truth be told, while I was waiting I felt an itch to get started, and, er... Before I knew it, I had gathered all the crystals Buildingway will need!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"I have a feeling he could use some sand as well, though, so why not collect it while we're here? I'm sure one bit of grey sand looks much like the rest to you, but trust me─the grey sand here is the <span class=\"emphasis\">best</span>."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"It's simple enough work, so would you care to join me?"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Splendid! I'll let you have the deposits right outside the grot─those are always so delightfully gritty. Return here when you've filled a bag or two!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"If you get confused, just think, “Is it grey? Is it sand?” That will carry you through!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"How was the sand?"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Lovely as ever! Buildingway will be delighted."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"We should make our delivery to Thinkingway as soon as possible. Last one there's a moldy carrot!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Reporting in is an important part of my duties. You should try it!"},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"Ah, that was efficient. Did you manage to procure what I asked for?"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"And more! I thought that Buildingway might want some of that oh-so-sandy Vallis Vulneris sand, so we went ahead and gathered that too."},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"Now that you mention it, he did ask me to procure some grey sand... Heavens, it would have been embarrassing if I turned up without a grain!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Do you remember what he needed it for?"},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"I vaguely recall mention of a pit full of the stuff... Apparently the children of Etheirys enjoy such things."},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"I'm more curious about how <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> were aware of this request. Buildingway said he hadn't told anyone but me about his latest project."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Well...I must have overheard you two talking when I was out collecting crystals last time."},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"Given how far the grot is from here, that seems incredibly unlikely..."},{"name":"THINKINGWAY","text":"But never mind that. You brought the sand, and for that I'm most grateful."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"See what I mean? That's some good sand!"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Ahem. Now, while enjoying this tiny glimpse of my day-to-day life, did you find any dreams I might be capable of aspiring to?"},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"Oh, don't worry if you haven't! We've only just begun, after all."},{"name":"DREAMINGWAY","text":"I really must learn to be patient. Surely the right inspiration is out there, just waiting to strike!"}],"reward":{"gil":935,"items":[{"id":35695}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[70052]},"next":[70054]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1041556","obj":{"i":1041556,"n":"Dreamingway","l":3711,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1041557","obj":{"i":1041557,"n":"Thinkingway","l":3711,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"35695","obj":{"i":35695,"n":"Phrygian Ring Coffer (IL 533)","l":1,"c":26567,"t":61}},{"type":"quest","id":"70052","obj":{"i":70052,"n":"Name That Way","g":124,"l":"Mare Lamentorum","s":1951,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"70054","obj":{"i":70054,"n":"One Way or Another","g":124,"l":"Mare Lamentorum","s":1953,"f":1}}]}
