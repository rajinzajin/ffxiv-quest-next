In their present condition, I fear these uniforms and helms are like to draw suspicion."},{"name":"SARKMALARK","text":"They must be repaired, if only superficially. Fortunately, I have some skilled artisans among my acquaintances."},{"name":"SARKMALARK","text":"Please take the uniforms to the Weavers' Guild in Ul'dah, and the helms to the Armorers' Guild in Limsa Lominsa."},{"name":"SARKMALARK","text":"I will send word so that both places know to expect you.

I was instructed to prioritize swiftness, and so I did. While I can't vouch for the protective capacity of the garments, they certainly look the part, even if I do say so myself."},{"name":"AETHELWINE","text":"Payment? Never you mind that─sending my regards to my lord Sark Malark will be payment enough."},{"name":"HNAANZA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span>. I have been expecting you.

Having achieved thus, he turned his attention towards his true passion─adventuring─and left the management of his fortune to trusted aides."},{"name":"HNAANZA","text":"The helms are ready. With a little more time, I could have achieved a far higher quality finish, but I was given to understand that you are in some haste.

Do pass along my regards when next you see him."},{"name":"SARKMALARK","text":"Have you had the uniforms and helms repaired?"},{"name":"SARKMALARK","text":"Yes, these will serve beautifully.

In turn, these conscripted forces are sent to subjugate faraway lands. In this way, Garlemald nips rebellion in the bud and expands its territory in one fell stroke."},{"name":"SARKMALARK","text":"With that, my part in your mission is done. I am full glad to have been of assistance to your cause."},{"name":"SARKMALARK","text":"...Hm? Why would I, a wealthy merchant, wish to help you?
