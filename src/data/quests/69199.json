He heartily invites you to take part in the revelry yourself, which you may do simply by making your way to the seaside resort and speaking with Grand Chaperone Haermaga.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","Haermaga, grand chaperone of the Moonfire Faire, welcomes you to this year's festivities, and gives you a summary of all the activities available to faire-goers. The centerpiece is a trumped-up version of the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course, which is complemented by two events of smaller scale, the Iron Culinarian Challenge and the Angling Extravaganza. He follows up his explanation with a request of a more specific nature, asking if you would be willing to provide some veteran guidance to a newly recruited adventurer who Haermaga suspects might be in over his head. Should you be willing to take on the job, speak to the grand chaperone whenever you are ready.","The adventurer in question is none other than one R'Fhul Tia, an ambitious youth who makes up for what he lacks in experience with what seems to be a limitless store of unfounded confidence. No sooner has the lad introduced himself than does he challenge you to a battle to see which of you can accumulate four Faire vouchers in the fastest time. At Haermaga's behest, you accept his terms, in the hopes that you might impart to the boy a lesson or two along the way."],"objectives":["Speak with Haermaga at Costa del Sol.","Speak with Haermaga again."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MAYARUMOYARU","text":"Greetings, adventurer! Are you feeling the heat? Because <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> certainly─ Hey! I know you! Thank you ever so much for joining us for another Moonfire Faire! The festivities really wouldn't be the same without you."},{"name":"MAYARUMOYARU","text":"Greetings, adventurer! Looking for a way to beat the heat? Well, you're in luck! The annual observance of the Moonfire Faire is going on even as we speak!"},{"name":"MAYARUMOYARU","text":"Once upon a time─well, just a couple of years ago, in fact─the Moonfire Faire was a time when adventurers would band together to banish the threat of firesome fiery creatures called Bombards."},{"name":"MAYARUMOYARU","text":"Now the Bombards are long since gone─at least we hope they are─but the tradition continues as a way to celebrate the daring exploits of adventurers the realm over, and through this, recruit some fresh blood for the realm's Adventurers' Guilds in the process. A worthy cause, I'm sure you'll agree!"},{"name":"MAYARUMOYARU","text":"But enough with the chitter-chatter─I'm sure you're eager to join the celebrations yourself, yes? Then you need only make your way to the Isle of Endless Summer at Costa del Sol and speak with our grand chaperone, Haermaga! I promise he'll be overjoyed to see you!"},{"name":"MAYARUMOYARU","text":"Greetings, friend, and a happy Moonfire Faire to you! If you're keen to join in the festivities─and who isn't, really─I encourage you to visit the Isle of Endless Summer at Costa del Sol and speak with our very own Grand Chaperone Haermaga!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Well, if it isn't <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I was wondering when you'd show up! Why, you're such a mainstay around these parts each year that I felt terrible getting the festivities started without you. Anyhow, since you're here, I take it you're ready for another rousing Moonfire Faire?"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"The highlight of this year's event is: you guessed it! The return of that time-honored test of agility and acrobatic aptitude known as the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course! And lest you think that you've seen this all before, let me be the first to say that the course has come back better than ever!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Yes, Master Gegeruju has spared no effort in providing the ultimate challenge for high-flying adventurers! Word has it he even solicited opinions from the lovely ladies in his employ. “Gahahaha! Those kittens have claws, eh?”─or so I overheard him saying."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"But there's more to an adventurer's skill set than performing death-defying feats. That's why we're offering two other events─the Iron Culinarian Challenge and the Angling Extravaganza─for those looking to celebrate the season in a more relaxed and reflective manner."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Well, what have we here? We've only just met, but that spark in your eyes tells me everything. You've come to take part in the festivities, and make this year's faire the most rousing incarnation of the event our realm has ever seen! Am I right? Of course I am!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"First, allow me to introduce the highlight of the event: the time-honored test of agility and acrobatic aptitude known as the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Master Gegeruju has spared no effort in providing the ultimate challenge for high-flying adventurers. “Will they navigate these perilous paths with grace and poise, or suffer a humiliating fall? My lovely ladies can't wait to see! Gwahahahaha!”─or so I overheard him saying."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"But there's more to an adventurer's skill set than performing death-defying feats. That's why we're offering two other events─the Iron Culinarian Challenge and the Angling Extravaganza─for those looking to celebrate the season in a more relaxed and reflective manner."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Emerge triumphant in any of these events, and you'll be rewarded for your efforts with a Faire voucher. Collect enough vouchers, and you'll be able to exchange them for any of a host of spectacular seasonal rewards!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"There's also, ah, just one little thing I was hoping to ask of you. There's this adventurer, see, who just signed up at the guild, and we can't help but feel he's in need of some, ah...veteran guidance and direction. We figure you'd be perfect for the job...if it's not too much trouble, of course?"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Wonderful! I can't thank you enough. Whenever you're ready, just say the word, and we'll send for him straightaway!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Thank you ever so much, friend! I'm sure you'll be a wonderful influence on the lad. Give me just one moment...I'll summon him here."},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, is it truly you!?"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"Why, it's me! Your dear friend and companion R'fhul Tia! We braved the Eorzean Nimble Warrior course together on that memorable day, forming bonds of trust and friendship sure to last a lifetime!"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"I'm so glad you came! I have incredible news, and I can think of no one I'd rather share it with. Brace yourself, friend: the mild-mannered boy you knew then is now a gods-honest adventurer! Can you believe it?"},{"name":"RMAJHA","text":"Hi there, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">Mister</span></span> Adventurer! It's so nice to see you again!"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"(-Amateur Adventurer-)Could it truly be!? Oh, but it is! Yes, I know you! You're that adventurer that everyone at the guild told me about!"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"It's truly an honor and a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm R'fhul Tia, and I'm an adventurer, too! As of the other day, at least. I'm still quite new to this, you see. Nevertheless, I simply <span class=\"emphasis\">had</span> to meet you in the flesh!"},{"name":"RMAJHA","text":"Hi, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">Mister</span></span> Adventurer! I'm R'majha, and I'm, uh...not an adventurer. I just came to play with my big brother! Will you play with me, too?"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"So, ah, R'fhul Tia here just signed up at the Adventurers' Guild just last week. Typically, he'd be out honing his skills in hopes of becoming a full-fledged adventurer, but today he's come home to visit his dear little sister for the Moonfire Faire season. That's nice of him, I suppose?"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"There's no “hope” about it, my good man! Let me assure you I <span class=\"emphasis\">am</span> fully fledged, and then some. Why, just the other day I slew ten fearsome ladybugs in one fell swoop! Guildmaster Ywain of Gridania even told me I had “great potential!”"},{"name":"RMAJHA","text":"Wow, Fhul! You really <span class=\"emphasis\">are</span> the bestest adventurer in the whole world!"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"Haha! Would you expect anything less from your big brother? Okay, Majha, it's time to take out your hello stone!"},{"name":"RMAJHA","text":"Hello, hello! Can you hear me, Fhul? Go give those nasty monsters a good beating for me! And try not to get yourself hurt, okay?"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"Hello, hello! Worry not, little girl! Fhul the Fearless will see that these horrible fiends bother the good people of this town no more!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Er, I understand that you're probably thrilled to have your very own linkpearl, but you really should save that sort of thing for, ah, more essential situations? I mean, it's sweet that you get along and all, but..."},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Anyhow! While there might not be any <span class=\"emphasis\">monsters</span> around here, as such, I daresay that your sister had some good advice for you. Seeing as how you're still new to this adventuring business, you really should take care of yourself. After all, it's like they say: overconfidence can lead to, ah, all sorts of not-so-good things!"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Over</span>confidence? Perish the thought! I have precisely the right measure of confidence to match my rapidly burgeoning abilities. Abilities that I intend to put on full display for <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> here."},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"And with that, I stake my claim. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I hereby challenge you to battle!"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"Not a duel to the death or anything so painful, of course. Our battlefield shall be these very fairegrounds. The first to earn four Faire vouchers will be the victor─and to the victor will go the honor, and the spoils!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Oh dear. Let it never be said that you lack a sense for the dramatic. Well, what do you say, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? If you'll be participating in the festivities anyway, would you be so kind as to accept the lad's challenge?"},{"name":"RFHULTIA","text":"Haha! I knew you wouldn't back down! But be forewarned, my friend: you'd do well not to underestimate your opponent today. And with that, let the games begin!"},{"name":"RMAJHA","text":"W-Wait for me! Fhul!"},{"name":"HAERMAGA","text":"Oh dear. Say what you wish about the boy, he certainly doesn't want for enthusiasm, does he? So, ah, anyway. If you're looking to get started, I'd be more than happy to explain the rules for this year's festivities. Just come and speak with me whenever you're ready!"}],"reward":{"gil":583},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":30,"id":1}]},"next":[69200,69201,69202,69203]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1031437","obj":{"i":1031437,"n":"Mayaru Moyaru","l":28,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1031438","obj":{"i":1031438,"n":"Haermaga","l":32,"q":2}},{"type":"quest","id":"69200","obj":{"i":69200,"n":"Anything You Can Do","g":201,"l":"Eastern La Noscea","s":175}},{"type":"quest","id":"69201","obj":{"i":69201,"n":"High-flying Hijinks","g":201,"l":"Eastern La Noscea","s":176,"r":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69202","obj":{"i":69202,"n":"Frying for Fame and Fortune","g":201,"l":"Eastern La Noscea","s":177,"r":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69203","obj":{"i":69203,"n":"Hook, Line, and Sinker","g":201,"l":"Eastern La Noscea","s":178,"r":1}}]}
