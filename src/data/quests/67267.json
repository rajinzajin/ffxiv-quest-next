Assuming you will be unable to meet with the lords and ladies of each house, Torsefers asks that you deliver invitations to the guards standing watch at each house.","You speak with Bartelot at Haillenarte Manor and hand him the banquet invitation. He regretfully informs you that, although his lord would be pleased by the invitation, he has been kept busy in the wake of recent Dravanian assaults and matters concerning heretics. Move on to Dzemael Manor and deliver the next invitation.","You reach Dzemael Manor to find Jainelette standing guard outside. She tells you that her lord has been preoccupied with the restoration of Falcon's Nest and has little time for aught else. Nevertheless, she promises to see the invitation delivered. Proceed to Durendaire Manor to deliver the last invitation.","You deliver the invitation to Framoncis standing guard at Durendaire Manor, and he finds the proposed banquet to be suspect at best. He goes on to tell you that House Durendaire and House Fortemps are not on good terms. He agrees to deliver the invitation if only to prevent undue tension between the two houses. Report to Torsefers and inform him the invitations have been delivered.","You return to Torsefers empty-handed, and he is thankful for your assistance. He tells you that the four High Houses are descended from the heroes who helped establish Ishgard. Although they are a formidable alliance in the face of their Dravanian enemies, they are quick to turn on one another when seeking political clout. He warns you to be careful, as making new friends may also result in new enemies."],"objectives":["Deliver a formal invitation to Haillenarte Manor.","Deliver a formal invitation to Dzemael Manor.","Deliver a formal invitation to Durendaire Manor.","Report to Torsefers."],"dialogue":[{"name":"TORSEFERS","text":"Excuse me, adventurer.

Leaving these with the guards will do, but they must be delivered."},{"name":"TORSEFERS","text":"Do not let the guards intimidate you.

Their ancestors were the founders of Ishgard, and it is from their bloodlines the archbishop is chosen."},{"name":"TORSEFERS","text":"There is no force greater than their combined strength when pitted against the Horde. When vying for power here in Ishgard, however, they are like coeurls fighting for territory in a small pit. To involve yourself in politics here is a dangerous game.
