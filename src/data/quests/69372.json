Rather than engage her with more friendly banter, you set your sights on the enclave to meet with Cid.","You arrive at the Doman Enclave to find Cid preoccupied with the calm and quiet of the settlement, but his stern expression makes clear he understands why he has come. Though apprehensive of what awaits him at Gangos, Cid reaffirms his commitment to helping the Bozjan Resistance. Together you board the airship which bears the two of you to Gangos.","Together with Mikoto you delve into Cid's memories of Bozja Citadel. An arduous journey through his mind eventually leads you to a massive transmission tower, wherein you confront a manifestation of Cid's trauma in the form of Lord Varis.","The phantom of Cid's past is laid low, but something about this glimpse into the past still appears amiss. Realizing Lord Varis had no reason to be present at the citadel, he strains to remember who was the source of this anguished memory. In an instant his mind becomes clear, and the visage of Lord Varis is replaced by the man who shot him so many years ago─his own father, Midas nan Garlond. What's more, a closer inspection reveals he is in fact a thrall of the dreadwyrm Bahamut. With the mystery of Cid's past brought to light, you return to the waking world with the inscriptions of the blades of Gunnhildr, as well as an onerous truth.","Gerolt has begun work on reforging the blades of Gunnhildr, bringing the people of Bozja one step closer to reclaiming their homeland. There is much to do in preparation for their encounter with the Empire, and Marsak bids you speak with Gerolt to learn what part you yet have to play."],"objectives":["Ask after Cid at the Doman Enclave.","Speak with Mikoto.","Speak with Marsak."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GEROLT","text":"If it ain't about me forge, it'll have to wait, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">lad</span></span>.

Doma has a long way to go before it regains its former glory, but they're off to a good start."},{"name":"CID","text":"So I've heard. If the Bozjans wish to follow the Domans' lead, I plan to do what I can to help them."},{"name":"CID","text":"In fact, I've already spoken to Lord Hien and agreed to divert part of the Ironworks' resources to assist in Doma's reconstruction."},{"name":"CID","text":"The offer seemed to have taken him by surprise, but I assured him that in addition to the Ironworks' commitment to freedom through technology, I have my own reasons to reverse the destruction wrought by the Empire."},{"name":"CID","text":"While it's true that I eventually defected, I played no small part in the development of magitek now used by their military."},{"name":"CID","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Sometimes it's the threads you can't see that have the strongest ties.

And for that, I am sorry."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"If you can forgive me, let us be allies, united against a common foe."},{"name":"CID","text":"Come now, I'm the one who should apologize to you. After all my father and the Empire did, even if not all of their own volition, their crimes will never be forgotten."},{"name":"CID","text":"I'd hazard even victory over the Empire won't be enough to ease such pain. And even now that I know the truth behind the Bozja incident, all it's done is make me question the choices that led me here to this moment."},{"name":"CID","text":"But regardless of the past, we have to keep pressing forward, one step at a time. For freedom."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Just as the heroes of eld would have done. We Bozjans grew up on such tales, of peerless warriors pure of heart and unwavering in their conviction. Yet here we are, so full of doubt and uncertainty. Will we ever earn our place in the pages of history?"},{"name":"CID","text":"Cheer up, Bajsaljen. If we live long enough, perhaps we'll be the ones to pen them."},{"name":"CID","text":"You say the crystal focus is no longer responsive?"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"It would appear what stores of aether resided within it have been depleted.

When their forces reach Bozja, you know what must be done."},{"name":"MENENIUS","text":"Understood."},{"name":"GABRANTH","text":"The Empire is fated to fall. But in its place a new nation shall rise, grander and mightier than anything the Garleans could ever have dreamed."},{"name":"GABRANTH","text":"And it shall be made possible by the very power they abhor."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"I do not imagine he sympathizes with our plight, but from what I gather, he has no love for the Empire, either. If that will suffice in persuading him to aid us, then so be it."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"I hear there are engineers stationed at Rhalgr's Reach. Perhaps you can begin your search for Garlond there."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Unless...there is something else you wish to discuss?"},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"I would be lying if I said I understand what it is you must do, but I will pray for your safety all the same."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Is there aught you wish to discuss before you begin?"},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"On behalf of the Resistance, I thank you again for lending your strength to our cause. Reforging the blades of Gunnhildr is certain to stir the fire in our men's hearts."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"When the battle begins in earnest, I should hope we can count on your continued assistance."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Now then, is there aught you wish to discuss?"},{"name":"Q10","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A10","text":"Tell me about Bozja and the Resistance."},{"name":"A10","text":"Tell me about Gangos."},{"name":"A10","text":"Tell me about the Bozja incident."},{"name":"A10","text":"Tell me about yourself."},{"name":"A10","text":"Nothing."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Our home rests in the southern reaches of Ilsabard, to the west of Dalmasca."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Our earliest records─or at least those we have been able to recover─suggest Bozja was founded at some point during the Third Astral Era. The Allagan Empire had reached the height of its power, and several tribes of the Hrothgar came here seeking refuge from their supremacy."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"It was Queen Gunnhildr who would keep the Allagans at bay. Her radiance would light our path to prosperity, and by her grace was the nation of Bozja founded."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Alas, the Fourth Umbral Calamity would see the end of her kingdom. But those who survived slowly rebuilt, and Bozja was reborn as a city-state that would coexist with neighboring nations for centuries to come."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"The Garlean Empire's rise to power changed everything. None could oppose the sheer strength and versatility of their military."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Their campaign began some fifty years ago, and now an entire generation of our people has been raised knowing only oppression. But now they would know freedom."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"When word reached us that Ala Mhigo and Doma had risen up to defy the Empire, we seized the opportunity to flee and form pockets of resistance."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"With Lord Hien's assistance, the several groups that had formed were merged into a single, cohesive force, and I was chosen as its leader."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"If the IVth Imperial Legion is able to consolidate its forces in Bozja, however, our efforts will be for naught. We have to strike back, and soon."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"For the present, this is our base of operations, to the southeast of what remains of Bozja Citadel. When the fighting begins, we will hold the line here."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"For a blessing, the surrounding wetlands and the fog that persists year-round have served to conceal our operation. That is not to say, of course, we have not taken additional measures to remain hidden."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"In the unlikely event that their scouts should approach the perimeter, our mages have cast a cloaking spell around the area to keep us from sight."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Havens such as this are plentiful along the southern coast of Ilsabard. Our facilities are rather modest, I confess, but I would like to think we have made great strides in providing for our soldiers here."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Thanks to the generosity of our allies here in the East, as well as the Eorzean Alliance, we do not want for provisions or arms. All that remains is to secure the blades of Gunnhildr."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"It was roughly twenty years ago, if I'm not mistaken. The Empire, fearful of the threat posed by primals and the tribes who summoned them, devised a plan to wipe them out."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"The Meteor project. Through the use of magitek, they intended to recreate ancient sorcery capable of calling down meteors."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"At the helm of the project was their chief engineer, Midas nan Garlond. In time, every last one of their research facilities was involved in its development."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"The project would take a perilous turn when it was discovered that the lesser moon Dalamud was, in fact, a satellite of Allagan design. They were determined to make it part of their plans."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"And so they erected a colossal transmission tower, designed to control Dalamud. Its first test would also prove to be its last..."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"For lack of eyewitnesses, what happened next is difficult to describe. It is often described as an explosion, but the ruins showed no signs of gunpowder or magic. We only know that a terrible light shone from the heavens that night."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"In an instant, the citadel was gone. Its citizens and soldiers...my family..."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"No one is certain why Dalamud responded with such destructive force, but all work on the Meteor project was halted immediately."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Five years later, however, Nael van Darnus set the wheels of the project back into motion. His devotion was rewarded with the coming of the Seventh Umbral Calamity."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"The world has already paid too great a cost for the Garleans' ambition... They must be stopped."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"I was born in Bozja, though I have never known a life free from the Empire's rule.  "},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Following in my late father's footsteps, I studied to become a doctor. Much to my surprise, and dismay, my academic accomplishments did not go unnoticed. I was taken to the capital, where I received a formal education in medicinal sciences. Deployment as a medic in their military soon followed."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"My service was ultimately rewarded with citizenship, after which I met my wife, and we started a family together. If their goal was for me to grow content and complacent, it failed, for not a day went by that I did not think about the liberation of my homeland."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"But I would need to bide my time a while longer, for I was assigned to the IVth Imperial Legion. There was an uprising in Nagxia, and it fell to us to quell their insurrection. It was not until after our mission was complete that I learned of what happened to Bozja. To my family..."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"We returned as fast as we were able, but there was nothing left of the citadel."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"I was ordered to return to the capital, but I had to find my wife and children. I covered every ilm of that barren wasteland...and nothing."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Chains and a prison cell greeted me back in Garlemald, but in spite of my confinement, whispers of what happened in Bozja eventually reached me. Of their failed experiments to control Dalamud."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Stripped of my citizenship, I expected to remain under lock and key until the end of my days. Fortunately for me, they had need of more medics for their next campaign."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"But I would never reach the battlefield, for I escaped with a number of other soldiers to join the Resistance."},{"name":"BAISHAEN","text":"Many years of service to the Resistance then molded me into the man who now stands before you. And I will continue to serve for as long as it takes to see our homeland safe from the Empire."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"That you should know Cid Garlond is hardly surprising. I only hope he is not so engrossed in his work that he cannot find time to assist us."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"I will not keep you. Unless, of course, there is something you wish to ask me?"},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"We are quite fortunate that Mikoto was available to assist us. Never did I think she would devise such a unique solution to our problem."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"I'm sure the two of you have much to discuss, so I will leave you to your work. Unless there is something else you wish to ask me?"},{"name":"Q20","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A20","text":"Tell me about the IVth Imperial Legion."},{"name":"A20","text":"Tell me about Legatus Noah van Gabranth."},{"name":"A20","text":"Tell me about Castrum Lacus Litore."},{"name":"A20","text":"Tell me about yourself."},{"name":"A20","text":"Nothing."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"The initial invasion of Bozja was led by Basch van Gabranth. There would be a change of commander not long after, however."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Thirty years ago, during the invasion of Dalmasca, his health took an unexpected turn for the worse, and his son, Noah van Gabranth, oversaw the conquest to its completion. He was a mere twenty years old when he assumed full command."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"The IVth Imperial Legion itself is rather unique compared to most, for the bulk of their forces are not native Garleans, their present leader included."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Both Noah and his father were quite quick to bend the knee to Emperor Solus, from what I have been told. Perhaps it was that ardent loyalty that helped them rise to such prominence."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"But not all were such fervent followers of the Empire. Quite the contrary, I would hazard the greater part of their soldiers were like us, seeing little recourse but to serve lest they be put to the sword."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Though I suppose the unwavering loyalty of the IVth Imperial Legion is what serves to set it apart from the rest. Or to be more precise, its loyalty to Noah van Gabranth."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"What's more, you will come to find they are not wont to rely on magitek armaments like most imperial soldiers."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Indeed, they seem to prefer fighting the old-fashioned way, employing arcane magicks, techniques akin to summoning, and all manner of feral beasts rather than depending on heavy artillery."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Though if recent reports are to be believed, these will be the least of our concerns. The battalions en route to Bozja are said to be led by Lyon sas Helsos."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"He is a strategist whose cunning is matched only by his renown as a tamer of beasts, and it is rumored that he alone is worth more than a thousand rank-and-file troops. One might say he has history with the Resistance."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Ah yes, the leader of the IVth Imperial Legion, one of the youngest to ever take such a position. His father, Basch van Gabranth, served as legatus before him, claiming many a victory in the name of the Empire."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Basch was a knight of the Republic of Landis, which, like so many other nations, was fast to fall at the hands of the Empire. Rather than die with dignity, he was quite quick to bend the knee to their conquerors, ingratiating himself with the Emperor and earning his place as a legatus."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"This was quite a feat, given that he was not of Garlean blood. One can but imagine the lengths to which he went to earn their trust, but it is clear he labored hard to keep it."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"His health took an unexpected turn for the worse during the invasion of Dalmasca, which afforded Noah the opportunity he needed to rise to prominence. And it was under Noah's leadership that Rabanastre would fall."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Then, when his father passed two years later, he was named the next legatus of the IVth Imperial Legion."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Many believe it was the conquest of Dalmasca that earned him the position, but some argue he was appointed on the recommendation of the Emperor, perhaps in recognition of his father's service to the Empire."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Regardless of the reason, Noah would continue in his father's footsteps. The IVth Imperial Legion would continue to be comprised primarily of foreign soldiers, and their loyalty to the newly appointed legatus was unfaltering."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"One might expect such a legion to remain within the Emperor's good graces, but it would not be so when Varis took the throne. For several years he appointed them to the quelling of uprisings in remote provinces, as if to keep them at arm's length."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Perhaps he suspected an ulterior motive to the Gabranths seeking to gain such fervent adoration from the IVth Imperial Legion. I have no proof, of course, but one cannot help but wonder..."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"It was once known as Alermuc Fortress, erected in the hopes of deterring the Garleans. After the Bozja incident, it would be rebuilt and given a new name─Castrum Lacus Litore."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Its position to the north of Bozja will make it a critical strategic point in the battles to come. If we are to have any hope of reclaiming Bozja, we must first gain control of the castrum."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"The location was originally chosen for its natural defenses. Being surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs made Alermuc Fortress all but impregnable. Assuming, of course, one had the wherewithal to defend it."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"When the Garleans came, their magitek weaponry was unlike anything we had ever seen. A great many lives were lost in our struggle to hold the fortress, and in the end we were simply outmatched."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"At present, the castrum is held by Legatus Gabranth's second-in-command, Menenius rem Lanatus. An interesting choice, to say the least."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Lanatus is a well-known family with a long and august lineage. That is, until they incurred the ire of the Emperor, tarnishing their name and robbing them of their position in Garlean society."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"And yet Basch van Gabranth would choose members of their family to serve under him. Mayhap he sensed their desperation to redeem their honor. If that is the case, the road to redemption is long indeed, for two generations of Lanatus have served under the Gabranths."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Imagine the recognition they would receive for thwarting our attempts to take the fortress. You can be sure he will do all in his power to stop us."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"I serve primarily as liaison 'twixt the Bozjan Resistance and our allies. I'll not deny there is still much for me to learn, but I will do everything within my power to see Bozja free of the Empire. If that should mean my life, then so be it."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"You...wish to know of my past? It is no different than most, I would imagine─conscription by the Empire, which is the only reason I was not present in the citadel to die alongside my kin in the Bozja incident."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Some would call it a massacre planned by the Empire, but I am not ready to believe they would willingly kill so many of their own soldiers and engineers."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"Having been raised under the Garlean doctrine, I realize that not all of them are the bloodthirsty monsters many of us would paint them to be. Though the Empire would seek to oppress us, I do not share the same animosity towards its citizens as my Resistance comrades."},{"name":"MARSHAK","text":"But these are musings better left between the two of us, yes? I would not have the others think me a coward or a traitor to our cause."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"The son of Midas nan Garlond. An imperial deserter... My, what curious company we keep."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Ahem. Forgive me. Is there aught you need?"},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Would that I could do more to assist you and Mikoto, but I know when I am out of my depth."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"If there is aught else I can do to assist, you need only ask."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Our people yet want for the courage to fight, and I am confident the blades of Gunnhildr will afford them just that."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"There is still much we must do to prepare, but if there is aught else you wish to discuss...?"},{"name":"Q30","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A30","text":"Tell me about Queen Gunnhildr."},{"name":"A30","text":"Tell me about Gunnhildr's Blades."},{"name":"A30","text":"Tell me about the weapons you plan to forge."},{"name":"A30","text":"Tell me about yourself."},{"name":"A30","text":"Nothing."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"During the Third Astral Era, Queen Gunnhildr united the fragmented tribes of the Hrothgar to rise up and drove off the Allagans, eventually going on to found the nation of Bozja."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"It should be noted that Gunnhildr was not her name, but rather a title bestowed to the current monarch of any given age. The common thread connecting all rulers of Bozja is their ability to read the stars. There were others who shared in this ability, but they were said to be the greatest seers of their respective ages."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"They were also said to be great warriors. When doing battle with the Allagans or any other would-be invaders, the queen could always be found commanding from the front lines."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Alas, Bozja would fall in the wake of the Fourth Umbral Calamity. By some miracle, some few survived and were able to build what we knew as the city-state of Bozja."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"They were the elite guard of the queen, masters of myriad arms and magicks, said to be the greatest warriors of their age."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Their combat prowess was matched only by their devotion to Queen Gunnhildr. They would not hesitate to give their lives in her service. And, should one of these warriors fall in battle, their holy blade would be passed on to a suitable successor."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Over time, their title as Gunnhildr's Blades would become synonymous with the gunblade, which gained great renown during the war against the Allagans."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"There is not a Bozjan alive who does not know the tales of their heroism. I have no doubt reforging these weapons will lend us both the strength and resolve we need to succeed."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"With Master Gerolt's help, we have nearly all that is required to reforge the weapons of Queen Gunnhildr's guard."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"While it is true the legends of their might are duly inspiring, to simply call them the blades of Gunnhildr would do little to differentiate these new armaments from the weapons of eld. After all, we do not wish to give the impression that the originals have been recovered."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"After much thought, Master Gerolt offered a simple and surprisingly satisfactory suggestion of “Resistance weapons.”"},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"He also went on to make a rather curious remark about the steps to be taken in their forging: that these weapons can be enhanced further in accordance with the enemies one faces."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"By the sounds of it, these weapons are never truly complete until their purpose is fulfilled."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"It has been two years since I joined the Resistance. Before then I lived as all Bozjans did─under the harsh rule of the Empire."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"It is the only life I have ever known, though my parents often spoke to me of what they remembered from the days of Bozja's independence."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"Though it was under the auspices of our Garlean oppressors, I was educated in prehistoric archaeology."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"While I am thankful for the opportunities afforded me, I could not turn a blind eye to the suffering of my people. And so I left to join the Resistance."},{"name":"MEESIYA","text":"It was I who proposed to reforge the fabled weapons of Queen Gunnhildr's guard, and Bajsaljen has chosen to place his faith in my plan. I take heart in knowing all I learned from the Empire will be put to good use."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Our exploration of Master Gerolt's memories was a success. Largely in part to his trust in you, I suspect."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"How fortunate for us that you should be a good acquaintance of Cid's. I'm sure there is much you must do to prepare, so I will not keep you."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"...Was there something else?"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"I am afraid the crystal focus has fallen dormant."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"It will take time, but I am confident its reserves of energy can be replenished."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"You will be the first to know when the crystal focus is ready."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"If there is nothing else, I will leave you to your duties."},{"name":"Q40","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A40","text":"Tell me about the seers."},{"name":"A40","text":"Tell me about the crystal focus."},{"name":"A40","text":"Tell me about memory exploration."},{"name":"A40","text":"Tell me about your gift."},{"name":"A40","text":"Tell me about yourself."},{"name":"A40","text":"Nothing."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Scant though they are, the records we have uncovered thus far suggest the practices of seers date back as far as the Fourth Astral Era."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"The region was plagued with all manner of natural disasters in those days, inciting great unrest not only amongst the Bozjans, but neighboring nations as well."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"It was during these tumultuous times seers first appeared. In fact, I have reason to believe they possessed the Echo."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Using a crystal focus, they were able to delve into the minds of the downcast and the heartsick, seeking out their darkest memories and altering them to ease the peoples' burdens."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Perhaps they saw the altering of minds as a necessity for their survival, but we must consider the ethical implications of such methods in this day and age. I have no doubt my betters in Sharlayan would consider it to be reprehensible."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"My initial analysis of the crystals suggests they are man-made. Nothing in my data can prove the materials are unique to this region, which leads me to believe the Bozjans─or rather, the seers─created them."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"However, given the intricate lattices found in these crystals, it seems highly improbable that the Bozjans could have produced them, considering the methods available to them in the Fourth Astral Era."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"In fact, on closer inspection, it became clear that its structure is quite similar to that found in Allagan constructs."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Which then begs the question: who were the seers, and whence did they come? This is but a working theory, but I suspect their roots can be traced back to the Allagans themselves─perhaps survivors of the Fourth Umbral Calamity who wished to atone for the sins of their forebears."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"They came to these lands seeking a means to help the Bozjans, and in doing so created these crystal foci."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"...Ahem. As I said, 'tis but a working theory. Though I understand if it sounds more like a flight of fancy."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Perhaps I should start with a simple explanation, as I did before. Let us consider the composition of a person's aether, shall we? There is corporeal aether of the flesh, incorporeal aether of the soul, and the aetherial residue of an individual's memories."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Were one to be possessed of only corporeal aether, they would be but a walking corpse. Conversely, entities comprised of only incorporeal aether are referred to in layman's terms as ghosts. Of course, a ghost that possesses residual memories could likely recall its past and retain self-awareness."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Using a crystal focus, we can isolate the aetherial signature of memories, much in the same way the seers did. We can then delve into and explore specific memories conjured by the subject."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"We must be careful of what we observe, however, for while the information stored in a person's memories can be quite comprehensive, it is not always true to fact. They can be distorted due to the passage of time, or even when first committed to the mind as a result of personal bias."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"That is why it is important to mark the distinction between explicit and implicit memories."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Explicit memories are those consciously stored and recalled, while implicit memories are more passively accumulated by our subconscious."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"When meeting someone for the first time, their appearance will be kept as part of our explicit memory, though this may fade with the passing of time. Should a great deal of time pass without meeting, however, such recollection can prove difficult."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Yet in that moment, your mind also takes record of everything experienced by your sensory nervous system."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Unfortunately, information called from explicit memory is quite sensitive to misrepresentations of events. After all, if an individual is actively choosing to recall an event, who is to say they will not make alterations to better suit their liking?"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"That is why we seek information from implicit memory, which is more likely to be preserved free of the bias of an individual's worldview."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"The Echo can manifest itself in myriad ways dependent on the individual. I was gifted with the ability to peer into the future."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"It is a power much like prophetic dreams and divinations, and yet quite different, for such visions only tell of the future's potential."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"The Echo does not show me what may happen, but what <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> happen."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Scholars speculate Mezaya Thousand Eyes too shared this gift, hence the alarming accuracy of the passages writ in her <span class=\"emphasis\">Divine Chronicles</span>."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"These visions are a decidedly rare occurrence, usually containing some crucial insight into matters presently unfolding before me. For better or worse, I have never had visions of an impending threat on my life or those around me."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Not that I would want to see such things, of course. Could you imagine, knowing of certain doom that cannot be avoided?"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"I once spoke of my visions to an acquaintance─a relatively harmless glimpse of the future─and it resulted in a terrible argument. I fear I could not bear the weight of grimmer tidings..."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"But that is neither here nor there. My gift is but a trivial thing. Nothing you should think to rely upon."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"About me!? Oh, there really isn't much to tell, I assure you!"},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Well, if you must know... Due to advanced placement I found myself attending the Studium much earlier than most. My research in the field of aetherology would eventually earn me the title of Archon. When I am not conducting research in the field, I conduct lectures at the Studium."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Moenbryda is, er...was...my mentor. I would not be the scholar I am today if not for her. I have fond memories of the many nights we toiled together working on her original plans for the aetheric siphon. She was like a sister to me."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"Speaking of which, I do have a sister, actually. An identical twin, in fact. Though we have not spoken since she too was named an Archon."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"She was my better in all aspects of academia, but she often disagreed with the views of the Forum. I can but assume that is why she took her leave of the Studium."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"She was always so strong-willed and quite critical of those around her. Sadly, we never got along very well growing up. I often wonder if that is why Moenbryda was so quick to take me under her wing."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"I still see her, in my dreams. Always offering a warm smile and words of encouragement."},{"name":"MIKOTO","text":"If we were to use the crystal focus, perhaps there would be a way to speak with her again.
