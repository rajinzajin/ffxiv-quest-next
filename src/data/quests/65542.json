You are looking ever more a botanist. I do believe you are ready to take on further responsibilities for the guild."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Guilds such as ours exist only by virtue of the cooperation of their members. Each individual must set an example for the rest if the collective is to thrive. The time has come for you to set just such an example."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"A matter has arisen, the handling of which I would entrust wholly to you. You may deal with it as you see fit, providing you see the problem solved."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"The matter in question concerns a valued client of ours─the merchant Albgast. It would appear one of our number has done something to upset him."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Pray seek out the merchant at the Ebony Stalls and inquire after the reason for his ire. Oh, and choose your words well, lest you add fuel to the fire."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Fufucha sent you, did she? Good. I'm not a man to mince words, so forgive me if I seem blunt."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"You know what marjoram is? But of course you do─you're a bleeding botanist! It's a very common ingredient in alchemy, isn't it? <span class=\"emphasis\">Very</span> common."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you botanists supposed to be the experts in harvesting such stuff? Yes, you are. Strange, then, that the <span class=\"emphasis\">expert</span> who brought me my last batch of fresh marjoram didn't so much harvest the poor plants as <span class=\"emphasis\">dismember</span> them!"},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Why, the leaves were so torn up, I couldn't recognize what they were at first. Needless to say, they're next to useless."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"So, thanks to your herb-hacking colleague, I have no marjoram to make my concoctions. Which is why I inquired at your guild─only to be told you were out of supplies. And here we are."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Now, if it ain't too much trouble, I would be obliged if you could bring me ten sprigs of fresh marjoram. And I'd please like them <span class=\"emphasis\">whole</span>, as opposed to the fine bleeding purée your bush-butchering colleague delivered."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Truth be told, I don't much care about your hatchet-happy friend. What I <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> care about is not keeping my customers waiting for their medicine. In short: hurry."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Oh, and for the love of the gods, be gentle with the plants, will you? I shouldn't have to say it, but after the last bloke, I'm not taking any chances."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Did you get the marjoram? The herb is said to grow around the Matron's Lethe, though I hardly need to tell a botanist this. Do hurry─I'm keeping dozens of customers waiting."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Ah, the marjoram! And such fine specimens! I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time, friend. Thanks to you, I can get back to making echo drops."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"Do you know of echo drops? They are an alchemical concoction that restores voice to silenced lips, allowing the imbiber to cast spells again. Conjurers and thaumaturges never leave home without a bottle or three."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"But I must say again, these are some of the finest specimens of marjoram I've seen, and they're none the worse for the picking. It's clear you know your way around a plant."},{"name":"ALBGAST","text":"As for your colleague with the heavy hand, I'm certain your guild will deal with him appropriately. Thanks again, and send my regards to Fufucha."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Ah, there you are. Thank you for a job well done. There's no need to report the details─I have already heard all I need to know."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"It is my belief that the botanist in question had naught but personal gain in mind when he so hurriedly harvested the marjoram. In his haste to complete the task and claim its reward, he damaged the herbs and rendered them useless."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Such greed brings shame on our guild, and I will not tolerate it. The offender's name shall be struck from our roll."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"As I taught you when you first came to us, a botanist nurtures the natural environment to the mutual benefit of man and wood. He who thinks only of his own benefit has no respect for nature and is unfit to call himself one of us."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Of course, you hardly need reminding of this. Something tells me you shall never give me cause to worry."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"But let us speak of cheerier matters. Tell me, did gathering the marjoram pose you any trouble?"},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"If you ever find your work unduly onerous, you might consider outfitting yourself with better gear. Even something as seemingly insignificant as a new pair of boots can make a world of difference."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"As you gain in knowledge and experience, you will find yourself venturing farther afield in search of new bounty, and your choice of equipment will become ever more critical."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"Go now, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, and keep up your efforts. I look forward to seeing you continue to grow as a botanist."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Certain gear grants bonuses to your <span class=\"highlight\">gathering</span>, <span class=\"highlight\">perception</span>, and <span class=\"highlight\">GP</span> values."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"A higher gathering rating improves your chances of obtaining an item; greater perception raises the amount of items obtained; and additional GP increases your extracting stamina."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Outfitting yourself with an eye to your objectives will increase the efficiency of your gathering endeavors."}],"reward":{"gil":382,"items":[{"id":2561},{"id":3023,"one":1},{"id":3322,"one":1},{"id":3549,"one":1},{"id":3774,"one":1},{"num":2,"id":5824,"one":1}],"xp":15120},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":18}],"quests":[65541]},"next":[65543]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1000815","obj":{"i":1000815,"n":"Fufucha","l":53,"q":20,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1000239","obj":{"i":1000239,"n":"Albgast","l":53,"s":1,"q":1,"t":"Independent Apothecary","a":564,"c":[14.66,8.87]}},{"type":"item","id":"2561","obj":{"i":2561,"n":"Recruit's Scythe","l":16,"c":38151,"t":31}},{"type":"item","id":"3023","obj":{"i":3023,"n":"Cotton Shepherd's Tunic","l":15,"c":42173,"t":35,"p":468}},{"type":"item","id":"3322","obj":{"i":3322,"n":"Cotton Shepherd's Slops","l":15,"c":45139,"t":36,"p":360}},{"type":"item","id":"3549","obj":{"i":3549,"n":"Goatskin Wristguards","l":16,"c":48231,"t":37,"p":365}},{"type":"item","id":"3774","obj":{"i":3774,"n":"Hard Leather Espadrilles","l":15,"c":46185,"t":38,"p":384}},{"type":"item","id":"5824","obj":{"i":5824,"n":"Allagan Bronze Piece","l":15,"c":26001,"t":61}},{"type":"item","id":"4832","obj":{"i":4832,"n":"Marjoram","l":15,"c":25015,"t":45}},{"type":"quest","id":"65541","obj":{"i":65541,"n":"Weapons of a Feather","g":145,"l":"Gridania","s":100,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"65543","obj":{"i":65543,"n":"Dressed to Harvest","g":145,"l":"Gridania","s":200,"f":1}}]}
