I strongly suspect that only a haul of crystals would outweigh the value of a potential tempered slave."},{"name":"NARUJIBOH","text":"If this is true, then we cannot allow the contents of those boxes to reach the Zahar'ak Amalj'aa and their summoning rituals! ...And considering the circumstances of his misfortune, I think it best that you be the one to approach this trader and confirm my suspicions."},{"name":"NARUJIBOH","text":"(deleted)"},{"name":"NARUJIBOH","text":"(deleted)"},{"name":"MERCHANT","text":"Oh, thank Nald, an adventurer!
