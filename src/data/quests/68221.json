Might I ask your help with something?"},{"name":"YANA","text":"Some of our new recruits were poisoned by a shiranui earlier and have turned feral."},{"name":"YANA","text":"My comrade to the northeast of our headquarters is dealing with them as we speak. I fear, however, that he may need reinforcements. Could you please go and assist him?"},{"name":"YANA","text":"Please will you help my comrade save the recruits affected by shiranui poison? You should be able to find them to the northeast of our headquarters."},{"name":"BIGANDBRAWNYMAN02685","text":"Thank the kami you came! The poison has turned these men to beasts and bringing this one down has drained me of most of my strength. There are two others, however, who are still rampaging along the coastline. I need you to stop them."},{"name":"BIGANDBRAWNYMAN02685","text":"They should be quite easy to spot. Even if you do not catch sight of them, if you are in the area long enough, they will come to you. Hereâ”€take this stunning powder."},{"name":"BIGANDBRAWNYMAN02685","text":"Tire them out with a few well-placed jabs then blow this into their faces. I shall then come around and collect them. Oh, and do take care not to hit too hard. I would hate to have to report a death on my watch."},{"name":"BIGANDBRAWNYMAN02685","text":"Tire them out, then blow the stunning powder into their faces.

I will take it from here."},{"name":"BIGANDBRAWNYMAN02685","text":"While I am tending to my men, might you return to Yana and let her know that everything is now under control?"},{"name":"YANA","text":"What a relief it is to hear that everyone is fine. &lt;sigh&gt; That such a mess could arise in the first place, however, still puzzles me. I would have thought it common sense to avoid approaching a shiranui."},{"name":"YANA","text":"It is said these beasts are the souls of men and women who died at sea. In never having been buried, they are unable to find closure and remain upon this earth, poisoning the souls of the living with their noxious breath."},{"name":"YANA","text":"Perhaps the people of Koshu never learned the tale, and that is why our new batch of underlings did not have the sense to run when they saw the creature."},{"name":"YANA","text":"If you can help it, you best stay far away from them, too!
