He motions for you and the others to follow him deeper into the hidden sanctuary.","The commander listens patiently as Alphinaud explains the details of the Eorzean Alliance's proposal. Together they would expel the imperial presence from Gyr Abania─or as Conrad wryly puts it, “engage them by proxy” with the vastly inferior forces of the Resistance. In any event, such weighty decisions cannot be made lightly, and the commander and his officers will need time to reach a consensus."],"objectives":["Speak with Conrad."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It's hard to feel at ease with that giant statue looking down on you..."},{"name":"YSHTOLA","text":"Fascinating...
