Curious Gorge, recent experiences still weighing heavily on his heart, will stay behind.","No sooner had you taken the armor into hand than did Curious Gorge appear to claim it from you with nary a word of explanation. What has brought about this change of heart from your mentor? Return to Hidden Falls to seek an explanation.","Curious Gorge offers his apology for his actions, explaining that he cannot trust you, himself, or anyone to wear the armor until the would-be wearer's strength is demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt. He bids you to return to your training while he studies the texts to see how such strength might be proven.<br><br>※The next warrior quest will be available from Curious Gorge upon reaching level 50."],"objectives":["Search for the relic armor at the Weeping Saint.","Speak with Curious Gorge."],"dialogue":[{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"You would truly seek the ultimate relic of my people? The armor that could consume the very soul of the most puissant warrior? Very well, if you are truly convinced of your readiness, I will not be the one to stand in your way."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"But I beg of you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─the moment you feel yourself losing control, and your inner beast overcoming you, cast the armor aside. Cast it from the highest mountain or into the depths of the ocean, I care not."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"For once the beast consumes your soul, there is no going back. You will rage on, a monster, leaving naught but carnage in your wake. The realm will bleed, and history will repeat itself. I cannot allow this to happen."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"No, my people have been shunned long enough. I would see the coming of a new age, in which warriors protect the weak and are loved and admired by the people of the realm. My years of battle and sleepless nights spent poring over the ancient texts─all has been for this day!"},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"Brother... I know not where fate has led you. And yet I feel certain that, in spirit, you stand with me today. Together, we will restore the honor of our people."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"...You must forgive my sentiment, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. As I said, this has been a long time coming. The breastplate you seek is in the highlands of Coerthas, at the spring they call the Weeping Saint. I...will stay behind. The events at Wineport still weigh heavy on my heart."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"Hand over the breastplate, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. After much wrestling with the thought, I simply cannot entrust such a relic to an outsider who may be overwhelmed by its power."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"I return now to Hidden Falls. If you would have words with me, then come. I will not run away."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I am sorry. I did not mean for things to happen like this, but I had no choice."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"I have wrestled long and hard with the matter, but this is my decision. I cannot trust you with this power when I do not even trust myself."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"Aye, that's right: I won't attempt to don the plate again, either─nor will anyone. Not until I have proof that there is one with a will strong enough to withstand the beast's siren call."},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"Peer deep within your soul, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Peer into the eyes of the beast that stares back at you. Can you truly say that you can engage the monster in battle and emerge victorious?"},{"name":"CURIOUSGORGE","text":"I shall return to the tome. If there are any answers to be found, they lie within those pages. In the meantime, continue your training, that you might find an answer of your own."},{"name":"POP","text":"You sense a hostile presence!"},{"name":"ACCESS","text":"The enemy is still about!"}],"reward":{"action":51,"xp":12420},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":45,"id":22}],"quests":[66588]},"next":[66590]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1006746","obj":{"i":1006746,"n":"Curious Gorge","l":32,"q":15}},{"type":"action","id":"51","obj":{"i":51,"n":"Steel Cyclone","c":2552,"j":21,"t":3,"l":45}},{"type":"quest","id":"66588","obj":{"i":66588,"n":"Looking the Part","g":149,"l":"Eastern La Noscea","s":4,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"66590","obj":{"i":66590,"n":"How to Quit You","g":149,"l":"Eastern La Noscea","s":6,"f":1}}]}
