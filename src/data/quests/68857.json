And while it is plain we've not seen the last of General Ran'jit, I for one am glad to delay our reckoning with him awhile longer."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"It seems I was wrong about your friend. Had Feo Ul not stepped in, you'd be frolicking with the faeries by now."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"I'm going to train harder. Having seen what you've achieved, it's the least I can do."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Though the battle is over, the war is far from won. Let us fix our gaze upon the road ahead."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"I knew you could do it. And not only because of your blessing. You have a strength all your own, and it has seen us through many a trial."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"With the Warden defeated, I believe our work here is done. It is time we were going─<span class=\"emphasis\">together</span>, needless to say."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"...To the bitter end─the fate of our two worlds being at stake, and all that."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Now then, I suggest we hurry back to the Crystarium. Much and more may have happened while we were frolicking with the fae folk."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"That Ran'jit elected to pursue us makes me hopeful the city was spared Eulmore's attentions, but I would sooner see for myself."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Besides, I believe I speak for us all when I say that I've had a bellyful of Il Mheg. Let us away before the faeries think to play with us again."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I see nothing out of the ordinary."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Though we've spent most of our time on the road, Minfilia and I actually have apartments here. Perhaps now we may finally make use of them."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"All seems well, thank goodness..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"The city appeareth unchanged from when last I visited. There is the selfsame comforting hum of activity in the air."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? I...I was not expecting you so soon."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"Glad though I am to see you, I daresay you are missed by your comrades. Mayhap you should rejoin them first."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Finding common ground with an Ascian... My entire being rebels at the very notion."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"He appears to be gone, but I won't be lowering my guard just yet."},{"name":"RYNE","text":"So that was an Ascian... Thancred told me about them."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"That an Ascian of Emet-Selch's standing should willingly reveal himself unto us─and at this of all junctures─is...most interesting."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Cooperation</span>? He can't be serious...can he?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Well, we've certainly been given much to ponder, but first things first: we should report to the Exarch."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"You can run along, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. We're perfectly capable of handling this little task."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"In light of your recent exertions, I'd say you've earned a rest."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Go on, take yourself off to bed. We'll see you later, refreshed and ready for more."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"That your safe and triumphant return should be spoiled by an uninvited guest..."},{"name":"MYSTERYVOICE","text":"But let us not dwell on it here and now. I will have the details of your mission from the others. You, meanwhile, should get some rest."},{"name":"GUIDEOFTHEPENDANTS","text":"Ah, welcome back, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>. We've been expecting you."},{"name":"GUIDEOFTHEPENDANTS","text":"You will find refreshments laid out in your quarters. We hope they are to your liking."},{"name":"GUIDEOFTHEPENDANTS","text":"Will you be retiring now?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"Retire to your quarters?"},{"name":"GUIDEOFTHEPENDANTS","text":"Very good, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">miss</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>.
