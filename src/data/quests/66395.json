","Bloeidin is concerned about his scouts, who eat far too much weevil and too little meat and fish. Grill them a large trout using the nearby campfire.","The fish looks enticingly crispy, a credit to your cooking prowess. Remove it from the fire.","You have a grilled warmwater trout of great size, with deliciously singed skin and succulent flesh. You will not see its like again. Give it to the three Red Swallows.","Notwithstanding the disheartening lack of three-star reviews, the scouts have been fed. Inform Commander Bloeidin that his troops are satiated.","Having spoken with the commander, you find your heart strangely stirred by his words of admiration for his soldiers. While it would have been better manners for the scouts to have exclaimed over the fish, it cannot be expected of former pirates."],"objectives":["Grill the trout at the nearby campfire.","Take the grilled trout off the fire.","Give the grilled trout to the soldiers.","Report to Bloeidin."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BLOEIDIN","text":"The commissary finally received a shipment this morningâ”€that should make things a bit easier around here. The brass sent me a fresh warmwater trout, biggest I've seen. The privilege of command, eh?"},{"name":"BLOEIDIN","text":"But I can't rightly eat it myself. My three best scouts haven't had anything like real food in weeks. They're out finding paths and breaking kobold skulls every day.
