You are to take up position in Yedlihmad's town square, and wait for the boy thief to appear. The trap is set...<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level.","The pickpocket appears and takes Ogul's bait. Tail carefully after the boy thief, and see where─and more importantly, to whom─he leads you.<br><br>※In the event of failure, return to the designated location to reattempt the objective.","You follow the young pickpocket to his clandestine meeting with a full-grown criminal associate. Your sudden appearance startles them into sudden flight to the west, in the very direction where Ogul should be lying in wait...","You arrive at the scene of the ambush, only to find that Ogul has already rendered the Arkasodara man unconscious. Racashir, for his part, expresses remorse for his actions, and agrees to help explain the situation to the authorities. Ogul asks that you return to Yedlihmad and convey your success to Kancana while she delivers the lowlife to the Radiant Host.","Ogul walks in as you complete your report, and assures Kancana that her stolen belongings will soon be returned. Having allowed the remorseful pickpocket to keep her money, however, the generous Au Ra's coinpurse is empty once more─a fact which seems to bother her little. Thanks to your support, Ogul claims to have conquered her fear of the Arkasodara, and feels no great urgency to leave Thavnair while there are still so many wonders to explore..."],"objectives":["Wait at the designated location.","Wait at the designated location, then follow the boy thief without being seen.","Rendezvous with Ogul.","Report to Kancana."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KANCANA","text":"I appreciate your help with all this..."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"A new hunt begins!

If what we suspect is true, then he will likely take any ill-gotten gains directly to his “patron.”"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"So, I will play the part of an unguarded traveler, flaunting a heavy purse or some such. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you keep watch for the little pickpocket, and be ready to follow him when he makes his move."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Should he lead you to some shadowy figure, then I want you to herd them both to the west.

I'm impressed."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Grandmother always said, “If you want to catch the big fish, don't spare the bait!” The same idea applies to slippery criminals."},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Right, then! Let us take our places in the town square, and lay the trap for our quarry. I will try to make the lure something obvious, so you can see it being stolen from afar."},{"name":"KANCANA","text":"Do be careful, won't you?"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"Swiftly now, into position!"},{"name":"OGUL","text":"The hunt is on!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The boy thief has led you to a suspicious-looking Arkasodara man!"},{"name":"OFFENDER04492","text":"Oooh, you're a proper little scoundrel, aren't you?
