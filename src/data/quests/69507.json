He then sends you on your way, certain the threat of imminent death will not deter you from seeing the job done.<br><br>※Bitter memories can be obtained in the field fighting at the southern front, by clearing any level 60 dungeon, or completing Duty Roulette: Leveling. The Unrestricted Party option cannot be enabled when clearing the aforementioned dungeons.","You return to Gangos to find Gerolt surprisingly sober and ready to work. With his customary flourish and flair, Gerolt readies his forge, and before long you are the proud owner of a powerful new Resistance weapon. There is no time to celebrate, however, as an employee of Rowena soon arrives offering a means to pay for Gerolt's previous dealings with the House of Splendors. Matters of money aside, Zlatan prays for your continued success in the fight against the Empire.
