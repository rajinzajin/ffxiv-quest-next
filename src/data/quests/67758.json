As exciting as the thought is, we cannot allow ourselves to grow remiss in our duties, as maintaining this level of popularity will prove to be the real challenge!"},{"name":"CHAMBERLAIN02222","text":"To celebrate this most wondrous occasion, we have prepared some traditional Far Eastern roasted rice cakes─a dessert currently all the rage amongst the nobles, who are always entranced by the exotic. By distributing these sweets alongside our flyers, we hope to garner the people's interest and entice them to gather before our Little Ladies' Day stage. Tedious though it may be, you would do us a great service were you to assist us in this endeavor."},{"name":"CHAMBERLAIN02222","text":"You're back already, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>? Do you think our flyers and cakes did the trick?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This quest may be undertaken multiple times. The quantity of flyers distributed in any given World will be reflected in the appearance of the Songbirds, as their costumes and performances grow more extravagant over time."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Join forces with your fellow adventurers, complete the quest as often as you desire, and watch as your efforts transform the Songbirds into stars!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSA02222","text":"Little Ladies' Day─I can't believe it's already that time of year again! The days simply seem to fly by!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSA02222","text":"What's this? A sweetcake and a concert flyer? Hm, if these girls are as charming as you claim, I'll see if I can make the time to attend."},{"name":"RESIDENTSA02222","text":"Ah, so this is the group I passed by earlier on Emerald Avenue? I'll have need to sort out my schedule, but you might just see me there tonight."},{"name":"RESIDENTSA02222","text":"Oh, yes! I know all about the Songbirds. I went to see them yesterday and was deeply impressed. You can bet your left leg I won't be missing any more of their shows!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSB02222","text":"There's nothing quite so stunning as the pink of peach blossoms lining the streets of Ul'dah at this time of year. Puts even the most restless of souls at ease, eh?"},{"name":"RESIDENTSB02222","text":"By the looks of it, these “Songbirds” or other have shoveled off all the grunt work onto you, eh, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lass</span><span class=\"alternative\">lad</span></span>? Well, so long as it comes with this here cake, I suppose I could take your flyer."},{"name":"RESIDENTSB02222","text":"So these are the girls that have been singing and dancing down at Emerald Avenue, eh? I might have a friend or two who could be convinced to come along."},{"name":"RESIDENTSB02222","text":"Is this what I think it is!? I went to see the Songbirds the other night and didn't regret a second of it! When Masha starts dancing, even the heavens above pause to gaze upon her in awe."},{"name":"RESIDENTSC02222","text":"All this work has left me with little time to partake in the ongoing festivities and an itch in the back of my throat─the likes of which can only be satisfied by a flagon of quality ale. If I were to steal a moment for myself, the chief surely wouldn't notice!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSC02222","text":"Can't say the name “Songbirds” rings a bell─not that it actually matters. I can't much stand all that screaming and shouting that tends to accompany such events. This rice cake, on the other hand, looks like something I could actually enjoy."},{"name":"RESIDENTSC02222","text":"Lately, I've been seeing these rice cakes all throughout the city. You're handing these out for those performers...the Songbirds, was it? If I feel up to it, I might have a gander at their next showing after work."},{"name":"RESIDENTSC02222","text":"Is this another one of those rice cakes? I've eaten so many of these things, I'm all but obligated to go now!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSD02222","text":"My passion in life is to seek beauty in even the simplest of things. In fact, you might even consider me an expert on the matter."},{"name":"RESIDENTSD02222","text":"Attempting to lure in an audience with sweets, are you? Well, such trickery won't work on me! F'lhaminn is the only singer worthy of the title “songstress,” and I refuse to become tangled in whatever illicit schemes you weave!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSD02222","text":"Oh, yes. I tried listening to them earlier but they don't possess even a fraction of F'lhaminn's prowess. I'll eat your cake, but know I have no intention of ever supporting your Songbirds."},{"name":"RESIDENTSD02222","text":"Ah, the Songbirds' rice cake, is it? There's no denying they lack F'lhaminn's flair but I must admit that part of me has come to respect the Songbirds. They try harder than anyone I've ever known."},{"name":"RESIDENTSE02222","text":"Hmm, I can't help but feel as though there's something I forgot to buy."},{"name":"RESIDENTSE02222","text":"Ah, that's it─I forgot the rice cake! Today must be my lucky day, to think that someone would be walking around handing some out for free! I can't say I'm interested in this Songbird group but you have my thanks!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSE02222","text":"Oh, you're still handing these out, are you? I'm on my way to wander the marketplace, so I might stop by on my way back."},{"name":"RESIDENTSE02222","text":"Spare me the speech, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>─when you've gotten as many of these as I have, you've practically got it memorized! Besides, they've already won me over with their beaming smiles and adorable little routine."},{"name":"RESIDENTSF02222","text":"Little Ladies' Day is in full swing and I couldn't be any happier! It's depressing to think that soon these clouds of pink blossoms will be giving way to barren skies. If only the festivities could continue all year round!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSF02222","text":"Doesn't this look absolutely scrumptious! If those girls are as good as this wonderful cake, I might just have to give them a chance."},{"name":"RESIDENTSF02222","text":"Another one of these delicious rice cakes─what a pleasant surprise! And speaking of pleasant surprises, I went to see the Songbirds. Aren't they all so charming?"},{"name":"RESIDENTSF02222","text":"The Songbirds...as in Ulala's group, “the Songbirds”? I've come to very much admire Ulala, so it goes without saying that they have my full support!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSG02222","text":"No matter how old you get, Little Ladies' Day is the one thing that can put a smile on any girl's face. A proper Ul'dahn tradition, if I say so myself!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSG02222","text":"You say, by circulating these flyers, you hope to grow the Songbirds' name? My apologies but I strain to find the appeal of such frivolities as singing and dancing. The little delight, however, is something I can appreciate."},{"name":"RESIDENTSG02222","text":"Ah, yes, a Songbirds flyer, is it? I can only imagine how difficult it must be for budding young stars to fully blossom, with memories of Ul'dah's legendary songstress looming over them. I might attend and show some support, should I happen to find myself in the area."},{"name":"RESIDENTSG02222","text":"Of all the things, I would say it was your persistence that won me over. While I had thought F'lhaminn would remain the undisputed Songstress of Ul'dah for a long time to come, the Songbirds have convinced me that there is room enough in this city–state for...shall we say, <span class=\"emphasis\">comparable</span> talent."},{"name":"RESIDENTSH02222","text":"My daughter has me rushing about town to fill her never-ending list of orders for Little Ladies' Day. My goodness! Girls her age are nigh impossible to please!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSH02222","text":"Oh, what a fine little rice cake! If all else scheduled for Little Ladies' Day fails, this at least will put a smile on her lips. I'll leave it wrapped in the flyer, but I doubt she'll bother to look."},{"name":"RESIDENTSH02222","text":"Oh, the gods know I can't say no to you or your tasty treats! My daughter absolutely loved the last one and that wasn't the only thing─the Songbirds have found themselves a fan in my little girl!"},{"name":"RESIDENTSH02222","text":"Oh, it's you again! Day and night my daughter speaks of how she's going to be just like Narumi when she's older. Gods have mercy! No matter how many times I tell her singing and dancing won't put food on the table, she refuses to see reason."},{"name":"CHAMBERLAIN02222","text":"Already I can hear the city buzzing with excitement in anticipation of our next performance! You've certainly earned yourself a nice long break. The girls are taking a quick recess, and I'm sure they'd be delighted if you decided to join them."},{"name":"Q1","text":"Would you like to visit with the Songbirds?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Yes."},{"name":"A1","text":"No."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Oh, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, we were also handing out flyers, but it was <span class=\"emphasis\">miserable</span>! Most passersby would brush straight past us without so much as a glance!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"We may be invisible now, Narumi, but give it a bit more time. Soon the crowds will be chanting “Ooh la la, Ulala.” After that, we'll be able to forget we ever even had need for flyers!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Ulala's got it <span class=\"emphasis\">mostly</span> right. We cannot allow a few dismissive shrugs and smiles to deter us. Fear not, Narumi. We shall conquer Ul'dah, one fan at a time, if that's what it takes!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Oh, girls, I'm sorry for complaining! You're completely right─I can't allow myself to be so easily discouraged."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"There's no need to apologize. You know we're always here for you if you ever need us. Now, let's make our way back onto the streets and win ourselves some new fans!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, your hard work is always appreciated. Sadly, while people seem to be a lot more willing to accept and even read through our flyers, we've found that they still hesitate to come to our shows."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Maybe handing out flyers and sweets alone is not enough to attract a crowd. We've been focusing so hard on making people take our handouts that we've neglected to practice our singing and dancing."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Oooh, don't tell me you want to do that <span class=\"emphasis\">now</span>. My bones creak with exhaustion even as we speak. Can't we do that after I've taken a nice long rest?"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Giving up already, Ulala? What happened to wanting to become Eorzea's number one songstress?"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"P–Pfft! I...I was only joking about taking a break, of course. Why, I'm so full of energy I feel as though I could dance and sing all day."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! How was it? Things could certainly have gone better for us. &lt;sniff&gt; It would seem even my charm has its limits."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Yes, it was quite disappointing. Despite managing to gather together a small crowd, not a single person remained for longer than a few moments. I fear that mayhap even the average street performers of Ul'dah surpass us in skill."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"I–It's true, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I–I'm so afraid we'll end up naught but failures, left to wither away on the streets with the peach blossoms at festival's end."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Well, all this whining certainly isn't going to accomplish anything! If you two have time to mope, then you should also have the time to pick yourselves back up, look to the skies, and reach for the stars!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; While Ulala should be the last person to accuse anyone of whining, she is once again, correct. So long as we practice, practice, and practice some more, there is no obstacle too great!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, we finally have some good news! People have started passing by our stage in droves, more often than not with flyers in hand! It's hard to say for certain, but I think our audience may be growing, as well! ...Don't you two think so?"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Oh, yes! I've seen it too! Our flyers appear to be doing the trick!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Ha ha ha! And no doubt the song-starved masses, captivated by my boundless charm, will keep coming back for more!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, our newfound success has even convinced the royal seneschal to buy us new costumes! We're finally starting to look like the top-tier songstresses that we strive to become, and we owe it all to the many people who have and continue to support us from behind the scenes."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Which is why we would like to properly thank you once again for your tireless efforts!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"You're here, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! There's something we want to tell you before anyone else has the chance. Some of our most enthusiastic fans have banded together to form the Birdwatchers. Can you believe it?"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Indeed. We've come to recognize certain faces─people in the crowd who attend every one of our shows. Some even come bearing gifts or signs!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"You should have seen the wild look in the eyes of some of the girls that came to our last few performances. Like spriggans transfixed by the most exquisite of gems, they simply couldn't tear their gaze away from me!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"...As I recall, those were the selfsame people holding “We Love You, Narumi!” banners, were they not?"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"L–Lies, Masha! People are attracted to the flaming passion that burns within me and maybe one day─just like those girls─you'll come to see it, too!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Tee hee hee, you're here, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Tell me, is it a crime to be this happy? Our dancing and singing has improved so much that soon F'lhaminn will be but a memory to the people of Ul'dah!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"While I wouldn't go so far as to say <span class=\"emphasis\">that</span>, I feel very confident in the steady progress we have been making. Narumi's dancing especially has become so natural I might have need to redouble my efforts for fear of falling behind."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">You</span> need to? I can barely keep up as it is!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"There are times I still struggle to hit the high notes for some of our songs, but so long as we're willing to work to improve, our shortcomings are nothing to be ashamed of, Narumi."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"You both have my sympathies, but as I've already mastered singing and dancing, the only thing left for me to do is learn to better channel my natural charm!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, listen to this! I'm so happy I can't stop shaking."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"What's gotten into you? I don't think I've ever seen you this excited before."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"A nickname, Masha! The fans─they gave me a nickname! It just goes to show how much they love me. Now there's no denying it. I'm truly a star!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Congratulations, Ulala. Though, I believe Narumi's been referred to by fans as Goldengale for quite some time now."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"I–I'm so sorry, Ulala! I think the name the fans gave you is just as pretty. Redcap, was it?"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, thanks to you, today's show was a success! I never thought I'd perform in front of so many people! How can we ever repay you?"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Indeed...it's almost comical to think much of that success can be attributed to you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, helping us hand out sweetcakes. Our current level of popularity is something that could never have been attained without people like you."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"More than that, it is my fans we must thank for coming to our performances! Though, I'm far from satisfied. This is only the beginning! We're not stopping until we're the best in Eorzea."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Th–The best in Eorzea!? Wow, Ulala, do you truly think it can happen?"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Think it can happen? I <span class=\"emphasis\">know</span> it will happen. You've heard the lecture before. As <span class=\"emphasis\">someone</span> never fails to remind us, the key to success is practice, practice, and more practice!"},{"name":"Q2","text":"Who would you like to speak with?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Ulala."},{"name":"A2","text":"Narumi."},{"name":"A2","text":"Masha."},{"name":"A2","text":"No one."},{"name":"Q3","text":"What would you like to ask?"},{"name":"A3","text":"How did you become a Songbird?"},{"name":"A3","text":"What are your interests?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Tell me something about your family."},{"name":"A3","text":"What are your aspirations for the future?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Cancel."},{"name":"A3","text":"(Locked) What are your interests?"},{"name":"A3","text":"(Locked) Tell me something about your family."},{"name":"A3","text":"(Locked) What are your aspirations for the future?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To access this content, you must first help the Songbirds gain recognition from the citizens of Ul'dah. These answers will continue to unlock as the girls become more popular."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Complete the quest “Sugar, Spice, and Everything Rice” as often as you like to help raise the Songbirds' popularity and make the Little Ladies' Day festival enjoyable for everyone!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"When I heard from a friend that the royal seneschal was looking to cast people for an ensemble of sorts, I promptly rushed over to the Sapphire Avenue Exchange to secure my place on the register!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Honestly, what choice did I have? With my good looks and bell-like voice, I was born to be a star!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"While I was unable to find him on my first try, I set out for the Exchange every day thereafter and finally came across him on my tenth trip. It was all smooth sailing from there!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"My father is a merchant from the Far East and I accompanied him to Ul'dah as his apprentice. It was during one of my routine runs to and from the marketplace that I encountered the royal seneschal."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Initially, I turned down his offer, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was the perfect opportunity for me to overcome my bashfulness through the two things I love most─singing and dancing!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Being the traditional man that he is, my father was opposed to my decision. It took a while but I eventually managed to convince him to let me try my luck with the Little Ladies' Day festival. I think you already know what happened from there!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"My dance troupe and I would often perform in front of the Gate of the Sultana. One day, during an intermission, the royal seneschal approached me."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"He praised me to the skies, saying I had great talent, and offered me a place with the Songbirds. I wasn't interested, but his honeyed words eventually won me over."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"It was a real struggle in the beginning─since singing isn't my strong suit─but life is about the challenge! Nobody worth half their salt has gotten to where they are without pushing their limits...or so my mother always says."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"It goes without saying that I love to sing and dance. Outside of that, I spend most of my free time reading... What? There's no need to look so astonished!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Most recently, I read a transcription of one of the wandering minstrel's tales about a powerful black mage. A friend from the Ossuary recommended it to me. It was so interesting, I devoured it all in one sitting!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"As much as I enjoy reading, I also love spending time outdoors wandering the town! In fact, just the other night Masha, Narumi, and I went down to the Sapphire Avenue Exchange to browse the markets for tiny trinkets and shiny new accessories!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"A very good question, indeed! Well, for one, I love trying new foods! This may come as a surprise, but I have a fairly big appetite. Even now, Ulala refuses to believe how much I will eat!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"I know, I know, but no happiness beats that of a full stomach─especially if you've just had yourself a large helping of dhalmel gratin!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"What else? Obviously I love to sing, even when I'm offstage. It's funny how easy it is to forget all your worries when you start humming a little tune! I suggest you try it the next time you're feeling glum."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Interests? There's nothing I love more than dancing, whether I'm doing it myself or watching someone else. Even if they don't realize it, everyone has their own signature move and that's what makes it such a beautiful art!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Maybe you've heard but one of the most popular choreographists from the Gold Saucer will be releasing a book for the <span class=\"emphasis\">Ballroom Etiquette</span> series. Gah! I don't know how I'll pay for one, but I simply must get my hands on a copy!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"I suppose there's only one thing for me to do. It looks like I'll need to sneak my way into a “The Time of My Life” event down at the Gold Saucer. If I can perform as well as last time, I should win enough MGP to both buy the book and have some left to spare!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Seeing as I'm small and have such a winsome smile, everyone often mistakes me for the baby of the family but I actually have a little brother. Aside from him, it's just me and my parents."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"As my father always likes to tell anyone who will listen, he met my mother on a rainy evening when he was in Ul'dah for work. It was love at first sight, and not long after that fateful day, church bells filled the air and they were married! Romantic, isn't it?"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"I'm a fairly versatile person, so even as a child I would always help out around the house by doing the cooking, cleaning, and sewing. Without me, I honestly don't know how my family would have managed!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Why don't you visit us sometime? My parents always love having guests over!"},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Aside from me, it's just my mother and father. Growing up as an only child could be lonely at times, so I'm terribly jealous of Ulala and Masha."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Being from the Far East, Father would always be forced to travel for work, often leaving me alone with Mother."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"It was on my last nameday that my father decided I was old enough to begin accompanying him on his business excursions. Never had I thought that in traveling with him I'd find a place on the stages of Ul'dah!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"I grew up in a household as the third daughter of five. As you likely already know, we Keepers of the Moon are not raised with a father, so it was just my mother with us at home."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"Now, of course, I live on my own. After one of my older sisters moved to Ul'dah, I decided to follow her example and leave the Black Shroud."},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"It was only later I discovered she had run off with a man of debatable character, running an equally dubious business in the city. That said, I'm not in any position to judge, as my current job isn't something most would consider “decent work.”"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Well, that's an obvious one, isn't it? My dream is to become the greatest singer in all of Eorzea─nay─the realm!"},{"name":"ULALA","text":"Don't look at me like that! While this doesn't make anything I said earlier any less true, I will admit I'm also actually quite satisfied with things as they are now."},{"name":"ULALA","text":"There really is nothing more I could ask for. Every day I move a step closer to becoming the singer I've always wanted to be, with two of my best friends at my side. I suppose, in a way, that's the true dream."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"I'd love to someday join a theater troupe...but I doubt anyone would ever take me on."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"Where I'm from, we have a unique take on the art, and going to the theater to watch the productions that would be put on was one of my favorite things to do with my mother when I was younger."},{"name":"NARUMI","text":"It's funny that the idea of acting appeals to me so much now because up until I joined the Songbirds, even the thought of standing center stage would have left me queasy!"},{"name":"MASHAMHAKARACCA","text":"My dream?
