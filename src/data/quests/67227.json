Though she would continue her lesson, the hour is late and her duties call. Before she leaves, Heustienne extends to you an invitation to visit the home of the dragoons. Make your way back to Ishgard and meet your pupil before the entrance of the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly.","You arrive at the Congregation's entrance to find Heustienne with her father, Montorgains, a retired dragoon. After her father takes his leave, Heustienne opens up to you about her past. You learn that she is a war orphan, and became a dragoon that she might honor her adoptive father. The tale concludes with Heustienne remembering that Ser Alberic wished a word with you. Take yourself to the Observatorium at your earliest convenience.","You learn more of Heustienne's past from Ser Alberic. Possessed of tremendous potential, she had once vied to become the Azure Dragoon. Alas, the Eye chose her rival, Estinien, and she has since taken to training with a fervor bordering on self-punishment. Ser Alberic bids you keep watch over her, lest she lose sight of her conviction and render herself vulnerable to the enemy's wiles.<br><br>※The next dragoon quest will be available from Alberic upon reaching level 54."],"objectives":["Speak with Heustienne at the Congregation.","Speak with Alberic at the Observatorium."],"dialogue":[{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"...A way to draw out your comrades' strength? Such an approach had never occurred to me."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"And small wonder, perhaps, for we dragoons are taught to be relentless in offense. In order to bring down dragons, we strive to jump higher and strike harder."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"But in my single-minded pursuit of what I believed to be perfection, 'twould seem I ended up fighting only with my lance. So focused was I upon delivering that next blow, I rendered myself blind to other possibilities."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"You have opened my eyes, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. If I am to transcend my limits, 'tis plain I must cast aside my preconceptions."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Ah, but the hour grows late. I must needs return to the Congregation. Would you care to accompany me? It may interest you to see how your fellow dragoons live."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Have confidence, my friend. I have no doubt that you will make a fine mentor for Heustienne."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Welcome to the home of the dragoons. I had a mind to show you the premises, but my father has paid me a sudden visit."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"This is my father, Montorgains. Father, allow me to present to you my mentor, the Azure Dragoon <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"MONTORGAINS","text":"'Tis an honor and a pleasure both to make your acquaintance. I hope you will forgive me for inconveniencing your plans, but what is a father to do? Dedicated to her duties as she is, my daughter scarcely comes home, and so I must go to her."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Father, please, we have spoken about this. I but strive to be a dragoon worthy of the name, as you yourself were. All that I do, I do to honor you."},{"name":"MONTORGAINS","text":"My child, you would honor me best by taking care of yourself. Well, I shan't overstay my welcome─seeing you hale and hearty is enough. Till next time."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"He is so kind to me, even though I share not his blood... Like so many others, I was orphaned by the war. I would have died long ago, cold and alone, had he not found me and taken me in. All that I have, I owe to him."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"'Twas for no other reason than to honor my father that I followed in his footsteps and became a dragoon. But if I am to live up to his legacy─if I am to protect Ishgard as he once did─I must needs grow stronger."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"And I <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span>, under your sage guidance. I look forward to our lessons to come."},{"name":"HEUSTIENNE","text":"Ah, it nigh slipped my mind: Ser Alberic wished a word with you. Pray seek him out at the Observatorium at your earliest convenience, perhaps after you have had a wander inside the Congregation."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"My thanks for coming, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. 'Tis no urgent matter─I was but wondering about Heustienne's progress. Tell me, how fares her training?"},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"So you have met her father. In his day, Montorgains was a dragoon of no small renown. He served Ishgard with valor until he took a grievous wound and was forced to hang up his lance."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"As Heustienne herself told you, she follows in her father's footsteps. From the first, she exhibited tremendous potential. In all ways, she was Estinien's equal, and the rivalry they shared raised both of them higher."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"Alas, the Eye chose Estinien, and not her. Since then, she has taken to training with a fervor which borders on self-punishment."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"It is well to strive for greater heights, but a dragoon must never lose sight of his conviction. It is the only thing that shields us from the dragons' wiles."},{"name":"ALBERIC","text":"So I beg you, keep watch over Heustienne. By your shining example, see to it she never forgets what it means to be a dragoon."}],"reward":{"gil":876,"xp":26400},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":52,"id":23}],"quests":[67226]},"next":[67228]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1013445","obj":{"i":1013445,"n":"Heustienne","l":2200,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1006748","obj":{"i":1006748,"n":"Alberic","l":63,"q":17}},{"type":"npc","id":"1013448","obj":{"i":1013448,"n":"Heustienne","l":2300,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67226","obj":{"i":67226,"n":"Days of Azure","g":150,"l":"Coerthas Central Highlands","s":520,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"67228","obj":{"i":67228,"n":"Sworn Upon a Lance","g":150,"l":"Coerthas Central Highlands","s":540,"f":1}}]}
