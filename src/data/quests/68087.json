I look forward to learning why it was so imperative that we remain ignorant of the device's precise function."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"They used medicines to keep me in a torpor for much of the time. I...fear I am still recovering from their effects. But I will be fine. I will."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"Can you believe it? Not only did we secure the residential district, but we captured Fordola! Wait till the Flame General hears about this!"},{"name":"WISCAR","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; Looks like it wasn't my day to die. I owe you one, Meffrid..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Lyse has gone to deliver Fordola into the custody of the Alliance, leaving M'naago and her men to hold the residential district and stand ready."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Once the Alliance has breached the main gates and commenced their assault, the Resistance forces will push through the entrance here and join the fray."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"In that case, I will remain here. My search for Krile took me into the city proper, and my familiarity with their defenses may prove useful to the Resistance."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Understood. I shall instruct Arenvald and his unit to render support as well."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"They were tasked with securing the aetheryte, as I recall. With me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"THANCRED","text":"Brave though they may be, these freedom fighters will need every advantage if they are to defeat their oppressors. I will do what I can to tip the odds in their favor."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"I didn't know what had become of Arenvald and the others after I was taken. It's such a relief to see them hale and healthy."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"This aetheryte is perhaps the most strategically important landmark here, as it can serve as a gateway for attuned troops with sufficient anima. Such tactics are not without their risks, however..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Were the imperials to discover that the aetheryte was being used in such a fashion, they might turn their artillery upon us─destroying the beacon and the better part of the district, at the cost of countless civilian lives..."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"You can count on us, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"WISCAR","text":"Don't you worry─I'm under no illusions. I was lucky to survive back there. I'll have to work harder and train longer if I'm going to stay alive."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Gods, Krile... It's so good to see you. I feared the worst..."},{"name":"KRILE","text":"It wasn't your fault. You saved me─all of you. Thank you."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We will be departing shortly for Porta Praetoria to rejoin the main host."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Arenvald, I would have your unit remain here with Thancred, that you might support the Resistance troops in the coming battle."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Understood! We won't let you down."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...I trust you will refrain from doing anything I would not. We are both far too young to die."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Right, right─no noble sacrifices! Got it!"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, Krile─let us be off, then."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Thank the Twelve she's all right. I don't know what I would have done..."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"Well done securing the residential district! Ala Mhigo is nearly ours!"},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"The Matron smiles upon us this day with the safe return of you and your captured comrade. Such tidings are sure to raise the men's spirits."},{"name":"VMAHTIA","text":"Krile is safe, and the Ala Mhigan Quarter secure. We could not have hoped for a better outcome."},{"name":"JMOLDVA","text":"It is far, far too early to celebrate. Zenos is not finished with us yet."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I prithee proceed with the utmost caution, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. If there be truth in Fordola's words, and the viceroy is indeed possessed of a power “echoing that of the eikons,” then still greater strength shall be required to bring about his defeat."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"As I said, there is but one path forward. We take Ala Mhigo, and with it, Zenos's head."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"Heh heh, I can't wait to see Marshal Slafyrsyn in action! His Maelstrike is the stuff of legends!"},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"I must admit, my Lominsan counterpart's enthusiasm is...infectious. I find that I too am eager to see this so-called “Maelstrike” firsthand."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"If I may, General─is there aught <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> and I can do to assist with final preparations?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I'm glad you asked. Pipin informed me moments ago that all forces are in position and that we are ready to commence the assault."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Naught remains but to notify the Alliance commanders. If you've no objections, I should be glad to have you do the honors, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span></span><span class=\"alternative\">[GC Rank]</span></span>."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"You were instrumental to the success of Operation Archon. You helped bring an end to the Dragonsong War. You are a hero to the people and a symbol of hope."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Some might judge it an empty gesture, or worse a waste of your talents, but I know it would mean much to everyone here."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"'Tis one thing to hear the tales, another to look upon the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman herself</span><span class=\"alternative\">man himself</span></span>. Now is the time to remind our comrades that they are not alone."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"The General makes a good point. The Warrior of Light's worth may be measured not only by what <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> does, but by what <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> inspires others to do."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"All is ready? Very well. Though many will fall in the coming battle, how many more shall know liberty for their sacrifice."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"There is a time for peace, and a time for war. Even the Matron understands this. We who have received of Hers and the elementals' blessings go now to stand for Eorzea and her children."},{"name":"BODYGUARD01623","text":"The Elder Seedseer saw fit to grant me mercy at Carteneau. Perhaps, if the opportunity allows, we may offer the same to my former comrades...but if not, then so be it."},{"name":"KANESENNA","text":"Matron forgive us for what we must do."},{"name":"MERLWYB","text":"It's time, then. Though this is not my theater of choice, we will play our part. Our cannons care not either way."},{"name":"MERLWYB","text":"That battery has sunk enough ships to fill a fleet. 'Tis not like to be bested by a gate."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"'Tis rare these days that I am granted leave to take the field. Mayhap I should have brought my mask..."},{"name":"MERLWYB","text":"They are fine gates, no doubt. And they will make fine slag."},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"Hah! That you should be the one to bring me word. By the Fury, it is good to see you, my friend."},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"You, who stood with us in our direst hour, will ever be an inspiration to my countrymen─and to me. Though Ishgard's debt can never be repaid, it is my hope that our deeds this day shall go some small way to redressing the balance."},{"name":"LUCIA","text":"Zenos has never cared a whit for politics. He lives for war and war alone. Kill him, or he will kill you."},{"name":"AYMERIC","text":"Several times you defended our gates. Let us return the favor by demolishing theirs."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"It is done, then? Thank you, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\"><span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span></span><span class=\"alternative\">[GC Rank]</span></span>...for humoring an old bull."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"Maelstrom, Adder, and Ishgardian forces are in position, General!"},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"Resistance forces in the Ala Mhigan Quarter are ready and await our signal."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Naught left to do but the deed itself."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I have asked Urianger to look after Krile. He will keep her out of harm's way. Though, after what she has endured, her physical well-being may be the least of our worries..."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Worry not for her safety. Look thee to the east."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"Hah hah!
