Between his peculiar fixation on your digits and assorted ramblings, you have sufficient information to determine that the Skysteel Manufactory is in search of one skilled in tradecraft or the like─though to what end is unclear. You will need to speak with Neillemard if you hope to learn more.","At the Skysteel Manufactory, the thankfully straightforward Neillemard introduces to you the project that he, along with his fellow engineers Nimie and Denys, hope to bring to fruition in the name of contributing to efforts at the Firmament. Their aim is to perfect several prototype field and tradecraft tools unearthed from the manufactory's storehouse, and they require the assistance of a person skilled in such crafts to test and help improve said tools. Given that you are such a person, you agree to help─and with no further ado receive an eminently serviceable prototype for your trouble."],"objectives":["Speak with Neillemard at the Skysteel Manufactory."],"dialogue":[{"name":"STUDIOCRAFTSMAN03848","text":"You there, my good <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">lady</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>─if you don't mind my saying so, you have the look of one skilled with <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> hands.

You must possess deft fingers indeed for Lord Stephanivien to have taken such an immediate liking to you."},{"name":"STUDIOCRAFTSMAN03848","text":"Yes! You are a hero of some repute, are you not? Your prowess goes beyond the handling of common tools, then!"},{"name":"STUDIOCRAFTSMAN03848","text":"That is well, for we at the Skysteel Manufactory are in search of like-minded and nimble-fingered individuals!"},{"name":"STUDIOCRAFTSMAN03848","text":"Of course, said personage would also need to be familiar with Ishgard's efforts to restore its more material legacies.

Nothing would get done around here without me."},{"name":"A2","text":"Yes, I agreed to help Lord Francel."},{"name":"STUDIOCRAFTSMAN03848","text":"Better and better! We simply must have you."},{"name":"STUDIOCRAFTSMAN03848","text":"But─no. It is unbecoming of me to be so forward. I will say only this─if I have struck within you some spark of interest, you would do well to speak with Neillemard."},{"name":"STUDIOCRAFTSMAN03848","text":"You really ought to speak with Neillemard at the manufactory.

And wouldn't you know it, we found a whole pile of tools, just sitting there with all of the junk."},{"name":"NIMIE","text":"Judging by the plans they were heaped on top of, they're only prototypes─but they're fine things nonetheless."},{"name":"NIMIE","text":"If we could improve them, turn them into the masterworks they were meant to be...
