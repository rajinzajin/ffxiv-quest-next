Reports of the primal's most recent attack suggest that this incarnation of Leviathan is possessed of truly nightmarish power and represents a threat that must be neutralized with all possible haste. As soon as your preparations are complete, make your way to the Moraby Drydocks and speak with Sergeant Styrnlona.","Sergeant Styrnlona eagerly informs you that the twin vessel, the <span class=\"emphasis\">Whorleater</span>, and its towing ship are ready to leave port as soon as you board.

'Twas a deed both heroic and historic─a tale to be told down the ages."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"I fear, however, that the terror of the Indigo Deep did slumber but briefly in the aetherial sea. The Maelstrom hath assured me with unhappy certitude that Leviathan doth stir from the abyss once more."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"Should this indeed prove the case, then we face a most troubling and chilling predicament. The Lord of the Whorl is a voracious being─naught less than a treasure trove of crystals would serve to lure the entity back to our plane of existence."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"'Tis folly, then, to believe the sea-bound beastmen could gather such a haul with such impossible alacrity. No, we must assume the Sahagin have adopted the disturbing new summoning ritual we observed amongst the other beast tribes."},{"name":"URIANGER","text":"'Tis folly, then, to believe the sea-bound beastmen could gather such a haul with such impossible alacrity.
