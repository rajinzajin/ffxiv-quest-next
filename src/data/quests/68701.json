Tataru too is needed, but it seems the collective has already taken the initiative and summoned her themselves...","As feared, the mad auspice that could single-handedly transform the Ruby Sea into a fiery hellscape is poised to return at any moment. The only means by which this calamity might possibly be averted is through the combined powers of the Four Lords, and to that end, you must quell the aramitama of the fourth and arguably most powerful member: Seiryu. The serpentine dragon, who appears to be in full possession of his faculties, agrees to face you in mortal combat, albeit on a distant island he calls home. To that end, you must first journey to the Isle of Bekko in the Ruby Sea, and from there set forth to the chosen battleground with the aid of Genbu.","Before you depart for his island, Seiryu reflects on the fallen samurai Tenzen, who bested him in single combat long ago. On that fateful day, he vowed to train tirelessly that he might claim victory in a future rematch, but was denied the opportunity to do so. And so he found a new purpose in striving to destroy the fiend that robbed the Four Lords of Tenzen: Koryu. Alas, in order to do so, he intends to embrace the aramitama and become a demon to destroy another. Though deeply troubling, your objective is unchanged─you and your adventurer comrades must band together and defeat the legendary auspice.<br><br>※The Wreath of Snakes can be accessed via the Duty Finder.","Dangerous and deadly though he was, Seiryu was ultimately no match for you and yours. His soul now at peace, the auspice appears to be in a rather more contemplative mood than before...","Long, long ago, Seiryu was regarded as a great kami by the people of an island, who offered him gifts. When visited by calamity, however, they mistook him as the cause and began to offer their own children as sacrifices, who Seiryu would spirit away to other lands and set free in secret. And so, over the years, his worshipers slowly became his decriers, believing him less a guardian spirit and more a malevolent demon. Accordingly, they turned to sellswords, whom they plied with coin to come and slay the serpent, until Tenzen came and defeated him in single combat, only to then offer him a place at his side, along with three other fantastic beasts who would comprise the remainder of the Four Lords. As he thinks on those halcyon days, Seiryu recalls that he was not so much driven to surpass Tenzen, but rather to become an auspice worthy of man's worship─a magnificent dragon that would safeguard his chosen. A noble aspiration briefly forgotten, perhaps due to the influence of the aramitama..."],"objectives":["Speak with Genbu in Reisen Temple.","Speak with Seiryu in the Ruby Sea.","Confront Seiryu in the Wreath of Snakes.","Speak with Seiryu."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BUNCHIN","text":"Passing through, or here for another reason?

Then let us proceed."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"You weren't exaggerating, were you? About Koryu's wards?"},{"name":"GENBU","text":"Would that I were.

I was certain we had more time to prepare..."},{"name":"GENBU","text":"Bah! Worrying over my mistake will avail us nothing. Only the strength of the Four Lords united will see us through this crisis.

Will you do this for us, brave warrior?"},{"name":"GENBU","text":"I doubted not that you would agree, but am nevertheless relieved."},{"name":"GENBU","text":"The last of our quartet is perhaps the most formidable among us, for in battle he commands a great host of shiki.

You need wait no longer."},{"name":"GENBU","text":"You are come sooner than expected, comrade.

You are...not unlike him. That much is plain."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Tenzen too was possessed of a quiet confidence─a well-deserved one at that. When he met his foes in battle, blade in hand, he was...magnificent..."},{"name":"GENBU","text":"As well you should know, having been bested by him in single combat. Which was why you chose to join us, was it not?"},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Aye.

Before it is too late and you fall to the primal rage and become a broken shell! Like Koryu!"},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Think you I know not what is at stake!? If I must become a demon to slay another, then I do so gladly! My vow demands it!"},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Only by embracing the aramitama will we ever rid ourselves of Koryu. This I know.

Hardly surprising, given that you fought Byakko and Suzaku."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Then we shall forgo further debate, and let the battle determine who is right...and who is dead."},{"name":"GENBU","text":"This is indeed a troubling development. In embracing the aramitama, the shiki he commands may pose a far greater threat..."},{"name":"GENBU","text":"Nevertheless, our purpose is unchanged. You must show him the error of his ways, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, and save him from his primal rage!"},{"name":"GENBU","text":"This seems a secluded enough place for us to speak. Excellent."},{"name":"TATARU","text":"Don't you worry! This urchin has everything under control!"},{"name":"GENBU","text":"Whenever you are ready, I will deliver you and your fellow adventurers to Seiryu's lair. You did remember to gather your fellow adventurers, did you not?"},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"You are every bit Tenzen's successor, warrior, for you are but the second child of man to have bested me in battle..."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Once, I would have never thought it possible. When I was no more than a mere serpent blessed with the good fortune to be born on an island where the people held us in the highest. To them, I was as kami, and I was foolish enough to share in their belief."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"But when I had lived some few centuries, and first began to manifest true powers, my worshipers came to view me in a different light..."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"When they were visited by calamity, they mistook me as the cause. And so, in place of traditional offerings, they brought me the flesh of their flesh."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Though I had no hand in it, their fortunes improved. To them, the answer was clear: only greater sacrifice would satisfy the guardian serpent. Little did they know I had spared the maiden and spirited her away to another land, in secret, as I would the others that would follow..."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Nevertheless, the belief lingered...and soon the guardian serpent came to be regarded as a malevolent demon, and my worshipers became my decriers."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"They tempted sellswords with koban to come and slay me, the poor fools. So began my days as a hunted kami."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"I dispatched them every time, though I took little joy in it. And then, one day, a man unlike all the others appeared before me. A samurai in the company of beasts."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Tenzen and I fought. He won. The fallen kami had at last been bested by a fortune-seeking hunter. I could not help but chuckle as I closed my eyes and awaited the inevitable blow..."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"\"Join me. Let us begin anew.“ Saying this, he extended his hand to me."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"All that I was, all that I had ever been was no more. I had nothing...yet not only did he see fit to spare me, but offer me a new home."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"But even a fallen kami has his pride, and I could not readily accept such kindness, even if I yearned for it. Seeing this, Tenzen laughed..."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"\"Then earn it by growing stronger and in turn using that strength to help others, as you have been helped. Become more than you are─and more than me.“"},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Thus did I vow to devote myself to becoming an auspice worthy of man's worship and admiration. To become a magnificent dragon that would safeguard his chosen."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Strange...my recollection now is not as it was before. Details once indistinct are now vivid and clear. Perhaps the aramitama clouded my judgment..."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Had you not helped me to remember my vow, I might have lost the chance to honor Tenzen's memory forever."},{"name":"SEIRYU","text":"Wait─where is Genbu? Has he returned to the temple without us?
