Furthermore, in recognition of her efforts, she has received an invitation to perform at the annual Kugane-odori, known as the event where stars of the flower district are made. Not all is well, however─as Keimei tells it, his butterfly is acting curiously despondent despite the joyous news, going so far as to refuse his offer to commission a new dress for her to commemorate the occasion. At the young master's behest, you make for the flower district in hopes of finding out what troubles the girl and easing her heart as best you can.","A brief heart-to-heart with Kotocho sheds light upon the nature of her plight. The girl tearfully describes how her sole source of comfort as she toiled and struggled was her dream that she would once again stand on the same stage as Kototsuru, and finally prove her worth to her mentor and role model. Though the butterfly has risen back through the ranks, Kototsuru's impending marriage and retirement from the flower district means this dream will not come to be. Unable to summon the passion she once had, Kotocho asks to be left alone with her thoughts. At a loss, you acquiesce to the girl's request and head back to share what you have learned with Master Keimei.","You share what you have learned with Keimei, who is quickly spurred to action. As Kotocho's patron, he reaffirms his vow to support the girl in this, her time of greatest need. To that end, he would take it upon himself to convince Kototsuru to put off her planned retirement until after she has taken part in one final performance. You make for the artisans' quarter, determined to assist in whatever what you can.","The heartfelt pleas of Master Keimei and yourself do not fall on deaf ears, and Kototsuru agrees to your request. She does, however, set one absolute condition: the two geiko must perform the same number─an ancient Doman dance known as the tennyo-no-mai, or descent of the angel─while wearing identical dresses, which you are to fashion. Believing this the only way to raise Kotocho's spirits, the two of you thank Kototsuru for her kindness before returning to Daitenya to prepare the ancient garment─the tennyo hagoromo─needed for the occasion.","Upon your return to Daitenya, Keimei tells Kotocho the news, renewing her vigor and encouraging her to resume training. He further explains that he has prepared the finest silks at his disposal for what will doubtless prove to be your most significant and challenging work to date. When you are ready to brandish your needle, you need only speak with the stall attendant and claim the fabrics you desire.","As he hands over the squares of pristine, angelic silks, the attendant muses on how the choice of dance is truly fitting for Kototsuru's final performance, given her deep respect for cultural tradition, and a worthy challenge for the young Kotocho as well. It would seem all are eager to see past, present, and future come together on the stage at the Kugane-odori. You take your needle in hand, vowing to create twin masterpieces worthy of the grand occasion.<br><br>※In the event you lose the ingredients or the synthesis ends in failure, you may try again by speaking with Yagiri.","After presenting your work to Master Keimei, you make your way to the festivities just as Kototsuru and Kotocho are about to take the stage. Together with the young master, you look on in wonder as the two geiko twirl and sway in perfect harmony, as if their two physical bodies shared a single soul. You wake from this otherworldly dream to welcome the two, who thank you profusely for crafting the garments so sublime it was as if they were truly transformed into heavenly beings. They share a moment of tenderness as Kotocho thanks her mentor for all that she has done, and Kototsuru entrusts the future of the flower district to her erstwhile apprentice. You and Keimei look on warmly as the two geiko reaffirm a bond that will surely last for the rest of their lives, even as their paths diverge.","Your work done, you pay one final visit to Daitenya, where Master Keimei expresses his deep appreciation for all that you have done on his and Kotocho's behalf. He expresses his confidence that the flower district is in good hands with his butterfly, and wishes you a safe journey back to Eorzea, where he hopes that Hingan fashions might one day make an impression the way your craftsmanship has found an audience in his homeland."],"objectives":["Speak with Kotocho.","Report to Keimei.","Search for Kototsuru.","Speak with Keimei.","Obtain the needed materials from Yagiri.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Craft tennyo hagoromo <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"></span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the tennyo hagoromo <img class=\"hq-icon small\" src=\"images/item/hq.png\"> to Keimei</span></span>.","Speak with Keimei."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>, I have the most wonderful news: our butterfly is a geiko once more! They say Kotocho devoted herself to even the most menial of her tasks with such diligence that she quickly won over even the strictest of her seniors."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"She will make her triumphant return at the Kugane-odori: the greatest spectacle in our fair city, where veteran geiko and fledgling maiko alike take the stage in a vivid display of all the cultural riches the Hanamachi has to offer."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"The festivities are held once each year, and as tradition goes, the geiko who earns the highest acclaim takes her place atop the flower district until such time as she is dethroned at a future event. As you might imagine, Kototsuru has held that position since...well, since as long as I can remember."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"There has, however, been a most unexpected turn of events. Just the other day, Kototsuru announced that she will not only be withdrawing from the festivities, but retiring from the Hanamachi altogether. Rumor has it that she is to be wed."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"The suddenness of it all has the flower district in state of disarray. That said, this could very well be the chance of a lifetime for our butterfly! So I thought, at least─yet for reasons I cannot comprehend, when I asked what she would wear this time, she simply lowered her head and walked away."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"It is entirely unlike the girl to be so glum on the eve of what very well might be the chance of a lifetime. Is it possible she harbors a worry that she is ashamed to discuss with me? I cannot say, but I would be ever so grateful if you could talk with her in my stead."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"It simply isn't like Kotocho to brood and repine like this. The girl refuses to open her heart to me, but perhaps you might succeed where I have not."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"Oh, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. Have you come to congratulate me on my promotion? You are always so kind. Sadly, I am afraid I'm not much in the mood for celebration."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"Thank you, friend, but you have heard the news, yes? Kototsuru is leaving the Hanamachi, never to return. However can this be...?"},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"It embarrasses me to say this, but were it not for Kototsuru, I would not be the geiko I am today. As a child, I saw her twirl across the stage at the Kugane-odori, and it moved me as nothing I had seen before. In that instant, I <span class=\"emphasis\">knew</span>─I would give anything to dance beside her one day."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"At the bugyo's banquet, my dream was finally realized. In the end, my performance was not worthy of sharing the same stage. And yet still, deep down, the little girl inside me was giddy as could be."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"This is what sustained me as I scrubbed the floors and folded the kimono of girls years my junior─knowing that if I did what was asked of me, the day would come that I could once more stand next to she who taught me everything, and this time prove my true worth!"},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"...But now that day will never come. And so I have told the young master I will have need of his gifts no longer. To take the stage with this empty heart would only bring shame to him─and to the flower district itself."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"You have been most kind to me, but I would be alone with my thoughts for a while. Tell Master Keimei I am sorry."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"I know not what path I will walk from here, but I would be alone with my thoughts for a while. Pray forgive me."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Oh, thank the kami you return! You have spoken with my butterfly, yes? What is it that pains her?"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"...I see. Without her rival and role model to bring her focus, Kotocho has lost the will to go on. The poor girl...why must she torture herself so?"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"That said, it is quite like her. Once she has set her mind to something, she is not easily swayed by the words of others. It can be one of her most endearing qualities─and, at times like this, one of her most frustrating."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"As the girl's patron, it is my duty to support her in any way I am able. To this point, this has mostly taken the form of tangible gifts, but it would seem my butterfly requires a different sort of favor from us this day."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. Might you be so kind as to accompany me to speak with Kototsuru?

I will be along as soon as I have seen to matters around the shop. Thank you, my friend."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Kototsuru may seem cold on the surface, but deep down she has a soft spot for her former apprentice. Surely there is hope for us yet!"},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"Well, if it isn't the adventurer that fool child is always imposing on. Whatever brings you here?"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Kototsuru, you must hear us out! A young girl's very life hangs in the balance!"},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"Must you always be so dramatic? You are free to make your plea. Though I, of course, am free to deny it."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"I beg of you, Kototsuru. Pray postpone your retirement, if only for a fortnight. Say that you will dance at the Kugane-odori one last time!"},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"Forgive me, but I believe this life is my own to live. To tell the truth, I have already put off my marriage quite long enough. Though I am getting no younger, I could not very well leave the Hanamachi without knowing I had a worthy successor, one who could lead the flower district for years to come."},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"...But things are different now. There is, at last, one who could follow in my footsteps. She is already a favorite of the crowds, and though once she stumbled, she has risen again, with newfound humility to temper her passion. I would step aside and let her take center stage."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Meanwhile, the girl of whom you speak is saying that she may never dance again! This is why we have come to you, Kototsuru. You must help us save our butterfly!"},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"Whatever would you need of me? You are her patron, are you not? It is you and <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span> who have supported her through her most taxing trials, not I."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You are what she herself strives to be."},{"name":"A1","text":"You are the one who gave her a dream."},{"name":"A1","text":"Nothing."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"We may be her patrons and her friends, but you, Kototsuru─you are the one she always looked up to, and what she herself one day would be. The girl has come far, but she is still a girl. Without you to guide her─to challenge her to be more than who she is today─she is as good as lost."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"It is true that we have spared no effort to help the girl realize her dream. But were it not for you, Kototsuru, that dream would never have been born. Without you to guide her─to challenge her to be more than who she is today─she is as good as lost."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"If you would, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>...allow me."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Kototsuru. You are the one who gave the girl her dream, and what she herself would one day be. Without you to guide her─to challenge her to be more than who she is today─she is as good as lost."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"One last chance to share the stage with her idol, to prove herself worthy─this is all my butterfly wants, and if she is deprived of it, it will haunt her for the rest of her days. We beg of you, Kototsuru! Do not abandon the child in her moment of need!"},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"You would propose another contest? Be forewarned that I would not take the challenge lightly. If I were to defeat her again, who is to say she would not flee the Hanamachi with her tail between her legs."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"If that is how it goes, it would only show that she was not ready to carry on your legacy after all. If that is the case, it is better you learn now rather than later, no?"},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"Indeed. Harsher words than I would expect to hear from you, Keimei, and yet there is truth in them. Very well. I will acquiesce to your request. You will see me on stage at the Kugane-odori─on one condition."},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"Kotocho and I will don the same dress, and dance the same dance...a dance of my choosing. We shall perform the ancient dance that came to Hingashi from Doma in days long past...the <span class=\"emphasis\">tennyo-no-mai</span>."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"The dance of an angel lured down from her sequestered home in the sky. But Doman custom dictates that all who dance the tennyo-no-mai must wear..."},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"...A tennyo hagoromo in the classic tradition, of course. Simply nothing else will do. Now, Master Keimei─I trust you will be seeing to my attire as well as that of your precious butterfly, yes?"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"B-But of course! It would be my─<span class=\"emphasis\">our</span> pleasure, right, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>? You may consider it a wedding present from the both of us to you."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"That said, this is quite unprecedented. I cannot recall the last time a dance of ancient Doma was performed at the Kugane-odori, much less a time when two leading geiko performed in identical garb. You seek to level the playing field─to ensure that this is a test of pure skill?"},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"Very astute, Keimei. For all your posturing, at times I look in your eyes and see the man who found me in the teahouses, who bought me my first kimono so many years ago..."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Father? Ahem. At any rate, consider all of your conditions accepted, Kototsuru. For all that you have done and will do for my butterfly...I thank you."},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"And with that, I should return to the flower district. I look forward to my present, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Well, that went about as well as could be expected. Still, we haven't any time to lose. Let us meet back at the shop─I will send for Kotocho."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"So we meet again. The young master asked me to come at once. The timing is curious, but it is just as well─there is something I must tell the both of you..."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"It would seem we are all here. Excellent. Kotocho, there is something you must know..."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"Wait, young master. Before that, there is something I would say as well─to both of you."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"You have been so gracious with me, lavishing upon me presents I scarce deserved. But I fear I can accept your patronage no longer. Whatever passion for my art I once had burns within me no longer. And so, I will be leaving the flower district...forever."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Wait, my sweet butterfly! Have you not heard the news!? Kototsuru has agreed to give one last performance at the Kugane-odori. What's more, she has issued a personal challenge to you!"},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"Wh-What? Could this be true...!?"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"She has, however, given her conditions: the two will perform as one the tennyo-no-mai, the dance of ancient Doma, and do so clad in identical tennyo hagoromo fashioned by <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>'s hand."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"Can my ears be believed...? I will not only share the same stage with Kototsuru, but don the same dress...and dance the same dance?"},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"Change of plans, young master─your butterfly will not be retiring after all! After all, we must send Kototsuru off in grand fashion, must we not? <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>, might I trouble you with one last commission?"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Those</span> are the eyes, burning with passion, that stole my heart that day! We stand by your side as ever, my butterfly. Pray show us the dance of your lifetime, and give Kototsuru the wedding present that only you could provide!"},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"Young master, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. Words cannot convey my gratitude for all you have done for me! I promise you that this time will be different. No, I will not shirk my training for even a moment. But what am I doing still here? I must begin at once!"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"This will be the final piece I ask of you, friend. I need not impress upon you the gravity of it all. For my part, I can assure you I have spared no expense in procuring the finest of materials."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Fabrics of the purest white, so pure one would think they were weaved by the angels themselves. White to symbolize Kototsuru's betrothal, and Kotocho's rebirth."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"A traditional garment of the East, it will doubtless be unlike any dress you have fashioned before. But I trust in your talent, and all you have learned since coming here to Kugane. I am most looking forward to seeing your hagoromo."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"I am heartened to see Kotocho in high spirits again. And I am sure those spirits will only rise higher when she takes the stage with Kototsuru clad in your latest and greatest creation."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"I am truly sorry for the burden, but I am counting on you, friend. We all are. If all goes well, this year's Kugane-odori will be the stuff of legend."},{"name":"YAGIRI","text":"Welcome back, friend. I trust you have come for the fabrics the young master has prepared. They are yours."},{"name":"YAGIRI","text":"The tennyo-no-mai, as Doman legend has it, was first danced to entice an angel down from a castle in the sky in which she had sequestered herself. It is a dance with a storied history─it is not surprising that Kototsuru, with her deep appreciation for tradition, would make such a choice."},{"name":"YAGIRI","text":"And yet, to my knowledge, it is rarely performed by two dancers in tandem. Doubtless Kototsuru is looking to give the audience at her final Kugane-odori the show of their lives."},{"name":"YAGIRI","text":"It would seem that the veteran has high hopes for Kotocho as well. But can the young butterfly truly live up to her mentor's demanding expectations? I, for one, will be on the edge of my seat."},{"name":"YAGIRI","text":"The face of the flower district's past, and─if all goes well─the face of its future, together on stage one last time. Throw your masterpiece-to-be in the mix, and I suspect this year's Kugane-odori will be a spectacle like none other."},{"name":"YAGIRI","text":"Your work is done? The young master will want to see it without delay!"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Is that what I think it is? I knew I could count on you, friend!"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"...Excellent. I would not spoil the moment by looking upon them here and now. No, I will deliver the dresses to the Hanamachi at once."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"You have my most sincere gratitude for all that you have done for us. Pray do not miss the festivities─I am quite certain it will be a spectacle for the ages."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Ah, there you are, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. Kotocho and Kototsuru are set to take the stage at any moment now."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Just <span class=\"emphasis\">look</span> at them, my friend. If such a thing were possible, I could swear that two angels, descended from the heavens, stand before our very eyes."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Every glance, every movement in perfect unison...it is as if the two of them breathe as one."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"Is this still our mortal world we live in? Pray pinch me, friend, that I might be certain I have not been spirited away to a land of dream and fancy..."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"...On second thought, stay your hand. For even if we were trapped in a fantasy─never to return whence we came─if I could watch these two for all eternity, I would gladly accept such a fate."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"I...I have no words for the beauty I just witnessed. It is as if I am lost in a dream from which I hope never to wake."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"You can thank <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span> for that. From the moment I wrapped myself in this hagoromo, it was as if I had truly transformed into an angel."},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"In all my years on the stage, I have never felt as I did this day. It was as if our bodies and souls were one─I knew not where one of us ended and the other began. And to think that I almost left the Hanamachi without ever having experienced the rapture of this night..."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"...Kototsuru. Forgive the headstrong, foolish girl you knew. And know that the woman who stands before you understands all that you have done for me through the years─and thanks you from the bottom of her heart."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"It would appear our contest has ended in a draw, but I would have it no other way. Once I dreamed of the day when I would surpass you, but today, a new dream is born inside of me."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"All that you have given me, I will share with those around me. The young master, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>, and all those in Kugane─citizen and wayfarer alike─who would honor me with their patronage."},{"name":"KOTOCHO","text":"The flower district will be in safe hands. Farewell, my dear sister, and may happiness fill the rest of your days."},{"name":"KOTOTSURU","text":"Thank you, my dear. But let us save the farewells for the proper occasion, shall we? Or is the shining star of the Hanamachi in such demand that she would refuse an invitation to perform at my ceremony?"},{"name":"YAGIRI","text":"Ah, but that was simply enchanting, was it not!? ...Oh. If you must know, I stole away from the stall for a moment to catch a glimpse of Kotocho and Kototsuru up close. You won't tell the young master, will you?"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mistress</span><span class=\"alternative\">Master</span></span> <span class=\"highlight\">Surname</span>. You truly outdid yourself this time. I have not the words to convey the full depths of my gratitude."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"With Kototsuru's retirement, the changing of the guard is complete. Kotocho will assume her place atop the ranks of the geiko, where she will lead the flower district into a new era. Great changes are coming, no doubt, but I am confident my butterfly is up to the task. After that ethereal performance, word has it all in the Hanamachi feel the same."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"I spoke with the girl just before you came. She says that, henceforth, she intends to perform in both the Eorzean dresses you fashioned for her, and the traditional kimono handed down to her by Kototsuru."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"In this way, she says, she would usher the flower district into the future, while taking care never to lose sight of the traditions of the past. Oh, how the girl has grown!"},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"...My apologies. It is unlike me to get so emotional. And this, I do believe, marks the most successful conclusion of our contract. Thank you, my friend, and rest assured that my butterfly will see that your sublime fashions do not go to waste."},{"name":"KEIMEI","text":"I do hope that your sojourn in Kugane has been a fruitful one. After all, mayhap your countrymen in Eorzea might take interest in Hingan fashions, as we have taken an interest in yours? But forgive me...this is but a humble suggestion. Till our paths cross again, safe travels, my friend!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In heightening your aesthetic sensibilities as a weaver, you have learned “Stroke of Genius”!"}],"reward":{"items":[{"id":5703},{"id":5708},{"id":5713}],"xp":0},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":14}],"quests":[67970]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1019811","obj":{"i":1019811,"n":"Keimei","l":2404,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019812","obj":{"i":1019812,"n":"Yagiri","l":2404,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019818","obj":{"i":1019818,"n":"Kotocho","l":2404,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019819","obj":{"i":1019819,"n":"Kototsuru","l":2404,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019820","obj":{"i":1019820,"n":"Kotocho","l":2404,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"5703","obj":{"i":5703,"n":"Craftsman's Competence Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":11,"attr":"Craftsmanship","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"5708","obj":{"i":5708,"n":"Craftsman's Cunning Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"CP","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"5713","obj":{"i":5713,"n":"Craftsman's Command Materia V","l":160,"c":20253,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":7,"attr":"Control","category":1}}},{"type":"item","id":"17923","obj":{"i":17923,"n":"Hagoromo Materials","l":290,"c":21603,"t":63}},{"type":"item","id":"17924","obj":{"i":17924,"n":"Tennyo Hagoromo","l":290,"c":42576,"t":63}},{"type":"quest","id":"67970","obj":{"i":67970,"n":"A Geiko for All Seasons","g":141,"l":"Kugane","s":680,"f":1}}]}
