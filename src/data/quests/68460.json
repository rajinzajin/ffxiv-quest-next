He then tells you to make for the Marauders' Guild in Limsa Lominsa, where the marauder-turned-Royal Marine awaits to disclose to you the relevant details.","According to Alka Zolka, the Brass Blades have managed to track down a creature resembling the description of the stowaway. Luckily for you, their quarry has slipped into the Black Shroud─an area that is outside of their jurisdiction. He then bids you to follow him to Camp Tranquil, where Setoto now likely is, and the two of you make ready to depart.","Alka Zolka reminds you that while the stowaway─who may well be Setoto─is safe from the Brass Blades, the forested area is just as dangerous for a lone tonberry. With precious little time to waste, it is decided the two of you will split up to conduct separate searches. Alka will check the northern part of the Black Shroud, while you scour the south.","You thoroughly investigate the area but you do not find Setoto. Mayhap it is time to move on and continue looking for the tonberry elsewhere.","Despite your best efforts, your search of this area turns up nothing. Perhaps searching the lands further north will yield better results.","You come across a tonberry lying facedown in the dirt surrounded by Coeurlclaw poachers. The pack of hunters are not at all pleased by your presence and warn you not to come any closer to them or their prey. Seeing as they intend to kill and skin the creature before them, it may be in your best interest to stop them.","The poachers are no match for you, and you swiftly dispatch of all three of them. Setoto, on the other hand, did not seem to fare nearly as well as you in her fight against them. Quickly cast Adloquium on her that she might be healed.","Shortly after casting Adloquium upon Setoto, you are joined by Alka Zolka, who is immediately enamored of the young tonberry girl. After commenting upon her beauty, he goes on to ask what motivated her to travel so far from her home in Bronze Lake. She tells you of how in the days before Nym's collapse her father was a scholar and Royal Marine. Suspecting he was captured by the Amdapori whilst on an undercover mission there, she sought to examine the ruins for anything that once belonged to him. Touched, Alka eagerly volunteers the both of you to aid her in her search. Return to Camp Tranquil with the tonberry girl and Alka to discuss how the three of you might proceed.","Alka Zolka will be returning once to Bronze Lake to inform Surito Carito of all that has happened. Before going, however, he makes Setoto promise that she will no longer wander about on her own and asks that you see that she gets plenty of rest in his absence. Once he returns and Setoto is fully recovered, the three of you will be leaving to search Amdapor Keep for a memento of Setoto's father.<br><br>※The next scholar quest will be available from Alka Zolka upon reaching level 65."],"objectives":["Speak with Alka Zolka at the Marauders' Guild.","Rendezvous with Alka Zolka at Camp Tranquil.","Survey the designated location.","Defeat the poachers.","Cast Adloquium on Setoto.","Speak with Alka Zolka at Camp Tranquil."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

"},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"He has uncovered information regarding Setoto's possible whereabouts and is currently waiting for you to join him at the Marauders' Guild in Limsa Lominsa. You best hurry."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Well come, my friend. My contacts have but recently caught wind of a rumor that the Brass Blades are once again on the move. It seems they have spotted a creature matching the description of the Vesper Bay stowaway."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Luckily for us, their quarry has fled into the Black Shroud─an area that is out of their jurisdiction."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"While there is still much we do not know, at least we now have an idea of where to begin. Let us immediately depart for Camp Tranquil!"},{"name":"SURITOCARITO","text":"Setoto, I pray that you are safe..."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"As you may well already know, the only way to reach the Black Shroud from Thanalan is to pass through this area. That means whoever─or whatever─the Brass Blades were pursuing entered the forests from here."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"If our hunch is correct and Setoto is in there, we best hurry. A tonberry who has seen little of the outside world would likely not last more than a few days on their own."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"To cover more ground in less time, I suggest we split up: I shall take the north, while you scour the south. Once we're done, let us meet back here."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Try as you might, you do not catch sight of Setoto or anything resembling the missing tonberry."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You spy a fallen figure, small of stature and green of skin. It's surrounded by poachers!"},{"name":"HUNTERA02924","text":"It looks like we've struck gold! Haha! If we skin and sell this thing, we're guaranteed a fortune!"},{"name":"HUNTERB02924","text":"Seven hells! Don't go celebrating just yet. We've got to kill it first.

When you didn't appear I began to grow worried and came looking for you. Good thing I did, too. Bloody poachers!"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Oh, but how rude of me. I nearly forgot to introduce myself. Hello, Setoto. I am Alka Zolka, Royal Marine and marauder. My friend, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span> and I have been searching for you."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"My lady, if I may be so bold as to say so, your radiance─it is blinding. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, isn't she beautiful?"},{"name":"CHOICE","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"CHOICE","text":"“She”?

Her glowing skin, her comely face─she is clearly a lovely young woman."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Very amusing, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I suggest you temper your jokes, however, lest the young lady before us take offense!"},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Now, Setoto, what prompted you to leave Bronze Lake so abruptly?"},{"name":"SETOTO","text":"As you are likely already aware, Surito Carito saved us. While on the outside we remain as tonberries, he has purged our hearts of the rancor. "},{"name":"SETOTO","text":"And that is why I left. There is something I must take care of now that my mind is once again my own."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"And what, pray tell, is that?"},{"name":"SETOTO","text":"Over fifteen hundred years ago, back when Nym was still at its peak, my father was a scholar and a Royal Marine. He was dispatched upon a secret and incredibly dangerous mission to infiltrate Amdapor."},{"name":"SETOTO","text":"The day he left was the last time I ever saw him. I suspect the reason he never returned was because he was discovered and apprehended by the Amdapori."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"...And so you came here─to the place the ancient nation once stood."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"You do realize that regardless of whether he survived or not, your father, he..."},{"name":"SETOTO","text":"I know. I am under no illusions that he might still be alive. Even if he somehow escaped Amdapor, unlike those of us sealed away in the tower, the passage of time would have eventually robbed him of his life."},{"name":"SETOTO","text":"I'm only looking to find something that reminds me of him─a keepsake, if you will."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"...It sounds as though you loved your father a great deal."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Very well, if this means that much to you, we─the Royal Marines─shall volunteer to aid you in your search!

Speaking of which..."},{"name":"ALKAZOLKA","text":"Setoto, you must promise me you will never again do anything so reckless as wandering a foreign land alone. The realm is a dangerous place─doubly so for someone with your affliction."},{"name":"SETOTO","text":"Very well.
