Should they be exhausted, the tribe will be forced to face the cold winds of the Abalathian nights without so much as a campfire to warm them. Wood is hard to come by in the Sea of Clouds, but the knights of Camp Cloudtop have been happy to trade in the past. Knowing that Vanu delicacies are prized by the troops manning the camp, Muna Vanu plans to prepare traditional Gundu catsfoot chew to trade for kindling. This required catsfoot herb can be found near Ok' Zundu, he tells you, northeast of his tribe's camp.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","You find three particularly striking specimens of catsfoot. Hurry them back to Muna Vanu while they are still fresh.","With the fragrant wildgrasses you gathered, Muna Vanu is able to add the finishing touches to his authentic Gundu cuisine. Now the task remains to take it to Caribault at Camp Cloudtop and trade it for firewood.","When you show Caribault the catsfoot chew, his eyes light up. His camp has more firewood than they can store, so he is more than happy to let you take all you can carry in exchange for the delicious Gundu treat. See it safely back to Muna Vanu.","Muna Vanu thanks you sincerely for obtaining firewood for his tribe. He explains that they have a long history of trading with so-called netherlings in the past, and Gundu snacks have always been a powerful bartering resource─he even considers repaying his tribe's growing debt to you in catsfoot chew..."],"objectives":["Gather catsfoot from around Ok' Zundu.","Deliver the catsfoot to Muna Vanu.","Deliver the catsfoot chew to Caribault at Camp Cloudtop.","Deliver the dry firewood to Muna Vanu."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MUNAVANU","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!
