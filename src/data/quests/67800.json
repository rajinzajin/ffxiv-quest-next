Thankfully, the bears are no match for you. Return to the Vath keeneye, and assure him that the road to Tailfeather is safe once more.","You return to Loth ast Vath to find the Vath keeneye with a look of relief about him. He confesses they received this request some time ago. Upon hearing there were bears, however, they decided it best to wait for a hunter─one such as yourself─to handle the job.
