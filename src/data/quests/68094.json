He beckons you to the Bangpots where he will discuss the finer details of the job with you.","Nonowato outlines the current situation: testing has begun on the Gobroller and it has become clear that its current pistons are not up to the job. The team at the Bangpots initially thought the ceruleum engine's power output was their sole problem, but upon increasing this, they realized the vehicle would not move without stronger pistons. Nonowato knows what material is needed for the new parts, but not where they are found. You agree to ask Adalberta on his behalf and set off for the Miners' Guild in Ul'dah.","After overcoming her initial shock that you are on the hunt for pummelite, Adalberta informs you that the mineral can be found in the peaks of Gyr Abania. However, this may be easier said than done as pummelite has become increasingly scarce over the years due both to war and the Garlean occupation. Undeterred, you prepare for the journey ahead.","Nonowato gladly accepts the five chunks of pummelite you procured for him and wastes no time getting to work creating the new pistons. He assures you it will not take long and that, once they are finished, they will be putting the Gobroller through another test by the Answering Quarter. You bide your time as you await the vehicle's final trial.","The moment everything has been building towards is finally at hand: the Gobroller's test run. Thankfully, everyone's hard work pays off and the vehicle operates as intended. However, just as everyone starts to rejoice, Stickqix appears out of the blue wondering what has his team so elated. He is slightly deflated to learn that these key developments all unfolded in his absence, but sadness soon gives way to joy as it dawns upon him that his dream has been realized at last.","Stickqix imparts an interesting morsel of knowledge upon you: he used to be a member of the Illuminati. Originally, he had been tasked with creating a vehicle that would allow Illuminati members to safely go on pilgrimages. However, things turned sour when Quickthinx stole the plans and warped the design into what ultimately became known as the Gobmachine. Your work finished, you prepare to go and talk to Nonowato one last time.","Nonowato tells you that work on the Gobroller is far from over. They have plenty of further tests planned and hope to refine the current model, eventually creating new versions of the vehicle. Lastly, he informs you that payment for your work shall be sent to the Miners' Guild shortly.","You return to the guild to collect Nonowato's payment from Adalberta. She goes on to inquire as to just what kind of place Idyllshire is; the job seems to have her keen to know more about the village where goblin and man coexist in harmony. You are bid farewell and told she will be in touch again whenever there is more work for you."],"objectives":["Speak with Nonowato.","Speak with Adalberta in Ul'dah.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Mine pummelite at the Slow Wash</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the chunks of pummelite to Nonowato</span></span>.","Speak with Nonowato in the Answering Quarter.","Speak with Stickqix.","Speak with Nonowato.","Report to Adalberta in Ul'dah."],"dialogue":[{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, a delight to see you as always.

Let the Gobroller serve as proof of our great efforts!"},{"name":"ZANSEI","text":"Here we are, the final stretch. Now that I think of it, the Gobroller will be the first project this team has seen to completion. We just need to make use of your mining skills one last time."},{"name":"FOHCWYDA","text":"We are so very close, my heart is all aflutter. Putting our heads together has gotten us this far and I hope you see fit to grant us your succor one final time!"},{"name":"STACKBLOX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh... Uplander will help one final time, yes?"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, allow me to begin by explaining how things currently stand."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"As you are doubtless aware, the Gobroller is close to completion thanks to our much-changed approach to the project. In fact, we have recently been able to run the vehicle through some basic tests."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"However, said tests did not provide the result we had hoped for. The ceruleum engine's power output was somewhat lower than expected and well...quite shamefully, the Gobroller was unable to clear the debris we prepared for testing purposes."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"We did all we could to fix this, even boosting the engine's power output. But alas, the pistons were unable to cope with the extra strain."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"In light of this, we have decided to create new pistons using a different, sturdier material. I imagine you have already guessed as much, but it is this material which we need you to procure for us."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Pummelite. A metal known for its high levels of durability, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity. The only issue is that I have no idea where it can be found..."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"What's more, it seems this mineral is rather difficult to get one's hands on. Perhaps you could try asking your friends at the Miners' Guild; they may have an idea as to where it can be mined. I would be grateful if you were able to bring back five chunks!"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Try asking your friends at the Miners' Guild if they know where pummelite is found. I promise you this will be the last time we require your help."},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"You're searching for <span class=\"emphasis\">what</span>? Can't say I ever expected to hear you of all people bring that mineral up."},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"You'll find what you need in the peaks of Gyr Abania. Word has it, it was traded fairly often back in the day."},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"However, that all changed over the past century. First, it became increasingly scarce thanks to the Autumn War between Ala Mhigo and Gridania. Then, once the Garlean Empire took Ala Mhigo for their own, trade of the mineral ceased completely."},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"But I imagine the Miners' Guild's very own <span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span> would be more than up to the task of locating a deposit of pummelite. Best of luck to you, friend!"},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"You'll find what you're after somewhere in the Peaks. Good luck, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Nice to see you returned, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Did you manage to find the pummelite?"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Precisely what I needed! I know I say this every time, but I am well and truly in your debt, dear friend. I shall set about making an ingot out of this at once!"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Finished at last... I could not have hoped for higher quality, even in my wildest of dreams. This will more than suffice for the pistons we require!"},{"name":"STACKBLOX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh... Where are the rocks?"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"I just finished smelting them to create a rather lovely ingot. But don't just take my word for it, have a look for yourselves!"},{"name":"FOHCWYDA","text":"By the Twelve, this is incredible! To think it was still possible to obtain pummelite... Exquisite work, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"KRYSTRYMM","text":"Listen, everyone. We must not let the fruits of <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s labors go to waste. We <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> create pistons capable of supporting our beloved Gobroller, do you hear me!?"},{"name":"ZANSEI","text":"I think everyone within a malm heard that! But I would be lying if I said it had not gotten me nice and fired up; it is time we got to work!"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"It shouldn't take us too long to get the new parts made and inserted into the vehicle."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"The plan is to test the Gobroller and its new pistons by the Answering Quarter. I do hope to see you there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>─you have contributed so much to the project after all!"},{"name":"KRYSTRYMM","text":"Heh heh, this is it. Everything we've been working towards. I haven't been this nervous since the first time I used an alembic to make a bottle of distilled water."},{"name":"ZANSEI","text":"Everything is going to be fine. Or maybe it is not. Wait, might it not be? No, I am sure there is nothing to worry about.<br>...Or is there?"},{"name":"FOHCWYDA","text":"We have done all we can. All that remains now is to see whether or not we were ever up to the task in the first place."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Good to see you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Everything is in place; all that's left is to put the Gobroller and its pistons through their paces!"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"We're just waiting for Stackblox to get the engine going and then we can start the test."},{"name":"STACKBLOX","text":"(-Stackblox-)Pshhh... Shkohhh... Commence whirlycog test!"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"(-Team Gobroller-)Huzzah!"},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh... Good day, everyone! Whatever is all the fuss about?"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Chief! Where in the seven hells have you been!? You've been gone so long we've already finished work on the Gobroller!"},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh... I see. Well, that is nice to hear... I wonder if this is how a mother chocobo feels when her chicks leave the nest..."},{"name":"KRYSTRYMM","text":"Chief, do not misunderstand us. We are delighted to have you back, but did you not think to even leave a letter before vanishing?"},{"name":"ZANSEI","text":"Quite right! I was terrified you had gone to that place where all good gobbies go..."},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"What are you talking about? I had simply gone to ask an old friend for some advice. I got caught up with some other business and told them to let you know I would be delayed in my return. Clearly this slipped their mind. Honestly, that blasted Brayflox is horrendously forgetful sometimes."},{"name":"FOHCWYDA","text":"Well, hearing that certainly makes me feel a little better. I was of the mind that you had abandoned the team for all of our constant bickering. It certainly gave every one of us cause for self-reflection while you were away."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"I wouldn't want to suggest that your absence helped us, but our revised approach to the project enabled us to boost the ceruleum engine's power output."},{"name":"KRYSTRYMM","text":"All the credit should really go to Fohcwyda. It was her redesigning of the Gobroller's innards that got us this far."},{"name":"FOHCWYDA","text":"That is absolute nonsense and you know it. Your advice on how we should fuel the vehicle was priceless."},{"name":"ZANSEI","text":"Seems to me you are conveniently forgetting all the work that I and a certain goblin girl put into the Gobroller's exhaust system."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"I would also draw your attention to my redesign of the Gobroller, which fully incorporated all of your improvements. Not to mention <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s invaluable help in procuring all those minerals!"},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh... Do you know what I saw when I first set foot in Idyllshire? Men and goblins working in harmony─a vision that gave me a dream for the future."},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"You have all turned that dream into a beautiful reality. And for that, you have my sincerest thanks."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Just the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> the chief wanted to see. I don't suppose you have already talked to him, have you?"},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh... <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, no doubt you have already been thanked enough for a lifetime, but allow me to express the sentiment once more. As young Nonowato stated, your help was instrumental to our success."},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"You may not be aware of this, but I used to be one of the Illuminati. They tasked me with developing a vehicle that would allow them to safely conduct pilgrimages across the land."},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"However, things turned sour when that dastardly Quickthinx stole my plans and twisted them into something different. Something evil. The resulting monstrosity was the Gobmachine: a savage weapon."},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"My frustration and sadness, coupled with the disdain I had long harbored for the Grand Master, pushed me to finally leave those mad goblins behind. I imagine you are more or less aware of the major events that followed."},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh... At any rate, your work for us is done. I do hope to see you again in Idyllshire one day, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">old girl</span><span class=\"alternative\">old boy</span></span>!"},{"name":"STICKQIX","text":"Pshhh... Shkohhh... There were a few obstacles along the way, but I am delighted that the first version of the Gobroller has been completed. You and the team did a fantastic job of proving that my faith in goblin and man was not misplaced."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"I am going to keep saying this until you are positively sick of it, but thank you again for all you have done."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Now that the Gobroller prototype is in working order, we shall continue our tests, eventually moving onto developing improved versions in the future!"},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"And someday, our work will give birth to a utopian Idyllshire─one where any disharmony between goblin and man is but a distant memory of the past."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Oh, and before I forget, again, I will arrange for your payment to be sent to the Miners' Guild! Please give Adalberta my regards when you next see her."},{"name":"NONOWATO","text":"Allow me to express my gratitude one final time, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I shall see to it that your payment is sent to the guild posthaste. Ask Adalberta about it the next time you see her!"},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"Welcome back, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! Nonowato had some very complimentary things to say about your work. Seems you've done the guild's reputation quite a service! Something tells me you'll find the payment they sent to your liking as well."},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"I know I don't usually ask about much outside of work, but would you mind telling me what kind of place Idyllshire is? It's been playing on my mind ever since the job came in."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"It's a place where man and goblin work together in harmony."},{"name":"A1","text":"It's a town that's only going to grow in importance as time goes on."},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"Men and goblins, working side by side, eh? Ul'dah could learn a thing or two from that, I'd say. It'd be nice to go and take in something so lovely with my own eyes someday."},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"Well then, perhaps it wouldn't hurt to do a bit more business with Idyllshire in the future. Maybe I could even look into creating a branch of the guild there. No need to rush into anything regardless; I'll give myself time for a good think."},{"name":"ADALBERTA","text":"But I digress. Good work as always, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. You can be sure I'll be in touch again whenever the guild gets a job worthy of your skills."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In breaking new ground as a miner, you have learned “Enhanced GP Regeneration”!"}],"reward":{"items":[{"id":5688},{"id":5693},{"id":5698}],"xp":0},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":70,"id":17}],"quests":[68093]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1019863","obj":{"i":1019863,"n":"Nonowato","l":2082,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1002298","obj":{"i":1002298,"n":"Adalberta","l":41,"q":16,"t":"Guildmaster"}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019864","obj":{"i":1019864,"n":"Stickqix","l":2082,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019865","obj":{"i":1019865,"n":"Stackblox","l":2082,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019867","obj":{"i":1019867,"n":"Nonowato","l":2082,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019872","obj":{"i":1019872,"n":"Nonowato","l":2001,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019873","obj":{"i":1019873,"n":"Krystrymm","l":2001,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019874","obj":{"i":1019874,"n":"Zansei","l":2001,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019875","obj":{"i":1019875,"n":"Fohcwyda","l":2001,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019876","obj":{"i":1019876,"n":"Stickqix","l":2001,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1019877","obj":{"i":1019877,"n":"Nonowato","l":2001,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020988","obj":{"i":1020988,"n":"Krystrymm","l":2082,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020989","obj":{"i":1020989,"n":"Zansei","l":2082,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020990","obj":{"i":1020990,"n":"Fohcwyda","l":2082,"q":5}},{"type":"item","id":"5688","obj":{"i":5688,"n":"Gatherer's Guerdon Materia V","l":160,"c":20255,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":10,"attr":"Gathering","category":2}}},{"type":"item","id":"5693","obj":{"i":5693,"n":"Gatherer's Guile Materia V","l":160,"c":20255,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":10,"attr":"Perception","category":2}}},{"type":"item","id":"5698","obj":{"i":5698,"n":"Gatherer's Grasp Materia V","l":160,"c":20255,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"GP","category":2}}},{"type":"item","id":"17944","obj":{"i":17944,"n":"Pummelite","l":290,"c":21209,"t":48}},{"type":"quest","id":"68093","obj":{"i":68093,"n":"Where the Money Takes You","g":144,"l":"Idyllshire","s":680,"f":1}}]}
