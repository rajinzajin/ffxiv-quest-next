However, he warns you that the Illuminati have been tirelessly ferrying supplies to their sunken home, likely for use in new weapons. Be ready for anything as you attempt to break through the Illuminati's last line of defense on your way to the second core.","Despite the best efforts of the Illuminati's foremost machinists, the path to the core of Midas is now free from obstruction. Press on to your destination.","You push through to the heart of Midas, and Mide quickly disables the core powering Alexander's left arm. Before you have time to savor your victory, however, Quickthinx Allthoughts appears on a hovering platform, flanked by a group of underlings. The Illuminati Grand Master duly indulges in his characteristic cryptic remarks, before declaring that he knows exactly who holds the true codex fragment. Though Wedge and Biggs make a valiant effort to divert the goblins' attention while you escape with Mide, their plan comes to naught when the moving platform on which you are standing stops without warning, catapulting the codex fragment out of the treasure hunter's grasp. With grim inevitability, it lands on Quickthinx's still-functioning platform, and he gleefully departs the scene.<br><br>You return to Bigwest Shortstop in low spirits, but take solace in the fact that two of Alexander's cores have now been disabled, ensuring that the primal will remain immobile. Backrix, however, seems nonplussed by your return. Speak with the confused goblin, and inquire as to the cause of his unease.","Backrix claims that not nearly enough time has elapsed for you to have completed your mission, given that you departed mere moments before returning. What could be the cause of this bizarre discrepancy? Could Backrix's heretofore steel-trap-like braincase be playing tricks on him...or is something more sinister afoot?"],"objectives":["Enter the Burden of the Son.","Report to Backrix."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BACKRIX","text":"Pssshkoh... Treasure hunter truly believes soul of lost love sleeps in metal giant... Madness. But Backrix does not doubt resolve to rescue Roundrox."},{"name":"BACKRIX","text":"Go with Mide deep into Midas, and deactivate second core. But do not underestimate Illuminati! Day and night, they bring supplies into steel fortress─Backrix suspects Illuminati are tinkermaking new weapons!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You now have access to the Burden of the Son. Midas can be accessed via the entrance at the Thaliak River."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"They tell me the Illuminati have been up all hours ferrying raw materials to Alexander. Seems the thrashing you gave old Quickthinx didn't do much to dampen their spirits."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"I reckon that means we're in for a battle and a half when we get to the core.

We'll soon see, I s'pose... Lead the way when you're ready. Me and Wedge will follow with Mide."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"I cannot bear to think what the Illuminati might be doing to Roundrox... But as long as Mide has the final codex fragment, she shouldn't be in any <span class=\"emphasis\">real</span> danger...should she?"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"I expect the Illuminati will have seen through Mide's ruse by now. But if they dare to try and take the real codex fragment, I will─ I will─ I will jolly well <span class=\"emphasis\">stop them</span>, one way or another!"},{"name":"MIDE","text":"Our path is clear.

And I s'pose losing this core was all part of your plan! Don't make me laugh! You know as much about the future as we do!"},{"name":"QUICKTHINXALLTHOUGHTS","text":"Quickthinx knows all.

All pieces fall into our hands."},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"Far as I can make out, the thing's in good working order. No damage, no signs of tampering... I can only think it was an energy fluctuation that did it. Just bad luck."},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Bad luck</span>!? You're saying it was pure chance that the platform stopped at that exact moment? Then what about Quickthinx? There is no <span class=\"emphasis\">way</span> he could have predicted something like that! The odds would be infinitesimal!"},{"name":"WEDGE","text":"Well...however he did it, the fact remains that he <span class=\"emphasis\">did</span>. B-But that doesn't mean we have to stand for it! When someone takes something from you, you just have to take it back!"},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"What a bunch of bleedin' dolts! Why didn't we just leave the fragment here with Backrix!?"},{"name":"BIGGS","text":"Still, we did do <span class=\"emphasis\">one</span> thing right, I s'pose.

And it just happened to be in <span class=\"emphasis\">exactly</span> the right place to catch the codex fragment. Do you know how difficult it would be to orchestrate something like that, much less <span class=\"emphasis\">predict it</span>!?"},{"name":"MIDE","text":"...Forgive me.
