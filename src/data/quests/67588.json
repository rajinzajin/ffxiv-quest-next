To her great dismay, it appears he has gotten into trouble with the Vault on account of his recent activities, which were mentioned in her articles. Determined to help Basyle, Mujih bids you seek him out at Camp Cloudtop while she explores all possible avenues of aid.","You arrive just in time to witness Basyle being questioned by two representatives from the Vault, Ser Vainctoroix and Father Aubierault. Ridiculous though it sounds, he is accused of besmirching Ishgardian honor by planting a foreign variety of gysahl greens on Ishgardian soil─an indiscretion which may well cost him his life. Unless you can provide conclusive proof of Basyle's innocence, he will be forced to defend it in a trial by combat. The desperate botanist begs you to go to the Botanists' Guild, whence the seeds for the offending vegetables hail, and ask Fufucha for advice.","Fufucha is shocked to learn of Basyle's situation. That shock soon gives way to pleasure, however, as she goes on to reveal that the gysahl greens in question are in fact of Coerthan stock, whereas most of the plants presently grown in Ishgard are of the Near Eastern variety. In order to prove this point, she gives you a bunch of Greatloam gysahl greens, and bids you gather three bunches of chysahl greens in the western highlands of Coerthas. Once you have obtained the latter, present both varieties of greens to the herbalist Martineau in Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral, that he might attest to their similarities.","You present the two varieties of greens to Martineau, and the herbalist wastes no time declaring that they belong to the same family of foliage plants. He commits his findings to a piece of parchment, which he bids you use as testimony. Hasten back to Camp Cloudtop and present to Basyle the items you have acquired which will prove his innocence.","You present the chysahl greens to Basyle. Despite being a botanist, he was not familiar with this variety, lending credence to Fufucha's claim that native gysahl greens are no longer cultivated in Ishgard. Offer him the other items to serve as evidence─the Greatloam gysahl greens and Martineau's findings.","Much to your relief, the evidence you have gathered suffices to exonerate Basyle of all wrongdoing. In an unexpected turn, Father Aubierault reveals to you that he had earlier received a package from the Botanists' Guild bearing a donation of seeds. Touched by this gesture, he promises that Basyle will no longer be hindered in his work. Speak with Basyle and share in his joy.","Basyle is tremendously grateful for your invaluable aid, and bids you share with Mujih the happy outcome. Find the reporter at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard.","Mujih lets it slip that it was she who sent the seeds, out of the desire to make amends for the trouble she had caused. She thanks you for helping her to write the most fulfilling story of her life, and bids you collect your reward from Fufucha.","At the Botanists' Guild, Fufucha happily informs you that Mujih's latest article has inspired many souls to aspire to botany. In parting, she marks your continued growth as a botanist with pride, and bids you continue employing your knowledge and skills in service to man and nature both.<br><br>※The next botanist quest will be available from Fufucha once you have met the following requirements:<br>※ FINAL FANTASY XIV: Stormblood must be registered to your service account.<br>※ You must have completed the main scenario quest “The Far Edge of Fate.”"],"objectives":["Speak with Basyle at Camp Cloudtop.","Speak with Fufucha at the Botanists' Guild.","<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Harvest chysahl greens in the Coerthas western highlands</span><span class=\"alternative\">Deliver the chysahl greens to Martineau in Saint Reymanaud's Cathedral</span></span>.","Deliver the chysahl greens to Basyle at Camp Cloudtop.","Deliver the Greatloam gysahl greens and Martineau's findings to Basyle.","Speak with Basyle.","Speak with Mujih Mewrilah at the aetheryte plaza in Ishgard.","Report to Fufucha at the Botanists' Guild."],"dialogue":[{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Hello there, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!

However, only one of them is worthy of the name─that which is native to Coerthas."},{"name":"AUBIERAULT","text":"The other originates from the Near East, and it is a pretender.

The first botanist of a few generations past brought the plants back to Gridania, and we have been cultivating them here since."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"And that is not all. Research has proven that much of the gysahl greens presently grown in Ishgard are in fact Near Eastern."},{"name":"FUFUCHA","text":"To wit, the plants under scrutiny are far closer to the “true” gysahl the Ishgardians so revere.

I'm not quite sure how they will prove my innocence."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Yet another kind of greens and a missive...?"},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"...This is truly the way of it!? By the Fury! I must show these findings to Father Aubierault at once!"},{"name":"AUBIERAULT","text":"All the gysahl greens found in Ishgard are the Near Eastern variety, you say?

Nay, my lords, it was very much at home."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Master Martineau further goes on to write thus: “Seeds are borne from one end of the realm to another by all creatures great and small. No matter how tightly sealed, gates will do naught to hinder their spread.”"},{"name":"VAINCTOROIX","text":"Are you ridiculing our nation's policy!?"},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"I wouldn't dream of it, Ser Vainctoroix. I only wished to draw your attention to a time in the past, before Ishgard closed her gates to the outside world."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Over a century ago, Near Eastern gysahl greens were brought over to Eorzea. Thanks to its hardiness, it thrived in our realm, becoming so ubiquitous that it displaced many indigenous species."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Species such as the Coerthan gysahl, which fairly disappeared. And indeed it would've, had the Botanists' Guild not continued cultivating it as a strain suited to cooler lands."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"These chysahl greens found a new home in faraway Gridania. And now they have found their way back home, to Ishgard."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"“Seeds know no borders; they will sprout wheresoever the earth embraces them.”<br>...In this manner, Master Martineau ends his missive."},{"name":"AUBIERAULT","text":"As the matter was still undecided, I thought it best to withhold this fact, but I had received a package from Mistress Fufucha of the Botanists' Guild."},{"name":"AUBIERAULT","text":"Contained within were seeds beyond counting, along with this message: “May they provide for your children and theirs after them for a thousand years to come.”"},{"name":"AUBIERAULT","text":"Never in all my years have I felt so humbled. Our own people would do well to learn from this magnanimous gesture."},{"name":"VAINCTOROIX","text":"F-Father! Surely you cannot mean to withdraw the accusations!?"},{"name":"AUBIERAULT","text":"The gysahl greens in question were of Coerthan stock all along. Our accusations were unfounded from the first. The matter is settled."},{"name":"AUBIERAULT","text":"Botanist Basyle. It seems we have been less tolerant than was warranted. Upon my word, none shall question your deeds or motives again.

Thank you a thousand times over."},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"You've done so much for us already, I couldn't ask any more of you. From here on, we'll endeavor to get by on our own. And who knows? If we work hard enough, one day we may even win over Ser Vainctoroix!"},{"name":"BASYLE","text":"Now, I suspect that Miss Mujih will be beside herself with worry. Please be sure to let her know that all is well. Once again, thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! For everything!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"...All of this happened? Would that I had been there to see it all! And “Seeds know no borders”─I reckon I have the title for the final installment! Make no mistake, this clash between religion and reason will make for truly compelling reading!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"Ah, but I jest! I've got more sense than to invite more controversy than I already have. The article will focus on Basyle's tireless efforts and the fruit borne of the cooperation between botanists. With that, everything will be wrapped up in a neat little package!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; Speaking of packages, would that it didn't cost an arm and a leg to send those seeds.

You mustn't tell anyone!"},{"name":"MUJIHMEWRILAH","text":"I wanted to make amends for all the trouble I'd caused, you see, and so I sent the seeds in Fufucha's name.
