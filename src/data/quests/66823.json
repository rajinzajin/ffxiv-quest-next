As Khloe Bajhiri of Gridania's <span class=\"emphasis\">The Raven</span> tells it, Commander Vorsaile Heuloix insists that it is simply a Garlean diversion, but the savvy reporter is convinced that forces far more sinister are afoot. To answer her earnest plea, seek out proof of the otherworldly nature of the disturbances, that you might secure a scoop worthy of <span class=\"emphasis\">The Raven</span>'s front page. Witnesses have sighted the supernatural storms in various locations: south of Fullflower Comb in the East Shroud, south of Camp Tranquil in the South Shroud, southeast of Horizon in western Thanalan, south of Forgotten Springs in southern Thanalan, northeast of the Foremast in middle La Noscea, and south of Costa del Sol in eastern La Noscea.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","After a hard-fought battle, you have emerged with a curious doll that would seem to be conclusive evidence that the Garlean Empire is not behind the disturbances plaguing the Twelveswood. Deliver it to Commander Vorsaile Heuloix at the Adders' Nest to prove his theory in error, then prepare to report your findings to Khloe Bajhiri.","The otherworldly force behind the disturbances was revealed to be one Shantotto, a formidable sorceress hailing from a distant world. As the mighty mage herself explains it, an oversized golem of her creation went berserk, raining destruction upon the land with no rhyme or reason─though given that the construct's original purpose was to conquer Eorzea in its mistress's name, this could be seen as a fortunate turn of events. Shantotto has returned to her realm, but her rampaging minion remains behind, leaving you and your fellow adventurers to see that it wreaks no further havoc upon the realm."],"objectives":["Participate in the FATE “Embiggened Spriggans” followed by the FATE “Tower of Power” to obtain proof of the otherworldly menace.","Deliver the doll to Vorsaile Heuloix at the Adders' Nest."],"dialogue":[{"name":"KHLOEBAJHIRI","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">Sir</span></span>! A moment of your time, if you please.

Searing flames raining down from the heavens, blizzards burying mighty oaks in snow and ice, cyclones so fierce as to whisk a pack of goobbues clear off their feet...<br>Why, those that have borne witness and returned to tell the tale talk as if another Calamity is upon us."},{"name":"KHLOEBAJHIRI","text":"Most ominously of all, one witness─a proper half-wit, but I've long since learned not to discount any of my sources─swears to have sighted a towering black demoness at the eye of the storm. He said the bellowing laugh of the “She-Devil”─that's what he called the thing─haunts his dreams ever since."},{"name":"KHLOEBAJHIRI","text":"Commander Heuloix, in all his stubbornness, insists that this is all merely a Garlean diversion, but I cannot agree. No, my nose for news tells me that something─or some<span class=\"emphasis\">one</span>─far more sinister is afoot. Something...not of this world."},{"name":"KHLOEBAJHIRI","text":"Why, I'm so certain of this that I've already begun thinking up suitable headlines. “Extradimensional Devastation Portends Eorzea's Ruination!”, “Preternatural Sorcery Wreaking Havoc─Will Our Realm Avert a Fate Most Tragic?”<br>I am not wont to employ rhyme in my articles, but the unprecedented nature of this story stirs in me a flair for the dramatic."},{"name":"KHLOEBAJHIRI","text":"I have compiled eyewitness reports from all across Eorzea─here, I shall jot them down in your journal so you might have an idea of where to begin your search. I implore you, adventurer: find some proof that the disasters are of otherworldly origin, present it to Commander Heuloix for a proper analysis, and return here with a scoop worthy to grace <span class=\"emphasis\">The Raven</span>'s front page."},{"name":"VORSAILE","text":"An otherworldly force of destruction? &lt;sigh&gt; I can tell you only what I have told the others. Without proof that this is more than just an imperial diversion, I will not risk the lives of my men chasing after shadows."},{"name":"VORSAILE","text":"What have we here? 'Twould appear to be some kind of doll. You retrieved this after felling a towering she-devil at the eye of that sorcerous storm?"},{"name":"VORSAILE","text":"I have not seen its like before, and yet I am quite confident in saying this is not of Garlean make. Perhaps I was too hasty to dismiss that reporter's presumptions..."},{"name":"SERPENTPERSONNEL","text":"Seven hells!?"},{"name":"KIPIHJAKKYA","text":"G-Gods preserve us!"},{"name":"SERPENTPERSONNEL","text":"We have an intruder, Commander!"},{"name":"SHANTOTTO","text":"(-???-)O～hohohohohoho!"},{"name":"SHANTOTTO","text":"(-???-)Caught unawares by my stunning arrival?
