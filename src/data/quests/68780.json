Thus he would have you travel to the village of Wright on Kholusia, a humble settlement that was once attacked by Dikaiosyne, that you might gather information to aid you in your hunt.","The bounty hunter seems to possess a connection to the village, though he refrains from elaborating for the present. For now, you are to split up and question the residents of Wright in an effort to learn more about your quarry.","Regrettably, the villagers with whom you speak are reluctant to discuss the fateful day which haunts them still. In light of this, it seems rather unlikely that Granson will have obtained any information of value...","Although Granson's inquiries were equally unproductive, he is at least finally willing to reveal his connection to the village─his village, it would seem. A year ago, he was still a humble game hunter living happily with his bride-to-be, a goldsmith who had been hard at work restoring an antique bracelet. Alas, when he returned from the shipyards with supplies for her work, he found the village in disarray, for Dikaiosyne had come and set about killing and corrupting all who crossed his path─including Milinda, Granson's beloved, who was transformed into a sin eater before his very eyes. Afterwards, Dikaiosyne wordlessly scooped up the antique bracelet and quit the village with his horde of eater followers, but not before the hunter was forced to put Milinda out of her misery. It was this tragedy which set Granson on the path he now walks, for only by taking his revenge on the eater which destroyed his life will his soul ever know peace.<br><br>※The next role quest will be available from Granson upon reaching level 74 in any tank class."],"objectives":["Rendezvous with Granson in Kholusia.","Question the residents of Wright.","Speak with Granson."],"dialogue":[{"name":"GRANSON","text":"All set to embark on our great hunt, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Then let us be about it!"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Before you ask, I've no intention of leading us out into the wilds without even an inkling of Dikaiosyne's whereabouts. Norvrandt may not be a particularly large realm─even before the Flood─but it'd take us a dozen lifetimes to scour every nook and cranny."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"So we'll start by asking around a place I know for a fact Dikaiosyne has attacked before. The village of Wright, on Kholusia."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"While I don't have reason to believe he will return, I'd like to think that the survivors might know something of value. After all, you can be sure that they haven't forgotten the day the bastard came through..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"So let us be off, then!"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Welcome to Wright. I reckon it might not seem like much to you, but to me..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Never mind. We'll save that conversation for after. Tracking down Dikaiosyne is what matters right now."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Let's split up and ask after the bastard.

That Dikaiosyne?"},{"name":"DISGUSTINGVILLAGER03244","text":"I...I can't help you. All I know is that when he came, he... Wicked white, if you had seen the carnage, you would... I'm sorry.

The one that came and killed everyone!? Oh gods, is he here!?"},{"name":"SCAREDVILLAGER03244","text":"Then why are you talking about him? Ohh, I knew I should've stayed inside. There's nothing but death out here now. Death and horror and eaters and... Gaaah! Gaaaaaah!"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Come and find me after you've finished your inquiries. It's not a big village, so you shouldn't have any trouble."},{"name":"DISGUSTINGVILLAGER03244","text":"I said I can't talk about this! What's wrong with you, thinking you can just waltz into people's lives and poke at their scars? It's not right!"},{"name":"SCAREDVILLAGER03244","text":"I thought I could do it. I thought it had been long enough, that I could go out and not see him lurking in every shadow, waiting to turn me like he did everyone else.

The Fangs of Orthus, he called it."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Me and her'd been talking about tying the proverbial knot─buying land, building a home, that sort of thing. Around here that might not take much, but it was still a lot more than we had, so when the trader made his offer, she didn't hesitate to say yes."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"I'd gone down to the shipyards to pick up extra tools and materials she needed for the work. Quality stuff, but it'd pay for itself ten times over. But when I got back to Wright..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Dikaiosyne had been busy. I spied at least a dozen newborn eaters fluttering about, trying to make sense of their new lot."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"The grandmother who lived next door and shared the fruits of her orchard with us. The gruff woodsman who'd brought firewood to our doorstep in the dead of winter. Both of them reduced to mindless fiends, just like that."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"There wasn't time to mourn or to think. I started looking for Milinda..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"And then there she was─alive and well. Our eyes met, and we knew it was going to be all right.

She just hovered there and stared, waiting for me to...to..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"...To end it."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Well. I could never say no to her. Not once in the years we'd been together."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"For all the times she'd welcomed me home with a bowl of hot stew... All the times she laughed at my crude jokes and gave me counsel when I was losing my way..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"For all that and more...I killed her."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"I swore then and there I'd have my vengeance.
