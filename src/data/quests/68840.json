If near enough is good enough for you, you may make the delivery in my stead."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"Very good. I shall ready the amaro for departure at once."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"Radisca's Round is to the north and west. You can take the road or you can fly─it is up to you."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"Upon arriving, make yourself known to the sentry, and she will give you further instructions."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"If you should become separated from the amaro, worry not─the beasts are trained to return to the rookery. That is all. Go well."},{"name":"SZEMDJENMAI","text":"The amaro returned without you. See that you deliver it safely, yes?"},{"name":"SOLDIEROFWATCHTOWER03304","text":"Gah, where's that last amaro?

You're delivering that amaro to us?"},{"name":"SOLDIEROFWATCHTOWER03304","text":"I'm afraid there's been a change of plans. We already have all the beasts we require here."},{"name":"SOLDIEROFWATCHTOWER03304","text":"Instead, this one is to go to the Imperative to the west.
