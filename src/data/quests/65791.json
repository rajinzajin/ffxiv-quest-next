Wishing to cheer him up, the guildmaster bids you make the poor soul one of his favorite dishes: grilled trout.","Instead of cheering him up, your expertly prepared grilled trout has the wholly unintended effect of humiliating Ingham, who interprets the gesture as a form of challenge. Happily, his urge to better your efforts prompts him to forget his woes, and he gifts you an amateur's culinary knife, that you might compete on an even footing. Now armed with a secondary tool, you continue along your chosen path.<br><br>※The next culinarian quest will be available from Lyngsath upon reaching level 10."],"objectives":["Deliver a grilled trout to Ingham."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"Ye've come at a good time, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>.

Determined lad, but don't take failure too well."},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"Anyroad, we can't 'ave 'im cryin' into 'is soup─plays 'avoc with the seasonin', see─so I wants ye to try an' cheer 'im up. An' there's naught like a good meal to take a man's mind off 'is many failin's."},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"A nice bit o' grilled trout should do the trick─'tis one of 'is favorites. Aye...if ye was to cook 'im up a plate o' that, I reckon 'e'd find the experience 'ighly motivatin'."},{"name":"LYNGSATH","text":"The main ingredient, princess trout, can be 'ad at the Hyaline.

A grilled trout...for <span class=\"emphasis\">me</span>? Well, yes, I <span class=\"emphasis\">am</span> quite fond of the dish, but what have I done to deserve it?"},{"name":"INGHAM","text":"The guildmaster thought it would cheer me up, you say? Hmph! Well meaning though he may be, food is <span class=\"emphasis\">not</span> the solution to every woe. But come, let us see your handiwork.
