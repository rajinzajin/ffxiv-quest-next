The scavengers had hoped to come away with priceless Voeburtite treasures, but the majority were slaughtered or driven mad by the fae folk. Those who survived managed to escape with two of three sacred treasures of the royal family: the Fangs and Eyes of Orthus. The third, the Claws of Orthus, is presumably still where the others were found, and Granson surmises that if Dikaiosyne is driven to seek it out as he did the other treasures, then it could conceivably be used to lure the Virtue out of hiding. Thus is it decided that a trip to the Kingdom of Rainbows is in order.","Granson is ill at ease in Il Mheg, as most outsiders are. However, as this is not your first time, you are able to direct him to Pla Enni, home to many Nu Mou, who were a part of Voeburtite society and may know the location of the relic you seek.","Though some have heard of the Claws of Orthus, none know where it may be found. However, you learn of a Nu Mou named Sul Oul, who once served the royal family and will surely be of greater help than others.","Granson, still ill at ease in the presence of the fae folk, is relieved to hear of your progress, and bids you lead the way to Sul Oul.","As you approach Sul Oul, the power of the Echo imparts to you a vision of the elder's past. You behold Branden, the fallen Warrior of Light, in a time before he joined with his fellow adventurers and was instead a knight sworn to serve the people of Voeburt. As a young recruit, he caught the eye of the princess Sauldia, who handpicked him to serve as her protector as she embarked on an investigation into a series of mysterious incidents in which innocent souls were irrevocably transformed into malformed beasts...<br><br>As you return to the present, the Nu Mou correctly deduces that you have the selfsame gift Branden had...prompting Granson to regard you with a sudden suspicion. However, once you explain your purpose in coming─the hunt for Dikaiosyne and the Claws of Orthus─you find yourself charged with yet another task to prove your martial prowess, this time by the retainer. They bid you journey to a nearby river where the Nu Mou used to bathe and dispatch a number of beasts. For Granson, however, they have a different request in mind...","As usual, the beasts you are asked to dispatch pose no challenge whatsoever, leaving you somewhat bemused and wondering what it was all for.","Sul Oul is satisfied by your performance, but a belligerent Granson has yet to indulge the Nu Mou's other request. Alas, until he does, your hunt must be put on hold...<br><br>※The next role quest will be available from Sul Oul upon reaching level 78 in any tank class."],"objectives":["Rendezvous with Granson in Il Mheg.","Question the residents of Pla Enni.","Speak with Granson.","Search for Sul Oul.","Stand watch for wild beasts.","Speak with Sul Oul."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"In order to undertake this quest, you must first complete the main scenario quest “A Fitting Payment.”"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Hey there, sinner."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"I broke the bad news to the widow of that scavenger while you were away."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"She took it about as well as you'd expect. After she'd cried herself hoarse, I started asking her about the choker and where her husband had got it."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Seems he and his mates took a trip to Il Mheg a year or so back..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Hoping to cart off all the Voeburtite treasures they could carry from an untouched ruin they'd learned about. Of course, in their greed they neglected to account for the fae folk, who killed or drove mad most of 'em."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Those who survived didn't come away empty-handed, though. In fact, they'd stumbled upon a remarkable find: three sacred treasures of the royal family."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"They escaped with two─the Fangs of Orthus being one of them─which was sold by another scavenger to a Eulmoran. Either that merchant you met at the Beehive or an agent of his, I'd wager."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"So the merchant gives it over to Milinda for restoration, after which Dikaiosyne attacks Wright, presumably 'cause he's after it as well..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Meanwhile, the scavenger here in Mord Souq keeps the choker─the Eyes of Orthus─locked away for safekeeping, and when he finally decides to sell it, the sinless bastard shows up again..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"...Which brings us to the here and now."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Damned if I know why, but at this point there's no denying that Dikaiosyne's been hunting the royal relics."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"And so, assuming he hasn't already claimed the third one─the Claws of Orthus─then I say we should get our hands on it first and then use it to lure him out of hiding."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"But to that end, we'll have to venture into the faerie kingdom ourselves. Those scavengers didn't receive the warmest welcome, and we're not like to be treated any better..."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"I've traveled to Il Mheg before."},{"name":"A1","text":"I was away with the fae for a time."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Have you now? And the little devils let you go? I can only assume they've taken a liking to you..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"...Why does that not surprise me. Well, if you and the fae have an understanding, perhaps we can traverse their lands without worry..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"That settles it, then. We'll head to Il Mheg and ask after this Voeburtite ring."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"What a remarkably uneventful trip. I kept jumping at shadows, waiting for eaters or foul demons or worse to attack...though that might be preferable to the fae, frankly."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Still, we're going to have to deal with them eventually if we're going to find this ring. After all, the Nu Mou were part of Voeburtite society, and without their help I'm not sure where to even begin our search. Perhaps there's a village of some sort you can guide us to?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"Well, there's Pla Enni."},{"name":"A2","text":"Not that I recall."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Pla Enni, eh? Very well. Lead on, sinner."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"What? I thought you'd spent time here. Think harder!"},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"Oh, hello there. You have questions for me?"},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"The Claws of Orthus... It is a ring, you say? The name I have heard before, but I know nothing save that..."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"Oh! Sul Oul served the royal family before the Flood. Somewhat temperamental they are, but surely they will have knowledge of this treasure you seek."},{"name":"DAENKENN","text":"Something about your demeanor bespeaks a question unasked. Have I the right of it?"},{"name":"DAENKENN","text":"A ring that belonged to the royal family of Voeburt... And it was called the Claws of Orthus... Hmm..."},{"name":"DAENKENN","text":"But Voeburt is long gone, as are the caretakers of the ring you seek. Who can say where it might have got to?"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Oh, I...I am working up the nerve to question our dog-faced friends. Odd little things, aren't they? Can't rightly gauge their ages either..."},{"name":"IALAOUL","text":"If I were you, I would speak with Sul Oul. They were a servant of...the princess, as I recall? If this ring was indeed a royal treasure, they would surely know of it."},{"name":"DAENKENN","text":"Weep not for Voeburt, for they had their time in the shade. All fades to white in the end, and we are no exception."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Had yourself a conversation or three? Learn anything interesting?"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"So this Sul Oul is the one we ought to speak with, eh? A former servant of the royal family...which would mean they've lived well over a century. Bugger me..."},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"I do not know you, yet you seem to know me..."},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"The fifth was discovered yesterday. A young girl not yet of age...transformed into a misshapen beast like the others before her..."},{"name":"BRANDEN","text":"As if we needed more proof of a pattern. At this rate, any citizen could be next. Tell me you at least learned something from this one."},{"name":"TADRIC","text":"I studied her remains myself. 'Twas plain a powerful magick had been employed─vestiges of the enchantment lingered long after. The culprit I think is not a man to be trifled with..."},{"name":"TADRIC","text":"That is all I can say for now, but you may rest assured that I will ascertain their identity ere long. On my honor as court mage, I swear it. Until I do, however, I would implore you and your fellow knights to dispatch any who turn or show signs─without hesitation."},{"name":"BRANDEN","text":"But these are our kith and kin! Should we not try to keep them alive until a way to reverse their transformation can be found?"},{"name":"TADRIC","text":"Your mercy would place countless others at risk. As a knight of Voeburt, did you not vow to serve <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> her people? “Justice for the weakest among us,” was it not? How many such innocents will die before you do what must needs be done?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"It pains me deeply, Branden...but the safety of the royal family is paramount. I fear that to take anything less than the most drastic measures would be to invite death into this castle..."},{"name":"SAULDIA","text":"(-???-)Death is already here! Surely you must see that!"},{"name":"SAULDIA","text":"I will not let it be whispered that Princess Sauldia turned a blind eye to her people's suffering. These crimes are a tragedy that weighs upon every Voeburtite's soul─mine most of all! And that is why I will take charge of the investigation myself!"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"My lady, be reasonable! You cannot put yourself in harm's way─you have a responsibility to your subjects!"},{"name":"SAULDIA","text":"So I am to gamble with their lives instead? Let them shield me while I alone take shelter and look down on them from on high!?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"Yes, exactly! You are their princess─"},{"name":"SAULDIA","text":"You are Branden, yes? The new recruit? A rather promising one, from what the captain has told me. You will attend me personally."},{"name":"BRANDEN","text":"My lady!?"},{"name":"SAULDIA","text":"You heard me. I will not stand idly by when I have the power to make a difference."},{"name":"SAULDIA","text":"Together we will see justice done for all─as your vow and your princess demand!"},{"name":"BRANDEN","text":"Lady Sauldia, I... I understand. Forgive me my hesitation. My life and my sword are yours to command."},{"name":"SAULDIA","text":"I have great expectations for you. I trust you will not disappoint me."},{"name":"SAULDIA","text":"Right! There is no telling when our culprit will strike again, so we must begin our investigation at once! There are witnesses to be questioned, clues to be gathered! Come, come!"},{"name":"BRANDEN","text":"N-Now!? Lady Sauldia! Lady Sauldia!"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"Ever the stubborn child. I wish you the best of luck, Branden. You will need it and more..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Hey! Hey! Are you all right?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"The way you were holding your head, as if wracked by a terrible pain... What happened to you just now?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"Lady Sauldia? You saw her with your mind's eye!? Then...then it is as I suspected! You have the gift too! You are like Branden!"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"...What do you mean <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span>'s like Branden?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"Why have you come to me? What is it that you seek?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"...I see. And for this “hunt” of yours you have come to Il Mheg in search of the Claws of Orthus. Hmm...I am afraid this is no simple matter. First, I would know that you are capable of facing the eater you seek."},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"There is a spot in a river not far from here in which I used to bathe, until a number of beasts grew equally fond of it. If you are the warrior you claim to be, they should pose no challenge whatsoever."},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"As for you...I have questions..."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"We've found our Nu Mou. Of late you've proven yourself to be a skilled conversationalist, so why don't you explain the situation?"},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"...See to the beasts, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Sul Oul and I have a few things to discuss."},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"You will have no difficulty finding my favorite bathing spot. Why, once you lay eyes upon it, I should be surprised if you too were not tempted to take a dip!"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"The beasts are no more, then?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"Good, good. I hadn't the heart to do it myself, for they were no ordinary beasts, but old friends who had survived the Flood. Victims of the curse you heard us speak of in your vision."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"So this curse transforms people into monsters? Like how sin eaters can spawn more of their own kind?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"I will speak no more of this or other matters until after you have completed the task I set before you."},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"This is not negotiable, Granson. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> accepted my terms, and so must you."},{"name":"GRANSON","text":"Hmph. So secretive...the both of you. Can't we all just speak plain?"},{"name":"SULOUL","text":"Your comrade refuses to acknowledge his situation. This may take time, but I am patient. Indeed, I have dealt with many a stubborn child in my life..."}],"reward":{"gil":1962},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":76,"id":156}],"quests":[68781]},"next":[68783]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1029959","obj":{"i":1029959,"n":"Granson","l":2955,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1029963","obj":{"i":1029963,"n":"Sul Oul","l":2956,"q":3}},{"type":"quest","id":"68781","obj":{"i":68781,"n":"Defined by Loss","g":179,"l":"Kholusia","s":121,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68783","obj":{"i":68783,"n":"The Hardened Heart","g":179,"l":"Il Mheg","s":141,"f":1}}]}
