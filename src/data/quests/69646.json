Believing that those who had previously sought refuge in Ul'dah are also in danger, Raubahn invites you and Arenvald to join him for a meeting with Nanamo, that you may ease the woes of these displaced peoples.","You arrive in the Hustings Strip before the appointed hour, only to discover that Nanamo has once again assumed the role of Lilira to walk freely about the city. Raubahn is confident in his ability to track her down, but you have the sneaking suspicion his claims are somewhat exaggerated...","You accompany Raubahn to spots frequented by Nanamo while she is traveling incognito. Unfortunately, there is no sign of her distinctive pink hair or matching garb.<br><br>※You must be following Raubahn to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated.","Raubahn begins the search for Nanamo in the most obvious location, only to have the wind knocked from his sails when he realizes she is nowhere to be seen.","Disheartened that his tracking abilities fail to live up to his own expectations, Raubahn asks that you take the lead. Since there is a strong possibility that Nanamo wanders incognito to learn more from Ul'dah's most impoverished civilians, you select the notorious Pearl Lane as your next destination.<br><br>※You must be accompanied by Raubahn to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated.","As luck would have it, you stumble upon Nanamo, who is quick to point out that there is still time before your meeting is due to begin. Refusing Raubahn's offer to let her ride on his shoulder, she makes her way to the Hustings Strip.","Raubahn and Arenvald share with Nanamo the latest tidings from Ala Mhigo and express their concern for the refugees who have migrated to Ul'dah over the years. The sultana reaffirms her commitment to treating all Ala Mhigans who reside in her city equally, regardless of their background. While this will go some way to easing their troubles, Arenvald suggests further measures, namely a memorial ceremony dedicated to all who died during the occupation and war for independence─including Ala Mhigans who sided with Garlemald. As the guests would presumably include staunch loyalists and relatives of collaborators, Raubahn expresses concerns that such an event may invite disaster. He does, however, concede that only by confronting these issues can they begin to move forward as one people, and he thus offers Arenvald his full support.","Leaving Arenvald to discuss various matters with Nanamo, you return to the Ala Mhigan quarter with Raubahn. He has high hopes for Arenvald and the proposed memorial ceremony, though the commander's own efforts will be dedicated solely to the immediate threat posed by the blasphemies.<br><br>※The next role quest will be available from the blasphemy hunter upon reaching level 88 in any healer class."],"objectives":["Speak with Raubahn in Ul'dah.","Speak with Raubahn at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange.","Speak with Raubahn and follow his lead.","Speak with Raubahn and have him accompany you.","Speak with Raubahn at the designated location.","Speak with Raubahn on the Hustings Strip.","Speak with Raubahn in the Ala Mhigan quarter."],"dialogue":[{"name":"LIVERATIONARMY","text":"Here to see Commander Aldynn, I take it? This way, please."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Our request for an audience with the sultana has been accepted. Before we depart, I'll share what we've learned since last we spoke."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"The blasphemy continues to elude us, all the while driving others to succumb to despair and turn. Even with Ala Mhigan and Ul'dahn forces searching for signs of the beast and more potential victims, we've yet to discern a pattern in the chaos."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Nevertheless, if our blasphemy is like others, its behavior is likely dictated by the passions and regrets of the man it once was. Therefore, any information concerning him and the life he led may help us to track it down before it strikes again."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"We don't want people to shun the families of the Skulls any more than they already are, but the fact remains that the vast majority of the beasts have been born from them. They're the ones at greatest risk of turning, without question."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Fordola concerns me, too. She came close to transforming once before, so I think it might be best if we keep her out of this after all..."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Seems like a waste of a capable soldier."},{"name":"A1","text":"She deserves a chance to make amends."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I'm inclined to agree with <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. She was able to resist the transformation and has shown no signs of succumbing since then. If she wants to do her part, I say we let her."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"If only I could go in her stead..."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Actually, I was hoping you'd come with us to meet the sultana."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I believe she would benefit greatly from your understanding of the struggles our people face. You'd gain from the experience, too. While she's not the sort to brandish a sword and charge into battle, you'll soon discover she's a champion of her own arena, as brave as any warrior."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I doubt she'd have much to learn from the likes of me, but it would be an honor to make her acquaintance."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Arenvald and I will go on ahead and wait for you in the Hustings Strip. We'll see you anon."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"It's the first time I've been back here since I, ah...discharged myself from the infirmary─without telling anybody, mind. I must remember to stop by and offer my thanks...and an apology."},{"name":"PAPASHAN","text":"I only let her out of my sight for a moment..."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Master Papashan was just telling us that Nanamo─or should I say Lady Lilira─has gone on another of her jaunts about the city."},{"name":"PAPASHAN","text":"Though it is not my place to question Her Grace's judgment, I <span class=\"emphasis\">do</span> wish she had consulted me before running off on her own. And perhaps I'm overthinking it, but it's unlike her to keep guests waiting..."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"If I may say so, sir, with blasphemies appearing throughout the land, it's a dangerous time to be going for a stroll."},{"name":"PAPASHAN","text":"I suspect that may be the very reason. She wishes to see for herself how the citizenry fare in these trying times."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Even so, it's downright reckless. We'll find her, though."},{"name":"PAPASHAN","text":"No, no, I couldn't possibly allow such esteemed guests to─"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Come now. We might be here on official business, but we're old friends. And as you may remember, I've a knack for tracking down errant sultanas."},{"name":"PAPASHAN","text":"Some might say that “knack” is a rather charitable─ Ahem! I should be glad of the assistance."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I'll take a look around here. Quizzing the locals will give me an opportunity to learn of recent goings-on in Ul'dah, too."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Well then, there's no time like the present. Fear not, with me on the case, this'll be over before you know it."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"If she's supposed to be meeting us here, maybe we should wait for her to come to us?"},{"name":"PAPASHAN","text":"Just between you and me, Raubahn has never had much luck at finding Lady Lilira. Rather the opposite. Which isn't to say that he's misrepresenting his capabilities─perhaps his recollection of events simply...differs somewhat from reality..."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"It's been some time since I last combed these streets for young Lilira. As a matter of fact, Papashan and I would compete to see which of us could find her first. As I recall, most of the contests ended in my favor."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"The trick, you see, is to look past the disguise and pay attention to the gestures and mannerisms─the tiniest movement that might give her away. Come, I'll show you how it's done."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"It seems I was so engrossed in our search that I left you behind. Let's try again, shall we?"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Follow Raubahn's lead and try not to fall behind."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Hmm... That's odd."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I've tried all her usual haunts, so unless she's hiding inside a barrel or something equally nonsensical, she must be elsewhere."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Gods...why did she choose now of all times to run off? What if she's been abducted, or run afoul of a beast?"},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"There's no need to assume the worst. We should keep looking."},{"name":"A2","text":"Perhaps we could try asking around?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"You're right, I know, but it's hard not to worry. Where could she be...?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Aye, I was about to suggest the same. We'll find her a lot quicker if we start by narrowing down who we're going to ask."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Come to think of it, something Papashan said caught my ear."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"He thought Nanamo went on this excursion <span class=\"emphasis\">because</span> of the emergence of the blasphemy and the beasts. To better understand how her people are coping with the situation..."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"If so, she'd be driven to seek out the most desperate and destitute. Pearl Lane, then."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Might I ask you to lead the way? I'll admit, my ability to track missing persons may have dulled somewhat."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Pearl Lane has ever been plagued by pickpockets and the like. I'll watch your back, so go ahead and give the search for Lilira your full attention."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Raubahn is now accompanying you. Keep him at your side in order to proceed with quest objectives."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You can leave Raubahn behind by entering a different area, or by speaking with him and selecting the option to part ways."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"If you wish to have Raubahn join you again, return and speak with him at the original location."},{"name":"Q3","text":"What will you do?"},{"name":"A3","text":"Speak with Raubahn."},{"name":"A3","text":"Part ways with Raubahn."},{"name":"A3","text":"Nothing."},{"name":"A3","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Ask about Pearl Lane.</span>"},{"name":"A3","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Ask about the poor.</span>"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Some say money can't buy you happiness, but they've never tried living without it. Those who call Pearl Lane home never had the luxury of choice."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"The city's poorest live here, and as such are at greater risk of turning. Knowing this, I expect Lilira came to learn from their plight."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"While it may not be immediately obvious, conditions here have improved considerably of late."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Her Grace continues to support the rebuilding efforts in Gyr Abania, which has led to the creation of jobs for many of the locals, both here and on the other side of Baelsar's Wall."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"In every society, there are the haves and the have-nots, and seldom is this divide more sorely felt than here in Ul'dah. Many of the young and able-bodied work for Lolorito as guards, though he earns more in an afternoon than most will in a lifetime."},{"name":"Q4","text":"Are you sure you wish to part ways with Raubahn?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"If you are needed elsewhere, I quite understand. I'll circle back to the Sapphire Avenue Exchange─there may be a few nooks and crannies I've overlooked."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Ready to continue the search? Then let's be about it."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Nana─ Ahem... Lady Lilira!"},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"Raubahn? Whatever are you doing here?"},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"And <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, too! While I am glad to see you both, our meeting is not yet due to commence for several bells. What is the meaning of this?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"We were worried, and with good reason! These are far too dangerous times to be roaming about alone, Your Grace."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"Hahaha! Some things never change... But I assure you, I am quite capable of looking after myself, in my own city of all places."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"More importantly, I wished to observe firsthand how the people have been faring of late, that I might be better prepared to participate in our discussion later. But I have finished, you will be comforted to hear."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Then pray allow us to escort you to more...amenable surroundings. Would you care to ride on my shoulder?"},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"Certainly not! You have already attracted more than enough attention."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I had every faith you and the commander would find her!"},{"name":"PAPASHAN","text":"I've a feeling the search would've taken rather longer if Raubahn had been left to his own devices..."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"I thank you all for making the journey here during these difficult times."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"And it is my pleasure to properly make your acquaintance. On behalf of the people of Eorzea, allow me to express my sincerest gratitude for your continued dedication to our cause."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"With respect, Your Grace, I'm just a soldier. <span class=\"emphasis\">Was</span> a soldier..."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"Still, I say. Commander Aldynn would not make such a distinction, and neither will I. You yet serve your people, and have provided solace to many of Ala Mhigo's most vulnerable."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"If we are to deal with this threat, we must forearm ourselves with knowledge. I understand you come bearing information regarding the blasphemy and its victims?"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"We have indeed..."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"Hence the need to locate families of Crania Lupi members who have fled to Thanalan..."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"There is no end to the struggles faced by Ala Mhigan refugees, and those who once pledged allegiance to the Empire are no exception. But rest assured that irrespective of their pasts, all will be treated with an even hand. All will be afforded such aid as I am able to provide."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Magnanimous as always, Your Grace."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"If I might be so bold, I've a question. What do you have in mind for those most at risk of undergoing the change?"},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"I believe there is but one recourse."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"Earnest and open dialogue."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"While some are born into unimaginable wealth, others suffer great hardship and oppression. The circumstances of our birth are beyond our control; our fates subject to the whims of the gods, some would argue."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"I once thought myself a prisoner to my fate. A figurehead, helpless to watch on as my people starved. A powerless puppet. I wanted nothing more than to cast it all aside─to free us all─but failed for my naivety. And then was afforded a second chance for my privilege."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"The world is unfair. Terribly so. But we have the power to push back against inequalities and injustices, if not overcome them on blessed occasions. To love our neighbor and share in life's bounties. To open our hearts and come together as one."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Truer words were never spoken."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"But without the support of the people, such words are naught but vain platitudes. Thankfully, my recent attempts to make inroads with the Monetarists have met with some success. Despite differing views on <span class=\"emphasis\">many</span> subjects, we yet strive to find common ground."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Common ground..."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"We've been pouring all of our efforts into aiding families of the Crania Lupi, and while it's seemed to help to a degree, some have still succumbed and turned."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Of course, they're not the only ones in danger. Ala Mhigans everywhere─whether they sided with the Empire, fought for the Resistance, or were caught in the middle─they all suffered. They all wake up in the night at times, haunted by memories of death and despair."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"We know what can happen if those feelings are left to fester..."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"The legacy of the imperial occupation will not soon be forgotten. But rather than seek to forget, mayhap it is necessary to remember. To acknowledge and accept the truth of it, that they may properly mourn those they have lost."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Aye... A remembrance..."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I propose we hold a memorial ceremony for those who died during the war. Everyone─no matter who they were or what they did. Let them be loved, let them be hated, but above all, let them be remembered...and in the remembering of the dead...in their honor and their sin...we the living of Ala Mhigo may yet find a sliver of common ground..."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"It's a...noble sentiment, but bringing together people who have reason to distrust one another and risk inflaming tensions could be a recipe for disaster."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Then again, we can't keep ignoring the marid in the room and do nothing to address the situation. As long as we leave it to the individuals to decide whether or not to attend the ceremony, I think it's worth a try."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Organizing an event of this scale will require a great deal of effort, so I offer my full support. Once you know what's needed, come to me, and we'll put the plan into action."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Obviously, some will balk at the idea─which is perfectly understandable─so I'll be listening to their opinions as well. After all, we want it to be a ceremony that brings Ala Mhigans together."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Erm... And I was wondering, Your Grace, if I might ask about your approach to...well, talking to people. Winning them over. As you can tell, I'm no politician, so I'd be grateful for any advice you can share with me."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"Why, I would be delighted to! As a matter of fact, I have a number of matters I wish to discuss with <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span>."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"And on that note, I suggest you and I return to Ala Mhigo."},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"Heh... Wonder what A'aba and Aulie would say if I could tell them I had a chat with the sultana? I can hardly believe it myself..."},{"name":"NANAMOULNAMO","text":"The relationship between Ul'dah and Ala Mhigo is one which I cherish deeply. It is imperative that we coordinate our efforts in facing this crisis."},{"name":"PAPASHAN","text":"To see the sultana grow to become such a capable and compassionate leader...it brings a tear to my eye."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"I knew Arenvald would make a good impression, but he's outdone himself."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Not only has he found a new avenue in life to explore, he's taken to it with considerable aplomb."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"And while his proposed memorial ceremony is bound to have its detractors, I have faith that many will come around. Not all, but...enough, I pray."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"For our part, we must stand at the ready for whatever may occur. I shall send word if there are any developments."},{"name":"LIVERATIONARMY","text":"Nothing of note has occurred in your absence, which I expect is welcome news in itself."}],"reward":{"gil":1000},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":87,"id":187}],"quests":[69645]},"next":[69647]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1039402","obj":{"i":1039402,"n":"Blasphemy Hunter","l":2408,"q":5}},{"type":"npc","id":"1039410","obj":{"i":1039410,"n":"Raubahn","l":2408,"q":5}},{"type":"quest","id":"69645","obj":{"i":69645,"n":"The Butcher's Blade","g":185,"l":"The Lochs","s":211,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"69647","obj":{"i":69647,"n":"Laying the Past to Rest","g":185,"l":"The Lochs","s":231,"f":1}}]}
