'Tis truly a blessing."},{"name":"CEHCEETH","text":"And since you are here, allow me to ask you a question. Have you perhaps come across an Ea at the very edge of the land, gazing vacantly into the great beyond? I would like them to join me for dinner, if I may trouble you to ask."},{"name":"CEHCEETH","text":"I believe my friend would appreciate the finer pleasures of eating as well. I merely hope that they have not already drifted too far..."},{"name":"DOZE04345","text":"...Hmm, yes? What do you want of me, stranger?"},{"name":"DOZE04345","text":"“Food”? What is this “food” you speak─oho! Yes...I do believe I am beginning to remember. Victuals. Sustenance."},{"name":"DOZE04345","text":"That said, your unusual appearance suggests to me that our concepts of what constitute a “meal” differ greatly. Pray tell, do you enjoy the act of eating?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"If it tastes good, of course!"},{"name":"A1","text":"Not if it tastes bad."},{"name":"DOZE04345","text":"Intriguing... What, precisely, constitutes something “tasting” “good”? I surmise this means that it evokes feelings of pleasure within you."},{"name":"DOZE04345","text":"Intriguing... What, precisely, constitutes something “tasting” “bad”? I surmise this means that it evokes feelings of unpleasantness or discomfort within you."},{"name":"DOZE04345","text":"I, too, wish I could experience this concept of “taste” for myself. Sadly, in my current state, such things are not possible. Ah...but perhaps you might briefly lend me your corporeal form for the experience? I promise that I will give it back once my curiosity is sated."},{"name":"DOZE04345","text":"...Well, you cannot blame me for asking. But it is no matter─I shall take it by force!"},{"name":"CEHCEETH","text":"You have returned! ...And yet, you wear a troubled expression. Did something amiss happen out there on your travels?"},{"name":"CEHCEETH","text":"...Oh, dear. To think their mind had already deteriorated to such an extent..."},{"name":"CEHCEETH","text":"I knew their mental decline had progressed, and I had been worried they would eventually go mad and drift away. I had hoped the memories of a good meal could bring them back to us, but..."},{"name":"CEHCEETH","text":"To attempt to rob someone of their physical form like that... It would seem they were already well beyond my reach."},{"name":"CEHCEETH","text":"I am quite sorry for having forced you into such an uncomfortable position─as well as the unceremonious way in which you were treated by one of our own. Here, pray accept this as a token of my most sincere apologies."}],"reward":{"gil":735},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":34}],"quests":[70000]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1038031","obj":{"i":1038031,"n":"Ceh-ceeth","l":3712,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"70000","obj":{"i":70000,"n":"Endwalker","g":11,"l":"Ultima Thule","s":618}}]}
