All the necessary elements are in place save two: astral and umbral nodules, the catalysts required to facilitate the process of channeling aether into the soulstone. Unsure of where to procure them, Ardashir suggests speaking with Rowena in Revenant's Toll. With any luck, she will know of a merchant who can provide what he needs.<br><br>※You may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","Hearing of your need for crystals with unusual properties, Rowena suggests speaking with a merchant by the name of Syndony. She is a jeweler who also happens to be quite knowledgeable about crystals. You can find her on the terrace of the second floor in the House of Splendors.","Upon speaking with Syndony, it soon becomes clear that your reputation has preceded you. When you inquire about the nodules, she is taken aback by your outlandish request, but is not deterred from the challenge of producing what you seek. The process will require elementally aspected luminous crystals, and she insists you bring her one of every element. However, she also believes there may be one other way: bringing her a Zodiac Weapon of the highest order. Seeing your nonplussed expression, she concedes that such a legendary weapon may be no more than a rumor.<br><br>※Should you be unwilling or unable to offer a suitable Zodiac Weapon, luminous crystals can be obtained by participating in FATEs in the following regions:<br>- Sea of Clouds: luminous wind crystals<br>- Azys Lla: luminous fire crystals<br>- Churning Mists: luminous lightning crystals<br>- Coerthas western highlands: luminous ice crystals<br>- Dravanian forelands: luminous earth crystals<br>- Dravanian hinterlands: luminous water crystals","With the nodules in hand, Ardashir is at last ready to go through with Gerolt's plan. He duly completes the infusion of aether, and hands the pulsating soulstone to Gerolt, who immediately sets about affixing the radiant gem to your weapon. Some time later, the sweating smith finally lowers his hammer, a look of both exhaustion and satisfaction on his face. The plan has succeeded and you are the proud owner of an anima weapon. Now begins the journey to discover its full potential."],"objectives":["Speak with Rowena at Revenant's Toll.","Speak with Syndony at Revenant's Toll.","Deliver the astral nodule and umbral nodule to Ardashir in Azys Lla."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Please note that upon completing the quest “Soul without Life,” you will receive an anima weapon for <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">an [Job]</span><span class=\"alternative\">a [Job]</span></span>."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you do?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Undertake this quest as another job."},{"name":"A2","text":"Undertake this quest as <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">an [Job]</span><span class=\"alternative\">a [Job]</span></span>."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Be advised that once you have undertaken this quest, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted it."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Please ensure you have changed to your desired job before speaking with Ardashir."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have already received [Error] and [Error]."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have already received [Error]."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To further enhance the strength of this anima weapon, speak with Ardashir again to undertake the quest “Toughening Up.”"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"To forge a different anima weapon, please change to your desired job and speak with Ardashir again."},{"name":"ARDASHIR","text":"I take it you're ready to proceed?

I shall see that one is fitted to your weapon."},{"name":"ARDASHIR","text":"The only needful things I do not currently possess are crystals capable of handling the quantities of aether required for our work."},{"name":"ARDASHIR","text":"To be specific, we will need astral and umbral nodules."},{"name":"ARDASHIR","text":"Would that we were working in Radz–at–Han. I knew of a merchant there who sold them. Costly though they were, I was never wanting for supplies. Perhaps Mistress Rowena would know of someone willing to trade.

It is my business to know all of Eorzea's treasures, be they material or mortal. But tell me, to what do I owe the pleasure?"},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"...Astral and umbral nodules? My, my... I see you are a <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> of unusual tastes. Might I ask what you plan to do with such curious crystals?"},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"An essence akin to the soul. I suppose such peculiar work would call for crystals as equally peculiar. Well, you were wise to seek me out. I've dedicated my life to the study of crystals, and I cannot bear the thought of knowing there are crystals I could not procure."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"Mind you, these are no mere baubles or trinkets you ask of me. Crystals of such purity are not easily come by, but to also be so rich in astral- and umbral–aspected energies..."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"Still, with the proper materials I believe it can be done. It will require a great deal of aether, obviously, and of a specific persuasion."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"I am informed that when a man falls in battle, a residual energy hangs in the aether long after his spirit has returned to the Lifestream. This energy can infuse crystals in the vicinity with a purity not often seen in nature. A purity essential for what you desire."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"I can use these crystals, luminous crystals I call them, to imbue empty ones with the astral and umbral energies necessary to create what you seek. But I will require one crystal of every element. "},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"They will not be easy to come by, of that I can assure you. You will likely have to scour every ilm of Eorzea to find them."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"...However, there may be one other way to acquire the aether we need. It requires something of the rarer sort─something much more precious than luminous crystals."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"As I mentioned before, it is my business to know all of Eorzea's treasures. And if the rumors are true, there exist certain weapons of legend said to have supped on the souls of countless enemies."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"In fact, a certain great hero who wields one of these weapons is supposedly working with a young researcher somewhere beyond the Sea of Clouds. Though this is only what I have heard. I will not hold you to ransom on the strength of mere hearsay."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"Even so, the rumors of these weapons are not so easily dismissed. Embodiments of war, veritable reservoirs of soul energy..."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"If you were in possession of such a weapon, creating these astral and umbral nodules would be as child's play."},{"name":"SYNDONY","text":"Or you could simply collect the requisite luminous crystals.
