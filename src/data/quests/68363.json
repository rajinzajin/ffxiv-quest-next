He asks that you accompany him to bear witness to his victory.","M'rahz Nunh agrees to duel. However, he insists on moving the battle to a ravine southeast of the Peering Stones. M'zhet consents and takes his leave of the camp. Follow him to the ravine and wait for the fight to begin.","It seems M'rahz Nunh has come not to fight, but to talk. As he tells it, M'zhet Tia's father left the village of his own volition, staying close by to keep watch over his former tribe. When a herd of ravenous monsters came stampeding toward the Peering Stones, he sacrificed himself to stop the herd, leaving his son in the Ananta's care. The weight of this revelation has left M'zhet Tia bereft of the resolve to fight. What will he do now?","Knowing of his father's selfless sacrifice has inspired M'zhet Tia. He soon makes for the Peering Stones to speak with M'rahz Nunh.","M'zhet Tia wishes to rejoin the M tribe to someday carry on in his father's footsteps.

My ribs have taken on an unusual shade of purple, but I bet that means the training's working."},{"name":"MZHETTIA","text":"I couldn't have come this far without you, though. It's only proper that I ask you come and see me finally take down M'rahz. What do you say?"},{"name":"MZHETTIA","text":"Thanks. You don't know how much this means to me."},{"name":"MZHETTIA","text":"Let's head to the Peering Stones, then. M'rahz won't know what hit him!"},{"name":"MRAHZNUN","text":"M'zhet. Have you come to challenge me once more for the title of nunh?"},{"name":"MZHETTIA","text":"I have. And this time I will defeat you!"},{"name":"MRAHZNUN","text":"Very well. Let us reconvene at the valley to the southeast."},{"name":"MZHETTIA","text":"Reconvene? Are you afraid I'll shame you here in front of your people?"},{"name":"MZHETTIA","text":"No matter. Well, it looks like we're heading to the valley."},{"name":"MZHETTIA","text":"There you are. I was beginning to think you wouldn't show.

Yet he would not escape unscathed, for one of the creatures struck him with poison that would soon turn him to stone."},{"name":"MRAHZNUN","text":"His limbs growing stiff, he used the last of his strength to collapse the cave entrance. The remaining crevice that would have allowed their escape was blocked by his cold, petrified flesh."},{"name":"MRAHZNUN","text":"That man was M'aht, your father."},{"name":"MRAHZNUN","text":"There are those who called him a coward for leaving, but in truth he was the bravest among us."},{"name":"MRAHZNUN","text":"Do you recall this blade?
