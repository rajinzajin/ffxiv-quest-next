At Ba Go's behest, seek them out and /soothe their anger, that they might return home and trouble innocent bystanders no more.","Their volatile hearts calmed, the pygmy bombs have returned to the loving care of their creator.

Return to Bo Zu and inform him that the deed is done.","Bo Zu is deeply appreciative of your efforts on behalf of his friend Ba Go, who he still considers a friend despite the latter's utter disregard for the hapless dustman.
