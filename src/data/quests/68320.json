While reluctant to do so, the culinarian is required to participate and hastens off to train. As soon as your friend leaves, Jelme turns to you with a request on the tip of his tongue.","As Esugen continuously places last in all strength-based tournaments, in the days leading up to the match he often becomes depressed. Jelme, wanting to help lift his spirits, has written a letter of encouragement. He feels too embarrassed to deliver it himself, however, and requests that you take it to the culinarian in his stead.","Esugen is visibly moved by the touching words penned upon the letter. He would like to thank the young boy in person for the kind gesture and begins making his way back to the Dawn Throne with you in tow.","Esugen's joy is short-lived for not soon after you return to where Jelme is, you are joined by his brother, Kuzuku. After directing a few scathing remarks at the culinarian, he warns the young boy against associating with Esugen then leaves. More than Kuzuku's harsh words, however, Jelme is upset by Esugen's passive attitude. Begging him to learn to stand up for himself, the orphan storms off, leaving you and the stunned culinarian in his wake.","Seeing how upset Jelme was by Kuzuku's comments and his passive reaction to them, Esugen vows to no longer let people to walk all over him. He has steeled his resolve and intends to do his very best in the upcoming tournament."],"objectives":["Speak with Jelme.","Deliver Jelme's letter to Esugen.","Report to Jelme.","Speak with Esugen."],"dialogue":[{"name":"ESUGEN","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, how kind of you to come by and check in on me.

There is to be a tournament among the brothers. Ever since we lost to the Mol, morale has been low and the elders thought this would be the perfect way to motivate everyone to train harder."},{"name":"ESUGEN","text":"A-A tournament among the brothers!? &lt;sigh&gt; No doubt I will finish last again and humiliate myself in front of everyone.

Do you think you could do me a small favor?"},{"name":"JELME","text":"These tournaments are used to determine an Oronir's skill in combat. Every time we have one, Mister Esugen always places last, and because of this, he is often miserable in the days leading up to the match."},{"name":"JELME","text":"I wrote him a letter to cheer him up. Without him, strays like me would starve. I wanted to return the kindness he has shown me throughout the years."},{"name":"JELME","text":"Do you think you could deliver it to him for me?

Your delicious food was one of the few things that helped me to overcome the pain of losing my parents."},{"name":"JELME","text":"(-Letter from Jelme-)While you may not be the strongest or the bravest, you are the kindest.
