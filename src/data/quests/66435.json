Corentiaux wishes to speak to you of this and more.","House Fortemps has placed a reward on the heads of snow wolves responsible for attacks on the supply train. Though not even yearlings, the beasts are vicious and have a taste for man-flesh. Slay four wolves and skin them as proof of your deed.","Where there were four wolves, there are now four pelts and a churn of red snow. You have scoured the blood from your hands, and are now ready to return to Corentiaux with the proof.","Many in the High Houses prefer to leave problems unsolved rather than ask for assistance from adventurers─especially when the problem is a lowly predator and the prey is a lowly servant or ten.
