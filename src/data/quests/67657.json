She instructs you to return to the Forgotten Knight, and demand that Ardolain allow you access to a higher tier of hunting.","Ardolain defers to Yloise's judgment, and allows you access to more advanced marks. He suggests that you peruse the Clan Hunt board to examine the targets Clan Centurio reserve for their more advanced hunters.","You examine the Clan Hunt board, and the level three bills posted thereon. For more information about the Clan Hunt, or to exchange Centurio Seals for exclusive items, speak with Ardolain in the Forgotten Knight.
