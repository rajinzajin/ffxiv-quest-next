Bo Gu, ever looking to accomplish the most with the least effort, proposes a sabotage operation that would see the furnace destroyed and the 88th take responsibility for the mess. Inquire as to the feasibility of this plan with the dig's explosives expert, the acolyte Ba Go.","Ba Go is more than happy to assist the sabotage effort, which will also serve as a test run for one of his most explosive─and most unstable─creations yet. Carry the augmented limpet bomb to its target before a change of heart results in you bearing the brunt of the blast.","The 88th's furnace is no more, ensuring that their alchemical accomplishments will no longer benefit the tyrannical Zo Ga─or anyone else, for that matter─and that they will bear the brunt of the fugleman's fury, to boot.","789th Order Craftsman Bo Gu gushes admiration for your efforts and Ba Go's alchemy, though expressing a degree of trepidation as to what might befall the 789th if he or his digmates were to incur the acolyte's ire. Your keen adventurer's senses tell you that such a day shall come soon enough, and that it will see your services needed once more..."],"objectives":["Speak with 789th Order Acolyte Ba Go.","Set an augmented limpet bomb at the 88th Order furnace.","Speak with 789th Order Craftsman Bo Gu."],"dialogue":[{"name":"BOGU","text":"The 88th is making trouble again─yes, yes, making cobalt for Zo Ga.
