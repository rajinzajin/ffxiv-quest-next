According to Kupka, tears were sparkling in her eyes as she fled the scene, and now, left only with a vague understanding of where she has gone, the postmoogle begs you and your friends' assistance in locating her. Astrid and Kupka Kupp are to search Greatloam Growery, while you and Pukty Piko are to head to Nophica's Altar.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You have found Aloyse, who expresses contrition for worrying Kupka Kupp. She departs with haste to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, telling you she will divulge all there.","Aloyse explains that Ezolmile, an Ishgardian blue blood, has sought her hand in marriage. Though she is delighted by the prospect of a life so happily situated with her beloved, she confesses to a worry she cannot shake: she is not noble herself. Heart heavy with doubt, she retrieved her letter, which contained her acceptance, before it could be sent off. Pukty Piko, now wiser to all things romantical in nature, insists she not give up so easily, and together with you and the other emissaries she writes her message anew. Kupka Kupp and Pukty Piko set off at once to see to the delivery, leaving Aloyse to wait for her darling's reply with bated breath.","Anxiety coursing through her─and unwilling to let her future be decided without her present─Aloyse races off toward the Gentry's Ward, where Ezolmile could be poring over the contents of her letter this very moment. Astrid, concerned for the young woman, urges you to follow her.","Upon arriving at the Gentry's Ward, you find that Ezolmile has not only received Aloyse's letter, but is in the middle of reading it as well. No sooner has he absorbed his beloved's words than he makes to write a reply. Aloyse returns to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre with all haste to ensure that she is present when Kupka Kupp and Pukty Piko rejoin the group with his correspondence. Lisette, left out of your adventure to the Gentry's Ward, must be getting impatient.","Pukty Piko and Kupka Kupp return shortly after you, and deliver Ezolmile's letter to Aloyse. Her beloved's reply is of the sweetest nature, and he writes to say that nothing can stand between them and marital bliss. To everyone's surprise, Ezolmile makes an appearance and the two lovebirds leave to discuss their future in a more private setting. So touched is Pukty Piko by the sight of the happy couple that her pom transforms into the shape of a heart, and she becomes a full-fledged emissary of ardor and affection. Kupka Kupp, pink with pride, asks for her continued cooperation during these most jovial festivities."],"objectives":["Find Aloyse.","Speak with Aloyse.","Speak with Aloyse again.","Speak with Aloyse yet again.","Speak with Lisette."],"dialogue":[{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"I do believe I'm beginning to understand this whole...ardor and affection business."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"There you are! And not a moment too soon. Your unwavering devotion to the ways of ardor and affection, love and romance, courtship and intimacy is both commendable and deeply appreciated."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"So, to the task of which I spoke. It involves a woman by the name of Aloyse, who only just posted a parcel with no small amount of urgency."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"However, she then returned, begging us to call off its delivery. A highly unusual request, and her eyes─twin pools of sorrow, kupo! She fled straightaway, ere I could even get my bearings, let alone ask what troubles her so. Will you help me seek her out?"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"You are too kind! Now, as for this young woman: she is an Elezen of great beauty, and thus should not be an easy one to overlook. Last I saw of her, she had just made a sharp left at the fork in the road, unless my eyes deceive me."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"To the left, you say? That way lies the Greatloam Growery, if I'm not mistaken. I will accompany you there, Kupka Kupp."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, Pukty Piko─you two will look near Nophica's Altar. Should you come upon her before we do, come find us at the Growery."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Farewell, adventurer! Do not tarry, for the poor heartsick girl is in need of succor only you and yours can provide!"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Oh bother, kupo! There is neither hide nor hair of Aloyse here."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Dear me, not a sign of anyone matching the description Kupka Kupp provided us."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"This woman here. Could this be Aloyse? I'm not much of an aesthete, but I know an Elezen when I see one!"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Who, me? ...Yes, I am Aloyse. Why do you ask?"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Kupka Kupp wants to see me, you say? But whatever for?"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"He's beside himself with worry, kupo! He told us you turned tail and darted off looking dreadfully stricken─downright morose! You can understand his concern, surely."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"I see... I owe him an apology for worrying him as I have─and an explanation for my frantic flight as well! Kupka's still at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre, correct? I'll go to him at once."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Actually, he─ Never mind, she's already gone. I suppose I shall go and fetch him then, shall I? Meet us at the amphitheatre, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, and do hurry─we wouldn't want her dashing off again."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Such a look of heartbreak as ne'er I've seen on a woman. There must be something we can do for her."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"How fortunate you were to have come across her with such ease! In retrospect, I realize my description was rather subjective."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Let us speak to Aloyse, find out what upsets her so."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"We had better at least get another epiphany about love for our troubles."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"First, let me start by saying how grateful I am that you would think to come and check on me. "},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"The truth of the matter is, I've received an offer of marriage. I meant to accept, which is why I came to you initially, Kupka, to see that my reply would be delivered safely."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"However, as I was writing to tell him “yes,” I found myself hesitating more than I ought to have been. I began to wonder if I was making a terrible decision, not only for me, but for him as well."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"The man who seeks my hand is of Ishgardian nobility and goes by the name Ezolmile. At the moment, he is...well, he is quite ill, and is seeking treatment here, in Gridania."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Do not misunderstand me─I was overjoyed to hear of his devotion! A life spent with him would be a wonderful thing. But I'm no noble. I'm of the most common stock, no more special than a weed underfoot. I wasn't raised with the aristocratic manners a future wife of his requires."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Who am I to marry into nobility? I must destroy my previous missive and pen a new letter, one telling him I can't go through with it...but that one I'll hand deliver. I won't have an emissary of love delivering such ill tidings."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Now, I don't pretend to be an expert in the ways of the heart... But isn't love the desire to be with someone, forever and on? The desire for a trusted partner in this world, someone with whom you can share your joys <span class=\"emphasis\">and</span> your woes?"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"If you care for him, be with him! Wouldn't it upset you to do anything but? It certainly seems to have. I may not have much experience with this, but I know that were I and my chocobo to be separated, I wouldn't like it─not one bit. I don't believe giving up is the solution, kupo!"},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Verily, I myself am of Ishgardian nobility and can thus speak from a place of authority. Each of our houses has its own traditions─it is our titles that connect us, not our principles. Before making your decision, seek the counsel of your beloved and learn what his family values."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"I could not agree more. After all, it is doubts you harbor, not a lack of affection. If you believe his heart to be yours entire, then trust that he will listen to your troubles─that you and he can solve them together! Why not send one more letter, explain what it is that vexes you?"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Yes, I see your point. It's unfair of me to hide my feelings like this. He's owed my honesty. But...how does one even write such a letter? I wouldn't know where to begin."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Perhaps you should explain your apprehension about fulfilling your duties as wife to a man of a great house. Make it clear that, should you decide to join his social milieu, you will require time to study, learn, and train before you are comfortable."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"A word of warning, though! To compromise the very woman you are in order to bend to the rigors of nobility may leave you jaded, haggard, and altogether infuriated. Thus, I suggest you first inquire as to whether his family is capable of accepting you as you are."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Why not simply write down all your worries? I don't fancy myself a poet of passions or what have you, but there's something to be said for getting everything out in the open."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"All of these ideas have a great deal of merit, and each should be given due consideration. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, what say you? Which of these notions has struck a chord with you?"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Ask for help adapting to his lifestyle."},{"name":"A2","text":"Make clear that you won't compromise who you are."},{"name":"A2","text":"Tell him exactly what concerns you."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Thank you for your insight, everyone. I believe I know what I must do now."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Then let us fetch you parchment, quill, and ink. Fortunate that you have us, you know, for we emissaries are never far from instruments of the post. Why, I shall even provide you with Valentione's Day-themed stationery."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"There, it's done. Now all that's left is for him to read it."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"My darling is likely in the Gentry's Ward. I know he enjoys sitting in solitude on a bench not far from the gates. He'll be there like as not."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Then that's where we shall try first. We will be back with his response as soon as we are able!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Tally ho, bird! Love's work awaits!"},{"name":"AIBOUCHOCOBO","text":"Kweh!"},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Will this be a day of rapturous reconciliations, or of doleful dissolutions? Either way, we are ardor and affection's most faithful agents, and have a duty to see this through to its conclusion."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"I am a touch anxious to see how all this unfolds. Keep your tissues close at hand. We may yet be consoling a very distraught woman..."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Oh dear... I'm so fidgety, I just can't sit still for nerves!"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"No, I can't take this any longer. I refuse to stand idly by while my future is decided without me!"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"That does it. I'm going to the Gentry's Ward this instant!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Aloyse, you can't─ Aaand she's gone."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Our duty as emissaries of love and affection demands we see that lovelorn lass through this trying time. I shall meet you at the gates of the Gentry's Ward!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"That man there must be Ezolmile, the well-to-do beau of whom Aloyse spoke. "},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you are good to come, but leave us postmoogles to our work!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Oh goodness, my tummy's wound itself into one huge knot, kupo! I must be more nervous than I thought."},{"name":"EZOLMILE","text":"Yes? Might I help you?"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"I'm sorry to have run off again like that, but I just couldn't wait around twiddling my thumbs another moment more!"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"We have for you a letter from one Ms. Aloyse herself, kupo!"},{"name":"EZOLMILE","text":"A missive? From my love? Thank you kindly, postmoogles."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Perhaps it's not my place, but if I may..."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Aloyse thinks a great deal of you. We watched her as she wrote that letter you now hold, and we could see plain as day how much she cares for you. If there's love to be found in this world, it's there, in every word she has put to that page."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"The heart and its intricacies aren't my forte, I admit, but if you've even half as much affection for her as she has for you, then what you two share is something wondrous. I only hope you can both weather whatever troubles come your way."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"“The heart isn't my forte,” indeed! For one who claims such a thing, you show remarkable perspicacity in the matter! You are quite changed from the moogle I once knew. Color me impressed, kupo!"},{"name":"EZOLMILE","text":"You are good to concern yourselves over my and Aloyse's affairs. Your kindness does you a good deal of credit."},{"name":"EZOLMILE","text":"I shall pen my response this instant. Can I trust that you will deliver it straight to her once I've finished?"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"We serve at your pleasure. Your trust is not misplaced in us, good sir!"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Did you hear that? He's going to reply! We should return to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre at once. I don't want to be here when he's sent our postmoogle friends all the way back there!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Yes, it would be rather awkward were his letter to have no recipient. Let us explain the situation to Lisette and wait for Pukty and Kupka's delivery."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Fret not! We can oversee the delivery of Ezolmile's missive ourselves. All you need do is wait patiently with the others."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"I'm curious to see his reply. Not that I'm the one receiving the letter, or reading it for that matter... Goodness, it's none of my business at all, is it!"},{"name":"EZOLMILE","text":"I ought to have parchment and quill around here somewhere."},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"Let us hope this all ends with tears of joy, rather than sorrow."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"I hope they return soon. Maybe I'm being silly, but I'm rather nervous to see what my darling has to say."},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"Our eminent emissary of adoration and affection is with us once more! And now that we are assembled, we've only to wait for the custodians of Ezolmile's reply."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"I feel sick to my stomach. What if I've angered him? What if he calls off the whole engagement?"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"We have returned! And with your beloved's painstakingly penned post in paw."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"I was wise to take your advice, Astrid."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"He thanks me for taking into consideration his position in life, but says that I needn't overly concern myself. His family is, as he puts it, “below the salt.” And though they're as well-heeled as any other house of their standing, they're not nearly so fusty."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"He says that there's no need to live a life I'm unaccustomed to, but that if I wish to learn more about his lineage and the social circle his family occupies, then he would do so with me. Isn't that thoughtful?"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"I took your words to heart, Lisette, and I'm glad that I did."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"He writes me to say that he adores me for the woman I am, and that he would never push me to be anything less. He tells me I have a quality that is all my own, one that no other could ever hold a candle to, which is why he fell head over heels for me in the first place!"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"His life here is a good one, one he's come to enjoy. So much so that he's even considering moving to Gridania permanently! I suppose there really isn't any need to worry about joining the upper crust, is there?"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Pukty Piko, I was drawn to your advice in particular."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"I wrote down all my worries, concerns, and questions in a clear and concise fashion, and he responded with...well, with some confusion, it seems. Although now, at least, he's aware of what troubles me, and for that he says he is grateful."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"He's very sweet here, you see. He tells me that together we will go down this list of mine and solve one problem at a time. Where we live and how will be up to us to decide─not his family."},{"name":"EZOLMILE","text":"I have come to ensure my letter has reached you, and see if you have yet read it. After all, you did the same for me. It would be unkind to not return the favor, no?"},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Oh gods...how embarrassing! You caught me spying on you, didn't you!"},{"name":"EZOLMILE","text":"You're embarrassed? For what, pray? I found it endearing, my darling. Ah, these companions of yours, did they assist you in your writing to me? Then we are in your debt."},{"name":"EZOLMILE","text":"Aloyse, my love. What say you to tea at the Carline Canopy? There, we can discuss our future─a conversation which is long overdue, I should think."},{"name":"ALOYSE","text":"Thank you, my friends. Where would I be without your help? And I promise, yours will be the first invitations we post once we've settled on a day."},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Goodness gracious me! Do mine eyes deceive me!? Pukty Piko! Y-Your pom!"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"Why, it's adopted the very shape of the season, and is lovely beyond compare, kupo! And 'tis much of a muchness with mine, or so I flatter myself to think. "},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"I can't rightly explain it, but seeing those two together brought a flutter to my chest, a spring to my wings, and the next thing I knew, my pom began to tingle in the most peculiar of ways!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"It's just such a marvelous thing to know that we had a hand in ushering Ezolmile and Aloyse's story into its next chapter. And to think, it was all performed strictly through the art of the post!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"Affectionate missives are more than just the silly folderol I assumed them to be. I see now that they show what's in our hearts like nothing else can. And we emissaries are their trusted custodians!"},{"name":"ASTRID","text":"That we are, Pukty. Only do remember that letters require more than just love─they are also in need of names and addresses. And speaking of names, perhaps you might bestow one upon a certain chocobo? Think of it as a show of not only kindness, but of love, too."},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"A show of love, you say? I suppose you're right. I was never able to recall the names given by my moogle acquaintances, but I bet I could arrive at something that actually sticks. I will give it some thought, make sure I've done this bird justice."},{"name":"AIBOUCHOCOBO","text":"Kweh! Kweh!♪"},{"name":"KUPUKAKOPP","text":"My once-foolish fledgling has wings of her own at last. How proud I am to see you soar! You are a credit to the emissaries of ardor and affection with your heart-shaped pom. It is my most sincere honor to have you among our ranks and I pray that you will continue this most revered work!"},{"name":"PUKTYPIKO","text":"I would love nothing more, kupo!"},{"name":"LISETTE","text":"What joy to be bless'd with so many couriers, and in this season of sublimity no less! 'Tis heartening indeed to watch our numbers grow and grow, for with so many, we can ensure that ardor and affection accompany all the fair creatures of this realm where'er their journeys take them!♪"}],"reward":{"items":[{"id":36013}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}],"quests":[70001]},"next":[70003]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1040553","obj":{"i":1040553,"n":"Kupka Kupp","l":53,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1040551","obj":{"i":1040551,"n":"Lisette De Valentione","l":53,"q":2}},{"type":"item","id":"36013","obj":{"i":36013,"n":"Postmoogle Barding","l":1,"c":58755,"t":63}},{"type":"quest","id":"70001","obj":{"i":70001,"n":"No Love Lost","g":196,"l":"Gridania","s":210}},{"type":"quest","id":"70003","obj":{"i":70003,"n":"Better Letters","g":196,"l":"Gridania","s":212,"r":1}}]}
