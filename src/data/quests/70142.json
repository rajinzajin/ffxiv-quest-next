{"quest":{"name":"Life, the Universe, and Coffee Beans","location":"Ultima Thule","id":70142,"patch":6.25,"sort":6,"icon":101192,"beast":16,"unlocksFunction":1,"eventIcon":71341,"issuer":1043951,"target":1043951,"genre":30,"journal":["You have the strangest feeling that you've forgotten something...or someone.<br>※The difficulty of this quest will be synced to your current level.","With an ever-growing customer base and a wide variety of menu items to enjoy, the Last Dregs is poised to continue its operations in Ultima Thule for the next myriad or so years. To celebrate the lack of emergency spills and other sorts of impending doom, Jammingway invites you for a tasty beverage at the café.<br><br>※Please note that the difficulty of this quest has been synced to your current level. Furthermore, you may not proceed with a class or job that is different from when you accepted this quest.","No sooner do you arrive at the Last Dregs, of course, than does Jammingway come up with a task for you to perform─namely, asking the customers for an honest opinion of their experience. Hopefully no one will request you take their order.","You speak with café patrons from various civilizations, who give universally positive reviews of the establishment. In large part due to your efforts, these once-despairing life-forms are now content in their post-replication existences.","You report the happy news to Jammingway and<br>N-7000, who are pleased to hear of their customers' satisfaction. Your conversation is soon interrupted by a transmission from Stigma-4, however─it would seem that, without apparent cause, Elysion has transformed once again.","Alongside your allied units, you arrive in Elysion to find it bursting with life─and also the Nibirun, for some reason. It transpires that they have explored all of Ultima Thule and understood its despair, but cannot comprehend the hope that permeates Elysion. After some discussion on the meaning of life, they are invited back to the café by a passing pair of Ea, where they may at last get a taste of happiness. At this end of the universe, after all, anything is possible."],"objectives":["Speak with Jammingway.","Speak with customers.","Speak with N-7000.","Speak with N-7000 in A-4 Research."],"dialogue":[{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; Precisely 86,400,000 timecodes have passed since our latest brewing incident. A new record! This unit's mission satisfaction could not be higher."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"I don't know about you, but I think we deserve a break! Care to join us for a tall glass of carrot juice? Carrot coffee is also an option, though I would hate to risk our safety record..."},{"name":"N7000","text":"This unit notes that carrots are still disproportionately represented on the menu, but accepts your invitation."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Now <span class=\"emphasis\">that's</span> impossible."},{"name":"Q5","text":"Travel to the Last Dregs?"},{"name":"N7000","text":"Such a pleasant atmosphere for processing... This unit now understands organic life-forms' obsession with beverage consumption."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"The Last Dregs certainly has come a long way. Remember when the counter was dusty and musty?"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"I still don't know what civilization originally built these structures, but I like to think they'd be happy to see what we've done with the place. Perhaps they ran a café of their own, long ago..."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"...Actually, while you're here, can I trouble you to check in with the patrons?"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"As you well know, customer satisfaction is our first priority─and they wouldn't dare fob <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> off with a platitude."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"What are they saying? Do they like it!?"},{"name":"N7000","text":"...This unit apologizes for once again burdening you with an extra shift."},{"name":"KARELEANA","text":"It has been quite some time since I began cooperating with this lout, hasn't it? Though I can scarce believe it myself, we are as allies now. Some even call us “friends”─to which I take offense, of course. Perish the thought."},{"name":"KARELEANB","text":"Pfft... As if you don't wander over to my side of the garden half a dozen times per shift to raise your “suggestions.” Perhaps people would possess a more accurate conception of our relationship if you did not so clearly crave my insight."},{"name":"KARELEANB","text":"Still, I've come to believe that anyone who enjoys the Last Dregs as much as I do cannot be all bad. Even if he has poor taste in helmets."},{"name":"KARELEANA","text":"\"Poor taste in helmets“... I have never been so offended in all my life. I will require quite some time to fully detail the inaccuracy of that statement─another round, please."},{"name":"KARELEANB","text":"We came here to research what other vegetables may be of value to the menu, not to discuss personal issues, but you know how he is..."},{"name":"GREBULOFFA","text":"This place? I love it here! It reminds me of home almost as much as the sea on Elysion."},{"name":"GREBULOFFB","text":"And such a pristine sea it is. Each time I devour a delicious fish, I reaffirm my vow to protect it! ...One serving of the fish, please."},{"name":"GREBULOFFA","text":"By the by, are there any imminent plans for salty sea breeze coffee? It would pair well with the soup..."},{"name":"GREBULOFFB","text":"While the sea's vistas are by far the most charming, the other scenery of Elysion has proven quite enjoyable as well! The peaks, the trees, whatever that weird place with the monoliths is..."},{"name":"EAOMIA","text":"Yes, the transmission of other beings' gustatory perception has been most effective. I believe I should like to experience haptic transmissions next─these “burns to the tongue” reported by the beings that consume coffee rapidly sound intriguing..."},{"name":"EAOMIA","text":"Why do you hasten so? There are yet many gustatory sensations we must experience. The Karellians' and Grebuloffs' perceptions were illuminating."},{"name":"EAOMIB","text":"The atmosphere, too, is quite enjoyable. Though the other beings are, naturally, unequipped to discuss the finer mysteries of the universe, the idle chatter pleases me. In fact, I've scarcely rebuked anyone at all."},{"name":"EAOMIA","text":"Of late, we have been delving into the mystery of what gustatory triggers the Miw Miisv enjoy. Helpfully, their displeasure upon experiencing a sensation that they do not prefer is obvious."},{"name":"EAOMIB","text":"For our next subject of conversation, I propose a relaxing round of “Should the milk go in first or last?”"},{"name":"DRAGONOMI","text":"Thy consideration is appreciated, hero. For me, 'tis enough to gaze upon the tiny dessert and feel the wind on my scales."},{"name":"DRAGONOMI","text":"Indeed, the true winds of Elysion are divine... Yet I find myself drawn to the pastry nonetheless. The sentiment by which thou didst create it warmeth my heart even now."},{"name":"DRAGONOMI","text":"It hath been many years since last I found myself so rested. Perhaps a song to mark the occasion..."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"...Well? Are they happy!?"},{"name":"N7000","text":"Allow this unit to thank you in the perpetually anxious life-form's stead. Your data collection is appreciated."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"I am not perpetually anxious! This is a normal amount of concern!"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"But yes─thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. How did you find our customers?"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Thank goodness they're still enjoying themselves. I would hate to play host to any more firefights. Or fistfights. Or food fights..."},{"name":"N7000","text":"Data from barista unit M-104 indicates that patron numbers are only increasing. Business future secure."},{"name":"N7000","text":"Though this unit personally wishes us to seek out even more civilizations' data nevertheless. Much of the universe remains to be restored to life and hope."},{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; Incoming transmission from Stigma-4..."},{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; New life!? Allied units, there is new life on Elysion! Scans indicate more than one additional life-form."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Oh, don't bore us with the logs─if it's worth scanning, it's worth seeing!"},{"name":"Q6","text":"Travel to A-4 Research?"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Unsurprisingly, I was treated to more logs anyway. The good news is that every single part of Elysion has grown!"},{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; This unit will not spoil any further revelations─let us proceed."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Sweet Mother! Stigma-4 wasn't kidding. Not that it can..."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Look over there!"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Ack! What are you doing here?"},{"name":"NIBIRAENOMI","text":"As your companion suggested, we have traversed the dead worlds of Ultima Thule. We have seen its despair."},{"name":"NIBIRAENOMI","text":"We have seen the tragedy of the forgotten, and the sorrow of those who forget themselves. This is well..."},{"name":"NIBIRAENOMI","text":"Yet this star is different. There is life here. There is change..."},{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; This unit understands that this is difficult for you to accept. The mission to live is no simple matter..."},{"name":"NIBIRAENOMI","text":"Then why do you grasp for life in a universe that will one day die? Why seek to change that which cannot be changed?"},{"name":"N7000","text":"This unit hopes you will not take this as a personal attack, but it would assert that a broad perspective is required."},{"name":"N7000","text":"It is true that each civilization is vulnerable. A single particle of despair, placed in the right code─the right body, the right mind─can spread like a virus."},{"name":"N7000","text":"Yet there is more than one civilization in this universe. The disease that kills one spares another. The sorrow that consumes one drives others to seek joy."},{"name":"N7000","text":"Together, we survive. Together, we see beyond our limitations. And together, we find reason to hope."},{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; So long as we live, and so long as we have even one reason to hope, the dynamis will change for us. Beyond our despair lies an infinitude of miracles─we need only open our receptors to them."},{"name":"NIBIRAENOMI","text":"We obtained physical life eternal and complete mental resonance to determine that existence is meaningless. Despite all of that, you say we were...wrong?"},{"name":"EAOMIB","text":"Please refrain from leaping to conclusions. Whether the inherent meaning of life─or lack thereof─can be proven by the existence of miracles remains up for debate."},{"name":"EAOMIB","text":"We Ea have grappled with such questions since time immemorial. You are welcome to join us for further discussion and gustatory stimulation at the café before deciding that your civilization was replete with buffoons."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"So long as you keep the doom and gloom confined to your conversation with mentally unflappable beings, that should be fine. And who knows─a nice cup of coffee might cheer you up a bit."},{"name":"N7000","text":"This unit can vouch for the utility of our beverages in processing philosophical conundrums."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"That too! Perhaps they'll even find something new to ponder. It's the little things, as they say..."},{"name":"N7000","text":"There will be time enough for all civilizations to find hope for the future, given the proposed eternal opening schedule. This unit has set reminders to look out for the end of the universe, in case additional menu items are required."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"That's what I like to hear! Less fatalism, more carrots of happiness!"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"We'll have to explore the new Elysion when we have a bit more time."},{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; These developments are pleasing, but...whence did they originate?"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Changes occurred soon after <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> asked our customers to reflect on their experience at the café, no?"},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Perhaps realizing how happy they are increased their faith in a brighter future."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"And perhaps even the Nibirun were moved by the sight of a world that had not fallen to despair..."},{"name":"N7000","text":"In any case, the value of our mission is clear."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"You bet it is! ...Ahhh, it's so nice to not have to do all of the emotional lifting around here anymore."},{"name":"JAMMINGWAY","text":"Do come back and join us from time to time, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. We'll be here─forever!"},{"name":"N7000","text":"Affirmative. Your labor has been greatly valued. We would be delighted to assign you shifts at any time..."},{"name":"N7000","text":"&lt;whirr&gt; This unit jests! Your friendship is also valued. Should you ever need a place to process, you are always welcome for a beverage of indeterminate nature at the Last Dregs."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You have achieved <span class=\"highlight\">Bloodsworn</span> reputation with the staff and patrons of the Last Dregs."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You will receive an experience point bonus upon the completion of Last Dregs tribal daily quests."}],"reward":{"gil":975},"reqs":{"beastrank":7,"jobs":[{"lvl":80,"id":32}],"quests":[70141]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1043951","obj":{"i":1043951,"n":"N-7000","l":3712,"q":5}},{"type":"quest","id":"70141","obj":{"i":70141,"n":"Mostly Heartless","g":30,"l":"Ultima Thule","s":5,"f":1}}]}
