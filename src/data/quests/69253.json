{"quest":{"name":"A Scandal in Komra","location":"Kholusia","id":69253,"patch":5.1,"sort":10,"icon":100944,"unlocksFunction":1,"eventIcon":71341,"issuer":1031577,"target":1031586,"genre":24,"journal":["A certain gossipy dwarf has news that might be of interest to you.","According to the gossipy dwarf, Komra has recently been troubled by a number of thefts. The culprit has yet to be identified, and there are fears that the lingering enmity between the dwarven communities could lead the residents of Komra to hold Tomra's people responsible, so <span class=\"emphasis\">someone</span> must solve the mystery before tensions rise. Why this someone should be you is unclear, but is that not always the way of it?","You speak with the chief of the dig site in Komra, who confirms that both priceless artifacts and excavation tools have gone missing. Alas, he is at a loss for leads, so he suggests that you continue the investigation in his stead. Perhaps there will be some manner of clue that can only be spotted through eyes honed by many years of seeking out random objects at the behest of everyone and their mothers.","Though you are not so fortunate as to catch the culprit in the act, searching the area the chief indicated does reveal one thing that is not like the others─a bejeweled bracelet. Its make and general state of cleanliness suggest that it was not so recently recovered from ruins as its location might lead one to think, but the dig site chief ought to be able to tell you for certain.","The chief confirms that the bracelet you picked up does not, in fact, belong at the dig site. He believes that he has previously seen it on a young woman in the village─who is likely visibly distressed by its loss at the moment, and therefore should be easy enough to seek out.","You speak to the bracelet's owner, who is both relieved to have her accessory returned and more than willing to provide information on its origin. Apparently, it was given to her by the dig site watch, which paints at least a partial picture of how it ended up where it did─or at least enough of one to know that probing further into the particulars would be unwise, lest you be forced to imagine salacious sights that the mind's eye cannot unsee. Unfortunately, she does not know whence the site watch himself purchased the item, or indeed how he managed to afford it to begin with.","After witnessing yet another argument between the dwarven siblings Anogg and Konogg and the dig site watch over whether the twins might be allowed into the machine graveyard, you inquire as to how he got his hands on the bracelet. Suspiciously, he seems loath to divulge the details─details that an innocent man would surely have no reason not to relate.","The watchman's figurative evasiveness turns literal as he flees the scene. He is pursued by the ever-persistent Anogg and Konogg─who have nothing at all to do with the matter at hand, but are happy to seize any opportunity that might allow them to relieve the man of the key to the ruins.","You follow on the heels of the dwarven siblings, who at last corner the watchman─only to find that the watch<span class=\"emphasis\">man</span> has in fact been a set of three identical watch<span class=\"emphasis\">men</span> all this time. This raises several questions, but two of the triplets take up arms before you can ask even one, and if they so desire to do battle, who are you not to oblige?","You defeat two of the brothers that had been masquerading as one man with little effort. They flee once again but, given the beating that you doled out not moments ago, are unlikely to get far enough to cause further trouble. All that remains is to track down the third and ensure that he understands what will happen if he continues to be a belligerent imbecile.","You find the final triplet, and once again press him to confess his crimes. He gives in immediately, divulging the brothers' plan to sell off valuables from the dig site in order to obtain funds for gifts that might be used to woo the lass from the village whom you met earlier. Left with little recourse but to repent lest he suffer the same pummeling as his siblings, he departs to beg the dig site chief's mercy.","You spy a gleaming object on the ground─the dig site key, presumably dropped by the watchman in his haste to escape punishment at your hands. What you do with the key is up to you, but it would be prudent to at least check in with the chief and see if he's noticed that it's missing before absconding with it.","The chief has not, in fact, noticed that the watch's key has vanished into the aether. He seems quite relieved that the caper has been resolved, so perhaps the lump of iron in your pocket can be considered fair payment for your services."],"objectives":["Speak with the dig site chief in Komra.","Search for clues.","Show the bejeweled bracelet to the dig site chief.","Deliver the bejeweled bracelet to the delicate dwarven damsel.","Speak with the dig site watch.","Demonstrate that you /doubt the dig site watch.","Speak with Anogg.","Defeat the identical beardrippers.","Search for the dig site watch.","Investigate the metallic glint.","Report to the dig site chief."],"dialogue":[{"name":"RUMORSDWARF03671","text":"Hail, sinner! Have you heard about the string of thefts in Komra? Word has it that they haven't the foggiest who's behind them. Not a clue! They've gotten desperate to find the culprit, I'm told, pointing fingers at any who so much as sneeze in a suspicious fashion."},{"name":"RUMORSDWARF03671","text":"Why, the next thing you know, they'll be blaming their old rivals in Tomr─ Wicked white! They <span class=\"emphasis\">would</span> do that, wouldn't they? Damn those thin-bearded blighters! Listen, sinner, you go and tell them that if they try to pin this on us, there'll be consequences..."},{"name":"RUMORSDWARF03671","text":"Those bastards! How dare they theoretically accuse us of petty theft!"},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"Yes, yes, lali-bleeding-h─ Oh, it's you. My apologies, sinner. Been under a bit of stress lately and don't really have time to chat. Although..."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"Perhaps you can help. I know you welcome these sorts of requests for aid, after all."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"Things've been going missing, you see─at first it was just the odd tool here and there, but then the thief began making off with finds from the dig. <span class=\"emphasis\">Valuable</span> finds. If you've got the time, I could use some help in identifying the culprit."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"I don't like to think of it, but it's likely that the thief is one of our own. Hard to access the site otherwise, and I've stalk─er, <span class=\"emphasis\">investigated</span> most of the unfamiliar faces in town to no avail."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"I can't very well ask you to stroll up to folks with a, “Lali-ho! Done any crimes lately?” But do have a look around─perhaps you can find a clue that I've overlooked. I'll take anything at this point, frankly."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"If you're wondering why I don't simply lie in wait by the valuables, well...let's just say that if there's one thing I've learned these past few days, it's that I'm not the subtlest tack."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"I don't intend to let this miscreant run amok, though. I'll be here waiting when you have something to report."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"Hmm... You don't look to have our criminal stuffed in your pack there, but I take it you've found some manner of clue?"},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"Hold on, I think I've seen this before! It belongs to a young lady in the village, if I'm not mistaken─though I couldn't say how she came by such a valuable trinket."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"Seeing as regular folk can hardly fail to notice when something jewel-encrusted goes missing, she'll like as not be wondering where it's gone right about now. You'll probably find her in a panic─all the better for getting her to spill her secrets."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"Have a look around the village for any lass who seems out-of-sorts. That's who you'll want to interrogate, mark my words."},{"name":"YOUNGGIRL03717","text":"Thrice-damned beardless son of a shite-eating hob... Where, oh where could my bloody bracelet have gone!?"},{"name":"YOUNGGIRL03717","text":"You found it? And you're returning it, too? Well, bugger my beard! Thank you ever so much─it was a gift, and I'd hate to have lost it."},{"name":"YOUNGGIRL03717","text":"A gift from who, you ask? You probably don't know him─he's a guard over at the dig site."},{"name":"YOUNGGIRL03717","text":"I had no idea that sort of job pays so well, but it must. When we met, he was a right bastard where money was concerned─I could hardly get him to pay for my ale─but of late he's been downright generous. In a much better mood, too. Oh, and so very affectionate. Mm, yes..."},{"name":"YOUNGGIRL03717","text":"Focus on the bracelet? If you insist. I don't know where he got it, though─we don't do a lot of talking."},{"name":"YOUNGGIRL03717","text":"If you're that curious, you'll have to ask him. He keeps watch over the entrance day and night, so he's not a difficult man to find."},{"name":"YOUNGGIRL03717","text":"The dig site watch's name? It's, er...hmm. You know, I never asked!"},{"name":"ANOGG","text":"Come on! Let us in, let us in!"},{"name":"KONOGG","text":"Come on! You know you want to!"},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"What I <span class=\"emphasis\">want</span> is for you two to bugger off.

That's...that's none of your concern!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"Oh, but I have a feeling that the chief will be quite concerned indeed."},{"name":"A1","text":"I recall that you have something of a history with ill-gotten gains..."},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"Hmph. <span class=\"highlight\">Doubt</span> my words all you like. I won't be intimidated by the likes of you!"},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Doubt</span> my words all you like.

How would you like that, hmm?"},{"name":"ANOGG","text":"Crack him like an egg!"},{"name":"KONOGG","text":"Go for the beard!"},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"I hope that we're finally close to catching the thief. The machine graveyard is a bothersome enough mystery without all of this nonsense."},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"...This proves nothing, you hear me? Nothiiing!"},{"name":"ANOGG","text":"Well, I don't know what you were accusing him of, but I'm absolutely sure he's guilty of it."},{"name":"KONOGG","text":"More importantly, he's made off with the key! After him!"},{"name":"ANOGG","text":"We've got you cornered!"},{"name":"KONOGG","text":"I don't think he's alone, Sister..."},{"name":"ANOGG","text":"Oh, dear. A hasty retreat does seem to be in order!"},{"name":"KONOGG","text":"Just so!"},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"That's right, surprise triplets! What now, baldling!?"},{"name":"GUARDBROTHERA03717","text":"At last, revenge!"},{"name":"GUARDBROTHERB03717","text":"In the name of our collective dinner!"},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"This is...&lt;pant&gt;...starting to feel like real work..."},{"name":"KONOGG","text":"The jig is up! Now hand over the key!"},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"Very well, I confess. I did it. Or─<span class=\"emphasis\">we</span> did it. We took turns keeping watch while the others picked over items from the dig site and sold off whatever seemed valuable."},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"And we would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for those meddling kids. Also you, however old you are."},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"I just wanted to impress her... &lt;sigh&gt; But there's no chance of that now. All I can do is grovel before the chief and hope that he doesn't punish me too harshly."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"You notice that something shiny and metallic has fallen to the ground..."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"Picking up the glimmering object, you see that it is the very key to the dig site that Anogg and Konogg were so keen to obtain."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"That's case closed, then. It's a good job that you showed up─who knows how long this farce would have continued otherwise."},{"name":"DWARFMASTER03671","text":"As for you... You won't be getting any dinner tonight, that's for certain!"},{"name":"TUNNELGUARD03671","text":"No!
