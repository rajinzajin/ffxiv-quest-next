There's something I want to talk to you about. You know I said I thought we might have a traitor in our midst─someone as was aiding the Garleans? Well, I'm thinking I may have identified our suspect."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"There's a regular of mine who used to dine on thin soup, and sip his pint on account of not being able to afford another. But of late, he's taken to ordering my best wines and the finest cuts of meat I can lay my hands on."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"Were he a merchant, I'd prob'ly think nothing of it, but this lad's a Wood Wailer."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"...And Wood Wailers don't earn that kind of coin. By chance, I was musing on where the money was coming from when you first told me about the Garleans in the forest, and I couldn't help putting two and two together."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"Suffice it to say, if a Wailer's working for the Empire, none of us is safe."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"The lad I'm talking about goes by the name of Laurentius. Last I heard, he was in the South Shroud. Find him, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, and if he <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> up to no good, put an end to it─and him, if it comes to that."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Can you not see I am on patrol? Be gone. If you have business with the Wailers, take it to the Barracks."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"You again? I told you I am busy with my duties. Now piss off!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Not long now... Hmph. To think patrol routes and rations would fetch such a price..."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"No more than I deserve, though. 'Tis little wonder the Empire has risen to such heights. If only the <span class=\"emphasis\">Wailers</span> paid men their worth..."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Y-You! What did you─? How long have you─? Help. Help! Heeelp!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Please! Come quick, my friends! It is I, Laurentius! I am under attack!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"You should have buggered off when you had the chance. Now <span class=\"emphasis\">die</span>, you interfering little swine!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"How...? How did you...? You just... I-I know nothing! I was on patrol. He just appeared! I...I thought <span class=\"emphasis\">you</span> were working for the Garleans!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Wh-Why are you following me!? Leave me be! I told you─that Garlean just appeared. I know nothing!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"How long do you mean to keep this up? What is it you imagine I've done? Enough! Enough, I say!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"It's... It's over, then. Aye, I sold maps and rations to the Empire. It was I. I meant no harm. I only wanted the coin."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"The Wailers are good. Strong. I was proud to join their ranks. <span class=\"emphasis\">Am</span> proud. But... They do not provide. They preach justice, honor, duty. But in the end, it is those with money who do as they will. Who live as they will."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"...So I sought an opportunity to change my fortunes, and took it. All I've done, I've done for money. Endangered myself, my home, everything and everyone I love...<br>Why, my actions have put your life in danger, too..."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"...Though you do not yet realize how much. Heh heh heh! Bloody idiot─did you imagine that you had cornered me? It is not <span class=\"emphasis\">I</span> who is cornered."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Garleans! I've brought the [Race] <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">bitch</span><span class=\"alternative\">bastard</span></span>!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Permit me a question, if you will. Are <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> adventurers so deluded as to believe they can challenge the power of Garlemald?"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"You would need a veritable mountain of gil to fund such an endeavor! Such is the cost of fighting great power. Or of making it. Or of <span class=\"emphasis\">remaking</span> it, as we will Gridania."},{"name":"NPC","text":"So that's the way of it. Swapped your hard bunk at the Barracks for a feather bed in Garlemald, did ye? &lt;spit&gt;"},{"name":"NPC","text":"You there, [Race]. You stand here at ol' Busc's wish, no? Then you don't stand alone."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"QIB"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Impossible... How did you best the Empire's finest? And with bandits and poachers at your side!? They are your sworn enemies! Why do they fight with you and not <span class=\"emphasis\">against</span> you!?"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"...Ah, but I know the answer only too well. Buscarron. This is <span class=\"emphasis\">his</span> doing. His words are wont to inspire men to act. Better men than I... Gods, what have I become? What have I <span class=\"emphasis\">done</span>?"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"I... I am sorry. No more will I pursue this folly. No more lies. No more bribes. I will go to the Order of the Twin Adder and confess my crimes."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"There is something I would like you to tell Buscarron. Tell him Laurentius the fool says “thank you.” I feel as though a veil has been lifted from before my eyes."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"Aye, Laurentius confessed to his crimes. I just had word from the Twin Adder. Seems he marched straight into the Nest and gave himself up."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"The lad's had quite a life, you know... His mother was killed by a brigand when he was only small. As a young man, he joined the Wailers, hoping to spare his fellow Gridanians the misery he'd known growing up."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"Trouble is, protecting Gridania's too big a job for one man, and he came to believe that he couldn't make a difference─that it was hopeless."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"There are few things more dangerous than desperation, and a man lost in the dark is easily drawn to the glimmer of coin. I reckon he thought that if he couldn't change the lot of his fellow man, he might as well change his own. Thing is, he <span class=\"emphasis\">was</span> making a difference─just not on his own. Somehow, he'd failed to grasp one simple truth─that those things we cannot do alone, we must do together."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"...Eh? He asked you to thank me, did he? Then there's good in him yet. I just hope them at the Adders' Nest are able to see it... What he's done ain't easy to forgive, but I'd like to think he'd be afforded a chance to make amends."},{"name":"BUSCARRON","text":"But let us leave fates to the Twelve. I have other news for you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. The sylph elder has been found!"},{"name":"POP","text":"A foreboding wind blows through the treetops..."},{"name":"QIB","text":"Defeat Laurentius and his party!"},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"You mean to stand against the might of the Empire with this Redbelly rabble at your side? Hah!"},{"name":"REDBERRYLEADER","text":"Your eyes betray your words, coward. You know full well the Wailers fear the Wasps' sting."},{"name":"IMPERIALLEADER","text":"After these trees drink your blood, I will see to it they are cut down and burned."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"Show them what happens to those who oppose the Empire!"},{"name":"COEURLCLAW","text":"If this is a fight Buscarron wants won, then the Coeurlclaws will fight it."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"How? Why!? You scum have no allegiances!"},{"name":"IMPERIALLEADER","text":"So, this is to be my end..."},{"name":"LAURENTIUS","text":"How...?
