Speak first with Silvairre and see what is troubling him.","Silvairre grudgingly reveals his intention to leave the guild. He is determined to bring Pawah Mujuuk to justice, believing that it will grant him a measure of redemption for the time he failed to do so as a Quiverman. Realizing that you cannot sway him from his path, you resolve to turn your attention to Leih, who seems utterly crestfallen.","As if Silvairre's announcement weren't shocking enough, Leih declares her intention to leave not only the guild, but Gridania at large. Before she departs, however, she would speak with you in private. Meet her in the South Shroud and see her off on her journey.","Leih reveals that she believed her place to be with her fellow Keepers of the Moon, and not with the people of Gridania. However, she could not bear to let Pawah murder you, and was thus denied the company of her kind. With nowhere left to go, she asks you to meet her at the Bannock, and help her to understand how one can live as an outsider in Gridania.","Leih flies into a rage and attacks you, leaving you little choice but to fight, as a crowd of slack-jawed Twin Adder recruits look on. After you subdue her, she awakens as if from a trance, realizing that the fear of dishonoring her old family, who perished in the Calamity, was preventing her from embracing her new one. She resolves to return to the guild and be with those who know her best. Follow in her wake and inform Luciane that all is well.","Before you can utter a word, Luciane bids you stop, and states that merely looking at the returning Leih's eyes has told her all that she needs to know. She thanks you for helping Leih to see that her place is with the guild, and hopes that you will be of similar aid to other archers who lose their way.<br><br>※The next archer quest will be available from Luciane upon reaching level 30."],"objectives":["Speak with Silvairre.","Speak with Leih Aliapoh.","Meet Leih Aliapoh in the South Shroud.","Speak with Leih Aliapoh at the Bannock.","Report to Luciane.","Defeat Leih Aliapoh!"],"dialogue":[{"name":"LUCIANE","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I had hoped you would come. You may be able to help. I am concerned about Leih and Silvairre..."},{"name":"LUCIANE","text":"They show signs of losing perspective, and... Well, mayhap it is best you see for yourself. I cannot help but feel that both would benefit from your counsel."},{"name":"LUCIANE","text":"Consider this a personal request, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"Hm? Oh, <span class=\"emphasis\">gods</span>... Did Luciane send you to pester me, by any chance? This is hardly her concern, and it is most <span class=\"emphasis\">definitely</span> not yours."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"If you must know, I have decided to leave the guild."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"I mean to track down Pawah Mujuuk and finish what we started. The Gods' Quiver and Wood Wailers seem content to ignore our warnings, but I will not let her escape again."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"I already made that mistake once, and it cost me my place in the Gods' Quiver."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"Aye, the foolish young sentry of whom I once spoke─he was me. &lt;sigh&gt; We had her, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. There was no escape. But then she began to wail about a wounded comrade, one who would surely die without her help... She looked me straight in the eye and <span class=\"emphasis\">begged</span>..."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"And I blinked. I failed to see through the most elementary ruse. I failed Gridania and the Gods' Quiver...and while that can never be forgiven, mayhap I can reclaim a measure of honor by stopping her."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"...But a wanderer like you would not understand what it means to betray your people."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"Worry not─I do not intend to leave just yet. I will continue to gather information until I am certain of Mujuuk's whereabouts. Make no mistake, though─it is only a matter of time."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"Now run along, will you? Oh, and if you are so concerned about your fellow guildmates, you should attend to that moping Miqo'te. The sight of her shuffling around whilst staring at her feet is bad for morale."},{"name":"SILVAIRRE","text":"...Not that it matters to me."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Oh...it's you. Tell me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, do you ever think about home? Do you ever wish you could go back?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Mine was just another poor village in the Twelveswood. The fields were more stone than soil, and merchants hardly ever bothered to visit. We didn't have a lot...but we didn't need it."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"And then the Calamity came. I remember running, and the screams... It was so <span class=\"emphasis\">loud</span>, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>...so unbearably loud... And then I was here, in a strange city, surrounded by more people than I'd ever seen, and I didn't know any of them."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"But I knew how to hunt. I was always good at hunting, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, and the guild gave me a place to get better."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"At least I thought I had gotten better. She...Pawah Mujuuk...she was so much more..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"I've been thinking, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, that maybe this is a sign. Maybe Silvairre is right, and this guild─this city─is no place for an outsider like me."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"And so I've decided to leave. I'm glad to have known you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, even if it was only for a short while."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Forgive me if this is too selfish a request, but before I go, I would like to meet with you one last time."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Alone, in the South Shroud. These...Gridanians would not understand."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"No! Don't hurt <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>!"},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"And there I was, thinkin' ye mightn't accept my kind invitation!"},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"...I don't recall invitin' <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>, though... 'Tis <span class=\"emphasis\">rude</span> to presume, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">missy</span><span class=\"alternative\">sonny</span></span>, an' I do so hate rudeness..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Wait! It's not <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> fault─it's mine! I invited <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span>'s a member of the Archers' Guild, like me─and <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span>'s not Gridanian!"},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"Ahhh...I do begin to recall <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> face... Aye, knows how to hold a bow, that one. Well, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> ain't the typical recruit, but I reckon I might be willin' to make an exception."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"No, no─it's not like that. I just...I wanted to say good-bye."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, ever since I met Pawah, I've been at a loss. But I realize now that my place isn't at the guild...with the Gridanians."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"They'll never accept me. This is where I belong, with <span class=\"emphasis\">my</span> people, carrying on our traditions. Our archery─not Gridania's."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"It's all I have left, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. So I'm going with Pawah. Maybe you don't understand now, but...just promise me you won't tell Luciane...or Silvairre."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"As you wish."},{"name":"A1","text":"The hells I won't!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>..."},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"Made yer peace with yer little friend, have ye? Right then, let's get on with it!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>!"},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"Heh! I had a feelin' <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">she</span><span class=\"alternative\">he</span></span> might be harborin' a few nigglin' objections. Worry not, sister..."},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Put an arrow in her</span><span class=\"alternative\">Shoot the bastard</span></span>!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"NO!"},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"Ain't no love lost 'twixt ye an' the guild, is there? Then what's the problem with featherin' a bloody 'venturer? No bugger'll miss <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">I'll</span> miss <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span>, all right!? So just...just stop!"},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"Dear me... An' I had such high hopes for you, Miss Aliapoh... Waste o' bloody time! A Keeper what's lost her nerve's about as much use to me as a glass bow."},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"But there's no sport in killin' captured prey."},{"name":"PAWAHMUJUUK","text":"Ack! I'd better not see neither o' ye again, 'cause if I do, I'll show ye what happens to prey what's daft enough to get caught twice. Away, sisters! Away!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"How do you do it, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? How do you live in this place─with these people?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"And why do you even bother? What have they ever given you beside scorn? Well? What do you <span class=\"emphasis\">see</span> in them, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Even though you joined the guild after I did, you've come so far, so quickly. Maybe you've even surpassed me..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"I have to know how you've done it. I have to know what it is that I'm doing wrong..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"...And there's only one way I can think of to find out. Meet me at the Bannock."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Shall we begin, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>?"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Whenever you're ready. I'll be waiting."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Then defend yourself! Show me what these people have taught you!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; It's so simple..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"You have opened your eyes, and looked beyond your masters' faults. You've accepted their teachings and taken them to heart. Even Silvairre, for all his bigotry, wishes only to preserve his traditions."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"I lost sight of everyone else's struggles and became obsessed with mine own. I was so afraid to let go of my cherished notion of archery─my <span class=\"emphasis\">family's</span> notion─and learn another way. I didn't want to betray them...or dishonor their memory."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"...But I have a family here too─a family that sees the wider world, and is willing to show me how blinkered I have become."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"As archers, we train our eyes and minds to be unforgiving─to defy any attempt at concealment, and discern the naked truth. It is little wonder then that I have neglected to look inside myself until now. Though unquestionably worthwhile, I have found the experience rather...<span class=\"emphasis\">excruciating</span>. Ahem!"},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. I know now that I belong at the guild, together with you and Luciane..."},{"name":"LEIHALIAPOH","text":"...And, yes, even that bloody Wildwood.
