Thank the gods. I have a favor to ask, and the others would never let me live this down if they were to find out."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"I've met someone, you see, and in the most peculiar of places─on the battlefield! No, she isn't an imperial soldier, but a ravishing Resistance fighter. After asking around, it seems she's stationed near the Yawn on the path toward the Peaks."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"But in our line of work tomorrow is never a certainty. To lose her before making my feelings known would be more than my heart can bear."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"That is why I would ask you to take this letter. Take it and deliver it to my dear sweet Athala."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"My heart is still spinning from our first meeting. Please take that letter to my dear sweet Athala. She must know how I feel."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"How can I help you, adventurer?"},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"A letter from...Kakalai? &lt;gasp&gt; Can it be? The dashing young soldier who rescued me? I can't believe it!"},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"From the moment I laid eyes on him I knew it was fate. Would you like to hear the tale of our meeting? Of two brave souls on the battlefield of love?"},{"name":"CHOICE2Q1","text":"What will you do?"},{"name":"CHOICE2A1","text":"Nod politely while considering how to spend your tomestones."},{"name":"CHOICE2A2","text":"Prepare for the tale of a small man with a big heart."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"All of my unit lay dead or dying around me, and the Garleans were closing in. The glint of their swords in the high noon sun was blinding. Despite my training, I felt infinitely small in an endless sea of carnage and chaos."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"In all my time as a conjurer I have never struck a blow against an enemy. There was always some ploy at my disposal, a clever use of the terrain to outmaneuver my enemies. But the barren lands of Gyr Abania would afford me no such luxury."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"I stood precariously on a knife's edge and could feel I would soon fall. I dared not look to see what was waiting for me below. My only thought was I wanted to live. I wanted to live!"},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"The imperial sword came crashing down. I braced myself for the end. What filled the air next was not my cries of agony, but the sweet song of steel against steel. I then opened my eyes to an amazing sight. At first I thought it a bean sprout jumping furiously to and fro, but lo and behold, it was Kakalai!"},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"I began casting healing magicks and I could not take my eyes off him. He was poetry in motion."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"Before long the imperials all lay defeated. The only sound to be heard was his labored breathing and mine."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"He then ran off to join the fray elsewhere, but for one moment─one magical moment─our eyes met. When I looked into those glorious emerald green eyes of his, I knew he was the one."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"My sweet angel still lives. And to think he would send me such a letter!"},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"After losing my parents twenty years ago I had always been filled with such hate, such anger. All I lived for was revenge against the Garleans."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"But those days are done. Love has found me and I will never let it go! Here, would you take this flower to him? Tell him I would bask in his love like this blossom in sunlight."},{"name":"ATHALA","text":"Oh, how I long for the day when I can hold him in my arms once more."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"Did you find her? Did you deliver the note?"},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"A flower?"},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"A stock! They say it symbolizes the bonds of love, you know."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"My sweet, sweet Athala. Would you like to hear of how we met? Of how I came to meet an angel on the battlefield?"},{"name":"CHOICE2Q1","text":"What will you do?"},{"name":"CHOICE2A1","text":"Nod politely while planning your escape from the conversation."},{"name":"CHOICE2A2","text":"Listen closely to the tale of the angel and her healing hands."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"My unit had been crushed utterly by a magitek menace set upon us by the imperials. It was all I could do to escape. I honestly had no idea where I was going. I only knew that death was at my back. Before I knew it, I was careening into a soldier, and I instinctively readied my blade."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"I defeated him with relative ease, but sadly he was not alone. More soldiers beyond counting stood before me, and a mechanical monster still giving chase behind. In that moment I grew tired of it all. Tired of running, tired of living. So I rushed headlong into the throng of soldiers."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"I swung my sword wildly, caring not for the blows they made against me. Where there should have been pain, there was only a soothing breeze blowing against my back. I felt reinvigorated, and so I kept fighting down to the last man. It was only then that I looked back."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"What I saw there behind me I can describe only as perfection. The gods must have grown jealous of her beauty and cast her down from the heavens."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"But my sweet angel was not yet free from danger. The magitek drone was still following me. So I ran before it was close enough to open fire on the both of us. "},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"I ran and ran until I found a support unit of the Allied forces. I was safe...and in love."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"It is unfair to say that I saved her. No, she is the one who saved me. When next we receive our wages I will have to get her something."},{"name":"KAKALAI","text":"A ring, perhaps..."}],"reward":{"gil":601,"xp":120150},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":69,"id":34}],"questsType":"all","quests":[68083,68405]},"next":[68409]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1019518","obj":{"i":1019518,"n":"Kakalai","l":2406,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020832","obj":{"i":1020832,"n":"Athala","l":2406,"q":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68083","obj":{"i":68083,"n":"The Lady in Red","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1070}},{"type":"quest","id":"68405","obj":{"i":68405,"n":"Dearest Daughter","g":103,"l":"Rhalgr's Reach","s":9020}},{"type":"quest","id":"68409","obj":{"i":68409,"n":"My Dear Brother","g":104,"l":"The Fringes","s":9030}}]}
