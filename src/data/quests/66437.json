The bait is her very own karakul, Sebastian. But first, he must be captured with a length of brambleweed rope.","Take the bound karakul to Providence Point and leave him at the decoy point.","With the bait set, all that remains is for the trap to be sprung. Hide yourself away and wait for the unwitting prey. Be ready to strike as soon as the ogre appears, or Sebastian will pay the price.","The ogre is dead, and the poor karakul is safe, though trembling and wide-eyed. Unbind him that he may return to his mistress.","You have unbound the bound Sebastian, and he seems grateful to be free...and alive. Make your way back to Camp Dragonhead to speak with Ser Yaelle.","Unlikely though it may seem, Sebastian has beaten you back to Ser Yaelle, as she informs you that she just finished brushing the brave karakul. The ogre will devour no more of the commonfolk's flock, and Ser Yaelle is well pleased."],"objectives":["Capture Sebastian with brambleweed rope.","Tether Sebastian to the decoy spot.","Lurk out of sight and slay the muttonmaw ogre.","Let Sebastian loose.","Report to Yaelle."],"dialogue":[{"name":"YAELLE","text":"Adventurer, I hear you like a good hunt!
