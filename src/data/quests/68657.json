We are currently in the process of building several more, but I fear their worth is significantly reduced if there are no bearers to parade them around..."},{"name":"KOFUINSEIGETSU","text":"Thankfully, in this case, my people are a simple breed. By merely demonstrating the majestic spectacle of our mikoshi in their immediate vicinity, they will soon clamor for the honor of bearing the load."},{"name":"KOFUINSEIGETSU","text":"Go now to Gyotaku, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Claim a mikoshi, and soar across the steppe to where our gatherers toil on the edges of Nhaama's Retreat. The allure of your resounding “wasshoi” will not be denied!"},{"name":"GYOTAKU","text":"Ready for your mikoshi? Up you go, then! Give those boys and girls a good “wasshoi” from me!"},{"name":"GYOTAKU","text":"When the others returned with the mikoshi, I had thought your task successfully completed. But it seems you simply hopped down...or tumbled off. Here, why don't you try again, and keep a tighter grip this time, yes, yes?"},{"name":"DAILYNAMAZUO03121A","text":"How colorful and festive! When do <span class=\"emphasis\">we</span> ever get to scatter confetti with wild abandon?"},{"name":"DAILYNAMAZUO03121B","text":"All we earn from this job is dry skin and skinned fins! We should head back and sign up to be mikoshi bearers!"},{"name":"DAILYNAMAZUO03121C","text":"Oh, have you come to lift our spirits!? Banish the drabness? There truly is nothing worth collecting around here..."},{"name":"DAILYNAMAZUO03121D","text":"Just Namazu-colored sand...and more Namazu-colored sand. I can't take this anymore! I quit! “Mikoshi bearer” is my true calling!"},{"name":"DAILYNAMAZUO03121E","text":"Oho! What a lively crew! Rambunctious! And here we are working our fins to the gristle..."},{"name":"DAILYNAMAZUO03121F","text":"Why don't <span class=\"emphasis\">we</span> join the mikoshi bearers and enjoy ourselves for a change? Anything's better than grubbing in the mud! Yes, yes!"},{"name":"DAILYNAMAZUO03121G","text":"We Namazu were hatched to enjoy life─not slave away at these dreary chores! I want an exciting job like the mikoshi bearers!"},{"name":"DAILYNAMAZUO03121H","text":"Me too! This gathering nonsense can sink in the river for all I care!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"These Namazu are busy harvesting supplies for the festival. Speak with Gyotaku at Dhoro Iloh to mount a mikoshi, and perform a rousing Wasshoi for the Namazu gatherers."},{"name":"KOFUINSEIGETSU","text":"The effect of your demonstration has been all but instantaneous─we have already accepted several applications for our bearer positions. &lt;sigh&gt; The fact that my kin are so easily influenced is a blessing on occasion."},{"name":"KOFUINSEIGETSU","text":"I have it on good authority, however, that the physical labor of a mikoshi bearer takes a terrible toll on the body. We shall have shirkers and deserters aplenty within the week, and will soon be calling again upon your powers of persuasion..."}],"reward":{"gil":615,"reputation":60,"items":[{"id":22525}]},"reqs":{"beastrank":5,"jobs":[{"lvl":60,"id":35}]}},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1025602","obj":{"i":1025602,"n":"Seigetsu The Enlightened","l":2411,"q":28}},{"type":"item","id":"22525","obj":{"i":22525,"n":"Namazu Koban","l":1,"c":65064,"t":100}}]}
