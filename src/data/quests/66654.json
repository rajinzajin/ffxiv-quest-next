Sisipu has bid you speak with Sybell, who may possess more information, as the Brugaire Consortium has close ties to the Maelstrom.","Sybell relates to you the legend of Swallowtail Roam, in which Llymlaen imprisoned a fearsome sea serpent that threatened to flood the whole of creation, thus giving rise to the Lominsan motto “till sea swallows all.” Though it is unlikely that the serpent spotted was the beast of eld, it has nevertheless sparked a panic to which the Maelstrom has been forced to respond. To discern the true nature of the beast, Sybell suggests seeking out the source of the sea serpent rumors, Chuchuroon.","Chuchuroon mentions having shared his story with Wawalago, who has a demonstrated knack for deciphering the Qiqirn's observations. Speak with the netmaster and see what he has to say.","Wawalago believes a Mazlaya marlin can clear up the misunderstanding. However, the act of catching one will require double mooching, one of the most difficult techniques a fisher<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> can employ. Use a goby ball to catch a quality harbor herring along north Bloodshore, recast the herring to catch an ogre barracuda, then recast the barracuda to at last catch a Mazlaya marlin. Once accomplished, deliver your prize to Sisipu at the Fishermen's Guild.","You and your associates meet with Grand Storm Marshal Eynzahr Slafyrsyn aboard one of the Brugaire Consortium's vessels, where you present to him the Mazlaya marlin. The grand storm marshal subsequently reveals that while he never believed the rumors to be true, he required evidence before he could lift the ban─evidence which you so skillfully acquired. Having put an end to the sea serpent panic, speak with Sisipu to hear her thoughts on what has transpired.","Sisipu is uncharacteristically grateful and complimentary, noting that you have saved the Lominsan fishing industry from financial ruin at the hands of an imaginary sea serpent. She is especially pleased by what she believes might be your single greatest contribution to the Fishermen's Guild: luring Wawalago back to work.<br><br>※The next fisher quest will be available from Sisipu once you have completed the main scenario quest “Before the Dawn.”"],"objectives":["Speak with Sybell.","Speak with Chuchuroon.","Speak with Wawalago.","Deliver a Mazlaya marlin to Sisipu.","Report to Sisipu."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Gods, this is unbelievable! According to the age-old adage, “When the going gets tough, the tough go fishing.” Unfortunately, the adage is of little use when the “tough going” happens to be a fishing ban!"},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"&lt;sigh&gt; You haven't heard, have you? Eynzahr Slafyrsyn has closed all docks and ports for fishing vessels on the authority of Admiral Merlwyb."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Some sorry sailor supposedly spotted a serpent at sea, and so Slafyrsyn stated that, for our safety, all our services must cease."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"It's all so frustrating! Well, we may be a group of sedentary fishers, but we're not about to take this sitting down!"},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"First, we'll need to know what we're up against. The Brugaire Consortium maintains ties to the Maelstrom, so Sybell may know something we do not. It is time to go fishing...for information."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"It's certainly a pleasure to see you again, though I wish it were under happier circumstances. The news came as a shock to us, as well."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Any Lominsan who's ever boarded a boat has heard the tale. Back when the world was naught but a dry, lifeless rock, Llymlaen created a giant serpent. From its massive maw, the creature spat forth water until the land was filled."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"But it would not stop. To prevent the world from being completely submerged, the Navigator trapped the serpent in a floating island with the warning that if it were ever to be freed, the seas would rise until the world ended. This is from where the thalassocratic motto “till sea swallows all” comes. You can imagine the Admiral's surprise upon learning a sailor claims to actually have <span class=\"emphasis\">seen</span> the serpent in question."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"While you and I may recognize it as a faerie tale aimed to scare children, the panic in the streets is real, and so Slafyrsyn hasn't any choice but to take drastic measures in order to maintain the peace. Regrettably, those drastic measures have dire consequences for both your guild and my consortium."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"And the Maelstrom is too occupied with ship inaugurations to conduct a proper inquiry, meaning our only hope is to take matters into our own firm-yet-supple hands. Ahem."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"It may be impossible to prove the sea serpent does not exist, but perhaps the testimony of the eyewitness could be impugned."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"I believe you have met the sailor responsible for the sighting─the one known as Chuchuroon."},{"name":"CHUCHUROON","text":"Chuchuroon see big fish at sea, some say see sea serpent!"},{"name":"CHUCHUROON","text":"Chuchuroon just want fish to fish, see fisherman Wawalago about fishing fish in sea."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Unless we can disprove the existence of that serpent, I fear this bodes ill for Limsa."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"I've seen enough at sea to know when sailors are seeing things, and what Chuchuroon saw was no sea serpent, for sure."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Missing your marks will make mountains out of molehills─distances deceive and delude the minds of men at sea."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"My money says your serpent is a Mazlaya marlin─a fairly big fish, but by no means a monster."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"You can see them barreling back and forth along the north of Bloodshore."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"But if spied from the shore, people will just shrug their shoulders. You need to make them meet that marlin up close and personal."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"I'll admit it's easier expressed than executed, and I've never nabbed one. If you don't loosen up your line, they'll rip your rod right out of your hands!"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"But first, you need a bite! They won't waste their breath on worms from other waters. Mazlaya marlin demand mooching─more familiar to you as fishwheeling, perhaps."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"And not just any mean act of mooching, but the daunting duty of the dramatic <span class=\"emphasis\">double</span> mooch! I reckon you're ready for it."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Get a goby ball and haul in a harbor herring. Once you've hitched your herring, offer it up to an ogre barracuda, then bait that beast to make the Mazlaya marlin bite."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Makes me want to sail out myself, but Slafyrsyn would slay any guildmaster who slights him."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Besides, I'm sure Sisipu would sooner see you succeed at it."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Gah! I can't believe we're reduced to this! Still, while Wawalago's never been right for running a guild, he's never been wrong about a fish. If he says our serpent is a Mazlaya marlin, that's what it is."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">That's</span> the marlin!? I can see how some might mistake it for a monster!"},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Hopefully, Slafyrsyn will see it the same. Come─Sybell arranged for us to speak with the grand storm marshal."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"So many moons has it been, I can scarcely remember the last time I boarded a merchant ship for anything other than an inspection."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"Quite comfortable indeed aboard the luxurious fleet of the Brugaire Consortium. No doubt to put crooked mongers and traffickers at ease while making illicit deals at sea?"},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Perish the thought! We would never dream of calling the grand storm marshal to a vessel where such roguery took place."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"A shame─I'd imagine those sort of vessels were the most fun. I suppose we'd then best tend to business."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"Of course, sir."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Allow me to introduce to you the Mazlaya marlin."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"Great Llymlaen's Ghost! The blary thing is massive! However did you catch it?"},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"...Though I suppose that doesn't matter. At any rate, it is your contention that this marlin is our sea serpent?"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"You can sing yourself to sleep with that silly sea serpent story, but it still won't hold water!"},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"I knew things were proceeding too smoothly. You always know just the wrong time to act the guildmaster, don't you?"},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"Never you mind. I've known Wawalago long enough not to mind his manners. Unlike his fish, I know when I'm being baited."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"Boy, you've been baiting and bullying us with your ban─will you let up and lift it?"},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"A fine question. To lift the fishing ban? Or to not lift the fishing ban...? What to do, what to do, what to do...?"},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"On one hand, I could lift the ban... But on the other..."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Now who's the one baiting?"},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"Why not? Of course, there are formalities we must observe, so I'm afraid the declaration will have to wait until the morrow."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"And...the ban <span class=\"emphasis\">will</span> be lifted, won't it?"},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"Unless you'd prefer it weren't."},{"name":"SYBELL","text":"By no means, it's just... I feared that simply bringing you a large fish might fail to serve as adequate evidence in overturning a formal military promulgation."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"Well, I never really believed all this sea serpent silliness in the first place. It was more about putting Lominsans' minds at ease than anything else, and the marlin you've brought me should accomplish just that."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"A few of our more paranoid conspiracy theorists in the Maelstrom alleged the serpent to be part of an elaborate Sahagin plot, so this should make for a nice laugh at their expense, as well."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"And to think, this all started because someone spotted a “large fish.”"},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"And because fish tales are wont to grow in size, the “large fish” became “serpent-sized,” and then ceased to be a fish altogether!"},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"It makes you wonder about what other sorts of overblown fantasies we've all been led to believe."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"It sounds like you were ready to lift the ban whether we brought you the marlin or not."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"If only it were that simple! A fine grand storm marshal I would be if I went lifting bans willy-nilly without any evidence the problem had been solved! This marlin is essential to assuaging the irrational fears of the public."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Well, then I suppose <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>'s efforts weren't for naught, after all. I only wonder how the fish tale grew out of proportion in the first place."},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"I don't delight in delving into details, but that deed might have been my doing..."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Why am I not surprised?"},{"name":"WAWALAGO","text":"When I mentioned to Chuchuroon that the Mazlaya marlin was a monster, I meant it metaphorically, but mayhap he misunderstood..."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"I think it would be in the best interests of all involved if I don't hear any more of this story."},{"name":"EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN","text":"The Maelstrom expresses its gratitude for your efforts in bringing this evidence to light. Your guild will be notified when the fishing ban is formally lifted. I bid you good day."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Terrifying to think a little exaggeration can get out of hand, particularly when you consider how often fishermen exaggerate."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"But it sounds like Slafyrsyn knew something was fishy all along."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Nevertheless, you saved our guild from destruction at the hands of an imaginary sea serpent!"},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"Funny how N'nmulika delivered you to our doorstep just when we needed you most."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"And I certainly can't consider you a guppy anymore, now that you've caught a marlin the guildmaster himself never quite reeled in."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"I'd say we name you the guildmaster, but then Wawalago would have nothing to dodge, and I'm not ready to let that fish off the hook so easily."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"But I suppose we could at least let him know he has a rival."},{"name":"SISIPU","text":"And that might be your finest fishing accomplishment of all: luring Wawalago back to work!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This concludes the fisher quests for FINAL FANTASY XIV: A Realm Reborn.
