They're waiting for you, I'm sure!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"The others have returned as well, it would seem."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"We won...we actually won! I mean, you did. If it were not for you..."},{"name":"DORBEI","text":"I...I took a wound. But it will heal with time and care. The children are gathering herbs for a poultice."},{"name":"DORBEI","text":"Had the Naadam lasted much longer, I may not have survived. Thank you."},{"name":"MOLA02514","text":"I saw you fight, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! You were incredible!"},{"name":"MOLB02514","text":"My arms, my legs, everything is tired and sore. I feel as though I could sleep for a day..."},{"name":"MOLC02514","text":"Where did you learn such feats? Is everyone in the West as strong as you? Can you teach me!?"},{"name":"MOLD02514","text":"Stop fidgeting and let me set the bone! You're only making it worse for yourself!"},{"name":"MOLE02514","text":"&lt;pant&gt; &lt;pant&gt; I know, I know! Just...just give me a moment!"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Ah, but it would be rude of me to monopolize your attention. Doubtless there are others who would speak with you."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Let us go and greet Temulun Khatun."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I hope everyone is all right...or alive, at least."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Temulun Khatun! We are returned, and victorious!"},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Ah...mayhap you should speak with the khatun instead of me. That is why we are here, is it not?"},{"name":"TEMULUN","text":"Welcome, warriors of the Steppe. It is an honor to receive you once more."},{"name":"TEMULUN","text":"We observed the battle from a distance, and marked the moment of your triumph. In that instant, I wept tears of joy."},{"name":"TEMULUN","text":"Not only did you bring us victory in the Naadam, but you ensured that every one of my kinsmen returned with their lives."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Some were more gravely wounded than others, but none were lost to us. We could not have asked for anything more."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"If it is not too much of an imposition, would you be willing to go and speak with them? A simple gesture for those with whom you shared the battlefield."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"You really shouldn't... I mean, I'm glad you're all right, but we had our own reasons for fighting, and it feels wrong to be thanked for that..."},{"name":"HIEN","text":"Hahaha! The pleasure and the pain that can only come in the wake of a battle. I know it well."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"How long it has been since last I saw young men and women celebrating a hard-fought victory... Let us pray we enjoy a similar sign in Yanxia soon."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Please, it would mean a great deal to the others if you were to go and speak with them again."},{"name":"TEMULUN","text":"For the Mol to triumph in the Naadam with the aid of outsiders. The Steppe will not soon forget this day."},{"name":"MOLA02514","text":"Some part of me still struggles to believe it, but we won! We defeated the Oronir and the Dotharl and won!"},{"name":"MOLA02514","text":"When they appeared before us I was filled with such fear as I had never known. But then I saw you charge with Cirina and the others, and before I knew it, I was running and shouting..."},{"name":"MOLA02514","text":"I will carry the memory of that moment with me always. As well as the moment when you became one with the ovoo and were declared khagan!"},{"name":"MOLA02514","text":"The <span class=\"highlight\">victorypose</span> you struck was a sight to behold! I say, would you be willing to show us again?"},{"name":"MOLA02514","text":"It is a silly thing to ask, I know, but I must! Please, will you not show us again your grand <span class=\"highlight\">victorypose</span>?"},{"name":"MOLC02514","text":"Aye, that's the stuff of legends! That's the khagan in all <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> splendor!"},{"name":"MOLA02514","text":"Praise be to the khagan, and to the gods for guiding <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">him</span></span> to us!"},{"name":"MOLD02514","text":"Glory to the khagan and <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> comrades!

They really, really love you!"},{"name":"HIEN","text":"It is good that they can delight in such simple things as the dramatic posings of a comrade."},{"name":"GOSETSU","text":"Like the child and the father, the student and the master, all men need an ideal for which to strive."},{"name":"MOLA02514","text":"How impressive! I shall have to practice with my own weapons until I can do the same!"},{"name":"MOLB02514","text":"I could hear the others cheering. What did I miss? Is there to be a feast or some other celebration?"},{"name":"MOLC02514","text":"How I envy you, khagan! You could court the <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">man</span><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span></span> of your choice!"},{"name":"MOLD02514","text":"Have a care that it heals properly. There is much work to be done, and you will be needed."},{"name":"MOLE02514","text":"Yes, yes, I know...even in victory we must look to the future."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Ah, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I am told you gave the young warriors a fine show!"},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Grandmother and I have been discussing how we might best express our gratitude to you. Mere words did not seem sufficient."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"This is a morin khuur─a traditional instrument of our people."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"The feats of our greatest heroes, like Bardam and Chakha, are preserved in song. Yours too will live on for years to come."},{"name":"CIRINA","text":"Perhaps one day you might learn how to play it! But, even if not, you may look on the morin khuur and remember this time, this place.
