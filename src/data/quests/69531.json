{"quest":{"name":"All Clowns' Wake","location":"Gridania","id":69531,"patch":6.0,"sort":218,"icon":101142,"eventIcon":71221,"issuer":1035245,"target":1035252,"genre":203,"journal":["The Adventurers' Guild investigator is on the lookout for a suspiciously scary personage.<br>※This quest is available for a limited time only.","The Adventurers' Guild investigator relates to you his plight: as All Saints' Eve approaches, a shifty figure known as the Scarlet Snout has been making the rounds about Gridania, unsettling the local populace. Sadly, the investigator's best efforts have turned up little in the way of leads as to what this individual is up to. At his behest, you agree to aid him in his quest by inquiring among the locals in hopes of learning more about this red-nosed ruffian.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","Through your inquiries with the townspeople─some more cooperative than others─it soon becomes apparent that the Scarlet Snout has made contact with several individuals, inviting more than a few of them to a banquet of sorts. Concerned for their fate, you begin to make your way back to Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre to relate to the guild investigator all that has transpired.","After conferring with the investigator, you agree that the best course of action is for you to attempt to initiate contact with the Scarlet Snout yourself. At your client's behest, you set out to lie in wait by the river near the Leatherworkers' Guild until the man with the protuberant proboscis approaches you.","Sure enough, the so-called Scarlet Snout─now revealed to be an itinerant clown by the name of Papa Gruff─finds you and extends an invitation to his banquet, much as he did with the other residents of Gridania. Unable to yet discern whether he means well or ill, you head back to the Leatherworkers' Guild to inform the investigator of your meeting and discuss your next course of action.","Hearing your story, the Adventurers' Guild investigator is duly suspicious, but nevertheless suggests playing along with your quarry, that you might obtain more concrete information. So it is that you make for Bentbranch Meadows, where you will seek out a vantage point a stone's throw from the agreed-upon location, that you might spy upon Papa Gruff and his interactions with his other guests from a safe distance.","As you survey the scene, it does not take long for the entire Gruff clan to appear. A chill runs up your spine as you overhear them discussing their dark plot to realize something called the Night of Devilry by feeding on the fear and life energies of their guests. Somewhat shaken, you decide to return to the investigator and elucidate to him this rather disturbing turn of events.","The investigator is to no small degree concerned, but at the same time assures you that the Adventurers' Guild has sent aid in the form of an expert on all matters occult. Going off to see to your preparations, you agree to return to the investigator when you are ready to meet the man in question and see what perfect plan he has devised."],"objectives":["Ask the locals in New Gridania about the Scarlet Snout.","Ask the locals in Old Gridania about the Scarlet Snout.","Speak with the Adventurers' Guild investigator.","Lie in wait at the designated location.","Speak with the Adventurers' Guild investigator.","Lie in wait at the designated location.","Speak with the Adventurers' Guild investigator."],"dialogue":[{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Ah, we meet again! You're the adventurer who so kindly assisted with me with my investigation in years past, yes? Truth be told, your timing couldn't be better─there's a small matter I could use your help with should you have a moment to spare."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"As you can well see from the decorations about town, All Saints' Wake is nearly upon us. And I am pleased to report that this year, at least, I have seen no sign of those fiends from the Continental Circus as of yet."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Hello there, friend. You have the look of a seasoned adventurer about you─and I would know, what with my superior powers of deduction. If you could spare the time, I could use your assistance in a matter I'm investigating at the moment."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Oh, thank you! Pray tell me: are you familiar with the Continental Circus?"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"The people of Eorzea know them as a traveling troupe of entertainers who visit whenever All Saints' Wake is upon us. However, in actuality they are a band of voidsent fiends in disguise."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"That is not to say they get up to anything that goes beyond the realm of mere mischief. No, they are generally harmless, which is why I have been content to observe them from afar. Bizarrely I am yet to see any sign of them this time round despite the festivities being so close at hand."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"That said, I do not mean to say that things have been uneventful of late. A rather peculiar gentleman known as the Scarlet Snout has appeared to fill the vacuum of absurdity left by the Circus."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Most suspicious as I'm sure you will agree. Which is why I set about investigating the matter, however things have not quite gone to plan and I was hoping you might be able to help me look into this strange character."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Do you think you could spare some time to ask the residents of Gridania about the Scarlet Snout?"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Ah, you have my thanks. I shall continue to do my part in the meantime. Pray alert me should you learn aught of interest."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Ah, you have my thanks. I shall continue to do my part in the meantime. Pray alert me should you learn aught of interest."},{"name":"CITIZENA03995","text":"Can't say I've seen anyone matching that description myself, but now that you mention it...I remember a friend of mine saying she saw an odd character wandering about here the other day."},{"name":"CITIZENA03995","text":"It stuck with me because she said he was dressed up in odd garb─almost like that of a jester. I can't guarantee that was the man you're looking for, but it sounds too similar to be a coincidence, yes?"},{"name":"CITIZENB03995","text":"...Ah. So you're looking for this so-called Scarlet Snout as well, are you? Well, tough luck─I'm going to beat you to him!"},{"name":"CITIZENB03995","text":"See, I've heard that he's a well-heeled bloke who loves nothing more than to share his fortune with his friends. Ever since then, I've been searching high and low for him. Even if I did know anything, damned if I'm going to share it with anyone!"},{"name":"CITIZENC03995","text":"A fellow with a red nose? Wh-Why, no. I've heard nothing of such a man! And I most <span class=\"emphasis\">certainly</span> haven't been invited to a holiday feast organized by such an individual! Perish the thought!"},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"About this <span class=\"emphasis\">feast</span>..."},{"name":"A1","text":"You look as if you've seen a ghost."},{"name":"CITIZENC03995","text":"All right, all right! I'll tell you all I know. I was heading home from an errand when this fellow with a most prominent proboscis approaches me and asks if I'd visit him at his house. Said he needed someone to share his toys and sweets with."},{"name":"CITIZENC03995","text":"At the same time, he made me assure him that I would tell no one of this offer─or that he even spoke to me at all. If he found out about this, I don't know what would happen. Promise me you won't tell anyone else!"},{"name":"CITIZEND03995","text":"A man with a red nose? Psst...listen. This is just between the two of us."},{"name":"CITIZEND03995","text":"Aye, I've met the man of whom you speak. In fact, he even invited me to a banquet of sorts. Yes, I was relaxing by the river the other night, when I suddenly heard a voice that I couldn't quite place."},{"name":"CITIZEND03995","text":"I turned around to see a man dressed in motley standing behind me. We got to talking─befitting his appearance, he's quite the jovial fellow─and after a pleasant little chat, he invited me to dinner at his home in the coming days."},{"name":"CITIZEND03995","text":"I called it a banquet, but he assured me that it would be a modest affair with only him and a few of his newfound friends. He also swore me to secrecy─no doubt he doesn't want strangers to come and crash the event. So don't tell anyone else I told you about this, all right?"},{"name":"CITIZENA03995","text":"Did you have any luck finding the man you seek? My apologies for not being able to tell you more─my friend only saw the fellow in jester's garb the once."},{"name":"CITIZENB03995","text":"Have I met the Scarlet Snout? Maybe I didn't, but maybe I did! Either way, I'm not going to tell you anything!"},{"name":"CITIZENC03995","text":"Look, don't tell anyone what I told you, okay? If the red-nosed fellow found out and rescinded the invitation, I'd be devastated!"},{"name":"CITIZEND03995","text":"Promise me you'll say nothing about the banquet to anyone. I wonder what sort of food he means to serve..."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Ah, you're back. Did you glean anything of interest, perchance?"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Inviting total strangers to his abode and swearing them to secrecy? Most suspicious, indeed. Yes, I highly doubt he is inviting these people out of the kindness of his heart. Something is afoot here."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Speaking of which, I was able to uncover some new information myself. It would seem most sightings of the Scarlet Snout occurred by the river."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"I suspect it would be relatively easy to spot him if we staked out the area. And yet, I am hesitant to go myself. I have been asking around for so long now that it is likely that our suspect knows me, and is taking pains to avoid me."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"While I am loath to impose upon your kindness, might I ask you to take care of this alone? I promise that I will be watching from a safe distance, and will not hesitate to lend a helping hand should you need it."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Oh, thank you ever so much! Now, we've no time to lose. Let us hurry along to the riverbank─yes, right by the Leatherworkers' Guild should give us a good vantage point."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"I will keep watch from here to ensure that the Scarlet Snout does not try any funny business."},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"(-???-)Say there, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">missy</span><span class=\"alternative\">mister</span></span>..."},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"(-???-)No, not there. Here! Over here!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"(-Scarlet Snout-)Greetings, my friend! It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"(-Scarlet Snout-)Oh, dear me... Why the cold reception? Surely my appearance doesn't <span class=\"emphasis\">frighten</span> you..."},{"name":"Q2","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A2","text":"I've heard some dodgy rumors about you."},{"name":"A2","text":"Actually..."},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"(-Scarlet Snout-)Dodgy? Me? There must be some mistake. I'm sure whoever told you those things simply had the wrong end of the stick."},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"(-Scarlet Snout-)Truly? But how could that be? Why, I dress like this so I can bring laughter and levity to one and all!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"But where are my manners? I should introduce myself. I am Papa Gruff, a humble clown. Would you care to share your name with me?"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>? Such a pleasant name─brings a smile right to my face. Oh, it feels like we're thick as thieves already!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"But how to commemorate our newfound friendship? Oh, but of course! Why don't you join me at my humble abode for a feast? I swear, you haven't lived until you've been to one of my banquets!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"I ask only one favor: you are to tell <span class=\"emphasis\">no one</span> about this. It wouldn't do if some random stranger barged in on a gathering of friends, yes? And should I find out you have gone against my wishes, well..."},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"Ah, but I jest! That's what I do, you see? I wouldn't dream of harming even a flea! You have nothing to worry about. Nothing at all!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"Anyroad, come meet me under the Bentbranch Meadows bridge whenever you're ready, and I'd be more than happy to show you the way to my home. Well, ta ta for now!"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"So that was our man, was it? I must say, his appearance was every bit as...distinctive as the rumors said. Pray tell, did he invite you to his feast as he did the others?"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"...I had a feeling this was how things might play out. While his actions are most suspicious, it is impossible to tell exactly what his goal is, and whether or not he has any malicious intent."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"I suppose our best option is to play along for the time being. Might I ask you to head to Bentbranch Meadows and observe things from a safe distance? If it seems the Snout is up to no good, we'll put a stop to it straightaway."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"I myself shall first return to the Adventurers' Guild in order to deliver my report. Let us rendezvous at our destination when we both are ready."},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"This location should afford you a good vantage point of the precise location the Scarlet Snout gave you. Observe from a distance in the hope that he reveals himself."},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"Ah, welcome, welcome, one and all! It is with great pleasure that I welcome you here today!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"Er, perhaps that's a bit too formal for the occasion. Let's try this again. Ahem! My friends, welcome to the House of Gruff! By all means, make yourselves at home!"},{"name":"PIERROTMOTHER","text":"(-???-)What the heck are you carrying on about over here? I could hear you from malms away!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"My beloved wife! What brings you here?"},{"name":"PIERROTMOTHER","text":"What brings me here? Why, our dear son and I were worrying you might burst a lung screaming like this!"},{"name":"PIERROTCHILD","text":"Oh, Papa! Mumsy has told me all about the party. I can't wait to meet all of your new friends!"},{"name":"PIERROTMOTHER","text":"Yes, darling. I'm sure it's going to be an absolutely splendid time."},{"name":"PIERROTMOTHER","text":"No doubt your father here has invited sheer <span class=\"emphasis\">multitudes</span> of illustrious guests. Isn't that so, Papa?"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"B-But of course, my sweet! Don't you worry─I can assure you the event will be quite the spectacle."},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"Heh. Just think of all those innocent fools sauntering casually to our abode...blissfully unaware that they are, in fact, marching towards their doom."},{"name":"PIERROTMOTHER","text":"Oh, how I love seeing the terror on their faces when they realize their fates! It is truly to die for─quite literally for them!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"Yes, and with the fear we've extracted from the depths of their very souls, we can summon forth our fiendish friends and hold the banquet of our dreams: the Night of Devilry shall finally be upon us!"},{"name":"PIERROTCHILD","text":"The Night of Devilry? Is that something fun?"},{"name":"PIERROTMOTHER","text":"It will be the most fun you've had, little one. Admittedly, I have yet to experience it myself, but I've heard enough of the legends to know it will not disappoint!"},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"Anyroad, our honored vict─er, <span class=\"emphasis\">guests</span> are scheduled to arrive any moment now. Head back to the venue, my dear family. I shall return anon."},{"name":"MARKE","text":"How fascinating. Yes, most fascinating indeed..."},{"name":"PIERROTFATHER","text":"Hm? Oh! It's you! My apologies, but I've not quite yet finished preparing for the festivities. Pray come back a bit later."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Back from Bentbranch, are you? Pray tell me─what exactly did you witness there?"},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Good gods! This sounds like a plot most foul indeed."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"Fortunately, help is at hand. Upon hearing my report, the guild saw fit to dispatch an expert in matters of the occult to aid us in getting to the bottom of this."},{"name":"INVESTIGATOR03995","text":"I'm most certain he will be able to help us come up with an effective way to thwart the Snout's villainy. Let me know when you are ready, and I shall introduce you to him."}],"reward":{"gil":698},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":15,"id":1}],"questsType":"any","quests":[65781,66211]},"next":[70056]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1035245","obj":{"i":1035245,"n":"Adventurers' Guild Investigator","l":53,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1035252","obj":{"i":1035252,"n":"Adventurers' Guild Investigator","l":54,"q":2}},{"type":"quest","id":"65781","obj":{"i":65781,"n":"It's Probably Pirates","g":1,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":91}},{"type":"quest","id":"66211","obj":{"i":66211,"n":"It's Probably Pirates","g":0,"l":"Limsa Lominsa","s":91}},{"type":"quest","id":"70056","obj":{"i":70056,"n":"A Feast to Remember","g":203,"l":"Central Shroud","s":219,"f":1}}]}
