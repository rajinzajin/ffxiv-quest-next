I mean, I was still surprised, but I've never once doubted his judgment. None of us have. If he thought Lyse was the best choice, then she is."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"(When did <span class=\"emphasis\">Lyse</span> become leader of the Resistance? That...that is... Hm. I suppose we have Hien to thank for this too.)"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I understand M'naago's concern. If they were to lose another leader so soon after losing Conrad, it would be devastating."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"(More than a keeper, she needs a friend now. Stay close to her.)"},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"One can but wonder how the rank and file of the XIIth Legion will view their leadership upon hearing about the fate of Specula Imperatoris."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"Grim though it is, the conjurers have had no choice but to impose a rigid triage system when treating the wounded. Under the circumstances, we have to be realistic."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"Mark my words: when this is over, I will take the heads of every officer in Castrum Abania. I'll swing the bloody axe myself if I have to!"},{"name":"ARENVALD","text":"I still can't believe it. Conrad, and so many others, dead. It's not right, what those bastards did... It's not right."},{"name":"VMAHTIA","text":"You wouldn't believe the two fools we caught skulking about in imperial uniforms. It felt good handing them over to the Alliance...though it all feels pointless now."},{"name":"JMOLDVA","text":"Conrad always treated us with kindness and respect. His death will not go unavenged."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"There's no time to lose, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! General Aldynn needs to know what we saw!"},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"I'm relieved the two of you made it back in one piece. I mean, I always am, but it's a little different now, isn't it?"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"You look like you've got something important to say..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Well? Did you learn anything of value?"},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"So long as the imperials hold Castrum Abania, we will not be able to march on Ala Mhigo."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"We have lost so many men already... If we suffer another defeat like that, this campaign is over."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"We will have our retribution. It is but a matter of time."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"You are returned. I only hope you bring good news."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We scaled the cliffs of <span class=\"emphasis\">Nyunkrepf's Hope</span> and spied smoke rising from Castrum Abania's main cannon."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I think Marshal Tarupin's right─they didn't fire again because they couldn't. The cannon seems to have been disabled somehow."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Then we must attack Castrum Abania at once!"},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Hm. It could still be a trick. But if it isn't, we may not get a better opportunity."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Bluntly, General, if it <span class=\"emphasis\">is</span> a trick, it is an utterly baffling stratagem. Had the imperials wished to wipe us out, they could simply have kept firing."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Be that as it may, we need not risk everything to seize it. I say we dispatch a small contingent to infiltrate the castrum and secure control of the weapon."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"If the enemy is preoccupied with repairs, we may be able to take them unawares. If, on the other hand, it is indeed a trick, our token force will prove an elusive target─and we will at least know the cannon is operational."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Either way, it seems well worth the risk. But how are we to infiltrate the castrum?"},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"...In anticipation of a day such as this, men and women under my command have labored long to cultivate a network of informants throughout Gyr Abania─including Radiata."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Radiata is home to many who hold menial positions at Castrum Abania and other nearby installations. With the aid of our allies there, I believe we can secure a route into the fortress."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"The Resistance will handle this. You may have recruited these informants, but they'll be just as happy working with fellow Ala Mhigans. And at the end of the day, it's our land─our responsibility. Let us do right by Conrad."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"I should be glad to accompany her, General─as would Alisaie and <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, I am sure."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Well then. If you are all in agreement, I see no reason to refuse you."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"We will make ready to march on Castrum Abania. Go, and may Rhalgr watch over and keep you."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Had Alphinaud not volunteered you, I would have asked. If anyone can see this mission through, it's you."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Thanks for standing by me, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Together, we'll make Conrad proud!"},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"...I suspect a handpicked contingent of the Ala Mhigan Brigade's finest would have been equally, if not more, qualified...but what do I know."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Perhaps you recall the night we first met outside the Sil'dihn ruins, under such unfortunate circumstances? I had just returned from a meeting with my Ala Mhigan agents. As I said before, we have been preparing for this day."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"We have lost so many men already... If we suffer another defeat like that, this campaign is over."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"We will have our retribution. It is but a matter of time."},{"name":"MNAAGO","text":"Hm! I knew the Alliance had spies in Gyr Abania, but in Radiata? Impressive..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"My apologies for speaking on your behalf. It would seem my sister's <span class=\"emphasis\">forthright</span> manner is rubbing off on me... I confess, my decision to volunteer was not wholly motived by concern for Lyse, nor less Ala Mhigo."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"...Castrum Abania is the largest imperial facility in the Peaks, you see, and so the likelihood that Krile is being held captive there is quite high..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Dealing with that cannon remains our main objective, of course, but if there is even a chance that Krile might be rescued in the process, I would never forgive myself if I did not take it."}],"reward":{"gil":631,"items":[{"id":18657,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18659,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18663,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18670,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5723,"one":1}],"xp":232200},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":142}],"quests":[68076]},"next":[68078,68375,68376,68377,68378,68379,68380,68381]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1020633","obj":{"i":1020633,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020629","obj":{"i":1020629,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020604","obj":{"i":1020604,"n":"Raubahn","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020628","obj":{"i":1020628,"n":"M'naago","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020630","obj":{"i":1020630,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":6}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020631","obj":{"i":1020631,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":4}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020632","obj":{"i":1020632,"n":"Pipin","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020638","obj":{"i":1020638,"n":"Serpent Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020639","obj":{"i":1020639,"n":"Storm Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022339","obj":{"i":1022339,"n":"Arenvald","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022340","obj":{"i":1022340,"n":"V'mah Tia","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022341","obj":{"i":1022341,"n":"J'moldva","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"item","id":"18657","obj":{"i":18657,"n":"Molybdenum Longsword","l":285,"c":30566,"t":2,"p":26376}},{"type":"item","id":"18659","obj":{"i":18659,"n":"Molybdenum War Axe","l":285,"c":31538,"t":3,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18663","obj":{"i":18663,"n":"Molybdenum Longblade","l":285,"c":34291,"t":87,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18670","obj":{"i":18670,"n":"Molybdenum Uchigatana","l":285,"c":36404,"t":96,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"5723","obj":{"i":5723,"n":"Quicktongue Materia V","l":160,"c":20259,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Spell Speed","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68076","obj":{"i":68076,"n":"Above the Churning Waters","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1000}},{"type":"quest","id":"68078","obj":{"i":68078,"n":"With Tired Hands We Toil","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1020}},{"type":"quest","id":"68375","obj":{"i":68375,"n":"Live off the Land","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8140}},{"type":"quest","id":"68376","obj":{"i":68376,"n":"Runs in the Family","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8150}},{"type":"quest","id":"68377","obj":{"i":68377,"n":"Those Boys of Mine","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8160}},{"type":"quest","id":"68378","obj":{"i":68378,"n":"Out of Sight","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8170,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68379","obj":{"i":68379,"n":"Public Opinion","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8180}},{"type":"quest","id":"68380","obj":{"i":68380,"n":"Dragged through the Mud","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8190}},{"type":"quest","id":"68381","obj":{"i":68381,"n":"Second Chances","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8200}}]}
