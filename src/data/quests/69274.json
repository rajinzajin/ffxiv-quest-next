Plans for the revelry are proceeding apace...or so the ushi bugyo thought. The pounding of rice for advent cakes should be nearing completion─assuming it has not already finished─and yet there has been nary a word from the pounding site. Fearing something has gone amiss, the ushi bugyo asks you to investigate in his stead.<br><br>※Please note that you will be unable to complete this quest after the seasonal event has ended. For details, please check the Lodestone.","You arrive at the site to find sentient mochi, and judging by its seemingly disgruntled disposition, it has developed a desire to deal out poundings rather than take them. After much hacking, slashing, and all manner of beatings reminiscent of pounding, the mochi at last grows still, its remains the perfect size to roll into advent cakes. The ushi bugyo is certain to take an interest in your unorthodox methods of preparing this traditional treat of the Far East.","The ushi bugyo is both shocked and relieved to hear of what took place at the pounding site. With a delivery of advent cakes no doubt on their way, the delegate musters the courage to ask one last favor of you. Assuming you are up to the task, he asks you confer with him again for the finer details of his plan."],"objectives":["Complete the FATE “The Mochi that Ate Vylbrand” in middle La Noscea.","Speak with the ushi bugyo in Limsa Lominsa."],"dialogue":[{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"Excuse me, <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">sir</span></span>, but are you by chance an adventurer? Yes, only one so well traveled would dress in such a peculiar manner... Though I suppose some might argue it is my garbs which make for a spectacle in these lands."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"Ahem, perhaps introductions are in order before I give further offense. I am the ushi bugyo, and I am come from the Far East to share with these good people the traditions of Heavensturn."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"The Eorzeans believe that, at year's end, the gods choose one among their number to serve next as a herald of good fortune, is that right? In the Far East, it is not a god, but one of twelve great beasts that is chosen."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"And this year it is the mighty ushi! I believe the locals here know it as an ox? If you are unfamiliar with this most sacred of animals, you need but look upon the resplendent figure adorning my kabuto."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"Indeed, Heavensturn is a most wondrous celebration, the capstone of our festivities being the pounding of rice."},{"name":"Q1","text":"What will you say?"},{"name":"A1","text":"You mean mochi, yes? I've pounded my fair share."},{"name":"A1","text":"Rice is to be boiled, sir. Not pounded."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"Ah, a <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">woman</span><span class=\"alternative\">man</span></span> of culture, I see. I have heard you adventurers are a worldly sort, and you are most certainly living up to your reputation."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"<span class=\"emphasis\">Boiled</span>? Surely you mean steamed. How else is it to gain its fluffy, sticky texture? It is that selfsame quality that allows us to make advent cakes. You see, once the rice is steamed, we place it into a large mortar, then beat the rice into a sticky dough. A seemingly monotonous way of cooking, but I assure you it can be quite fun, and the end result is a most delectable treat."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"Wishing to make the most of this momentous occasion, we received permission from the Adventurer's Guild to have the rice pounded not by a cyclops but a Gozu, which bears a striking resemblance to the divine beast which heralds the coming year."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"Everything appeared to be proceeding apace, but the pounding was set to begin ages ago, and not even a morsel of mochi has found its way here."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"When last I spoke with the mochi daikan, he assured me the pounding was nearly complete. Something has gone amiss. I am certain of it."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"<span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">Dear madam</span><span class=\"alternative\">Good sir</span></span>, might I prevail upon you to go and visit the pounding site?

It would appear Wakamaru here wishes to accompany you."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"Though but a young calf, Wakamaru is surprisingly astute.

I pray your journey is an uneventful one."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"You are returned. But what of the mochi daikan? And where is Wakamaru?"},{"name":"RICECAKEREEVE","text":"We are here ushi bugyo, and none the worse for wear, all things considered."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"Beset by sentient mochi? Having swallowed this year's reserves, mortar and all, I can but imagine what a terrible creature you faced."},{"name":"RICECAKEREEVE","text":"Would that this were the only time it was necessary to overcome such travails."},{"name":"RICECAKEREEVE","text":"No doubt you remember last year's celebration of the rat, and the monster borne from the waters of Daitenzan's soulspring?"},{"name":"RICECAKEREEVE","text":"I believe a sliver of that mochi monstrosity somehow survived. How it found its way to our supplies is anyone's guess."},{"name":"RICECAKEREEVE","text":"During last year's celebration of the rat, we thought to use the waters of Daitenzan's soulspring in the making of our mochi. Much to our dismay, this resulted in not a delicacy, but a dreadful beast unlike anything we had ever seen."},{"name":"RICECAKEREEVE","text":"Though we thought it destroyed, I believe a sliver of that mochi monstrosity somehow survived. How it found its way to our supplies is anyone's guess."},{"name":"CUWMISSIONARY","text":"But that is neither here nor there.
