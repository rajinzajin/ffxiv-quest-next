This popular wine was once abundant in Wineport, but most stores were destroyed during the Calamity. However, rumor has it that one of the resident vignerons may be keeping a secret cache. Speak with the vignerons and see if there is any truth to these tales.","Alas, the vignerons reiterate that there is no point in searching for Bacchus wine. You must once again bear the bad news back to Shamani Lohmani.","Even though he knew it was a ridiculous idea, Shamani Lohmani is still saddened to hear that no one in town has a bottle of Bacchus wine. He also admits that he has a personal preference for the drink, as it rekindled his love of fine spirits and helped him to find a new direction in life. With both his plans foiled, the blind vintner begins contemplating how to best approach the situation."],"objectives":["Speak with the vignerons.","Speak with Shamani Lohmani."],"dialogue":[{"name":"SHAMANILOHMANI","text":"There is a chance, however small, that another resident of Wineport can furnish us with a suitable wine.

The only breeds cultivated these days are common lowland vines. Which isn't to say that their grapes are of poor quality─only that we have known better."},{"name":"SHAMANILOHMANI","text":"Long ago, the vignerons of Wineport crossbred several species, and produced a grape-bearing vine of never-before-seen quality."},{"name":"SHAMANILOHMANI","text":"Bacchus grapes were once the pride of this town, as they were used to produce vintages which surpassed all others."},{"name":"SHAMANILOHMANI","text":"This includes the most aromatic, the most complex, the most flavorful of <span class=\"emphasis\">all</span> wines─aye, the legendary Bacchus wines were born right here in Wineport!"},{"name":"SHAMANILOHMANI","text":"Ahem.
