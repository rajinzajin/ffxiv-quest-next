It looks more like a work camp..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Nary a soldier in sight. Mayhap they were recalled to Castrum Abania..."},{"name":"PIPIN","text":"Perhaps you recall the night we first met outside the Sil'dihn ruins, under such unfortunate circumstances? I had just returned from a meeting with my Ala Mhigan agents. As I said before, we have been preparing for this day."},{"name":"SERPENTOFFICER","text":"We have lost so many men already... If we suffer another defeat like that, this campaign is over."},{"name":"STORMOFFICER","text":"We will have our retribution. It is but a matter of time."},{"name":"RAUBAHN","text":"Had Alphinaud not volunteered you, I would have asked. If anyone can see this mission through, it's you."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Alphinaud said we were looking for a Roegadyn woman, right? And that we should answer her question with “courage”?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"I suppose we'll just have to strike up a conversation with every one of them until we find our contact. Let me know if you find her, and I'll do the same."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"Hmm...she has to be around here somewhere..."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"So as I was saying, about this woman..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Any luck? No? Me neither..."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"...Ain't seen you around before.

'Cause I don't. Piss off."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"Oh aye? I'll bet you are. Best of luck to you, soldier."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"...Courage, you say? Well, that's in short supply these days. Better to keep your head down and go along to survive."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"Call me a coward too, if you like, 'cause I'll not speak on it more─at least not here."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"Outside Radiata, behind those barricades over yonder, on the other hand..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Hey. Was that who I think it was?"},{"name":"LYSE","text":"Well, that's a relief─or a trap. Either way, I'll find Alphinaud and Alisaie. We'll meet you there."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"Not followed, were you? Good."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"That all of you, is it? Let's get to it, then. Name yourselves."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We are the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. Friends of Marshal Tarupin."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"(-Stark Woad-)Name's Stark. Stark Woad. The rest you know, or we wouldn't be here."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"(-Stark Woad-)This is about Specula Imperatoris and the cannon, isn't it?"},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Just so. Can you tell us what happened?"},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"(-Stark Woad-)Aye. I overheard soldiers talking while working in the mess. The ceruleum pipeline fueling the cannon was destroyed by an unidentified male insurgent, they said."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"One man single-handedly disabled the cannon? That beggars belief!"},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"(-Stark Woad-)Nevertheless, that's what they said. It took a while, but they've finally put the fires out, and the engineers have been working day and night to repair it."},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"(-Stark Woad-)Wish I could tell you more, but the incident had everyone jumping at shadows and afraid to say much more. To make matters worse, the Ala Mhigan help have been sent home indefinitely."},{"name":"ALISAIE","text":"So the cannon could already be fully operational..."},{"name":"LYSE","text":"We need to sneak inside Castrum Abania to ensure the cannon is no longer a threat to our troops. Can you help us?"},{"name":"STARKWOAD","text":"(-Stark Woad-)Aye, that much I can do. I've pieced together a map of the interior over the years, and I know for a fact that there are multiple points of entry."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"Impressive...<br>If we split into several groups, that may improve our odds of reaching the fire control center."},{"name":"ALPHINAUD","text":"We may be few in number, but I have faith that we can see this through!"}],"reward":{"gil":631,"items":[{"id":18658,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18660,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18662,"one":1,"hq":1},{"id":18672,"one":1,"hq":1},{"num":3,"id":5723,"one":1}],"xp":232200},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":68,"id":142}],"quests":[68078]},"next":[68080,68385,68386,68387,68388,68389,68390,68391,68392]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1022344","obj":{"i":1022344,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020645","obj":{"i":1020645,"n":"Young Hellsguard","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020604","obj":{"i":1020604,"n":"Raubahn","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020632","obj":{"i":1020632,"n":"Pipin","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020636","obj":{"i":1020636,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":3}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020637","obj":{"i":1020637,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":2}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020638","obj":{"i":1020638,"n":"Serpent Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020639","obj":{"i":1020639,"n":"Storm Officer","l":2407,"q":9}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020640","obj":{"i":1020640,"n":"Alphinaud","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020641","obj":{"i":1020641,"n":"Alisaie","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1020642","obj":{"i":1020642,"n":"Young Hellsguard","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"npc","id":"1022345","obj":{"i":1022345,"n":"Lyse","l":2407,"q":1}},{"type":"item","id":"18658","obj":{"i":18658,"n":"Molybdenum Knuckles","l":285,"c":31128,"t":1,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18660","obj":{"i":18660,"n":"Molybdenum Trident","l":285,"c":31939,"t":5,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18662","obj":{"i":18662,"n":"Molybdenum Daggers","l":285,"c":33918,"t":84,"p":39564}},{"type":"item","id":"18672","obj":{"i":18672,"n":"Molybdenum Kite Shield","l":285,"c":30154,"t":11,"p":13188}},{"type":"item","id":"5723","obj":{"i":5723,"n":"Quicktongue Materia V","l":160,"c":20259,"t":58,"materia":{"tier":4,"value":6,"attr":"Spell Speed","category":0}}},{"type":"quest","id":"68078","obj":{"i":68078,"n":"With Tired Hands We Toil","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1020}},{"type":"quest","id":"68080","obj":{"i":68080,"n":"The Price of Freedom","g":6,"l":"The Peaks","s":1040}},{"type":"quest","id":"68385","obj":{"i":68385,"n":"Shimmer in the Scales","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8210}},{"type":"quest","id":"68386","obj":{"i":68386,"n":"Radiata Stores","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8220}},{"type":"quest","id":"68387","obj":{"i":68387,"n":"A Hunger for Trade","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8240,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68388","obj":{"i":68388,"n":"Give Them the Evil Eye","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8250}},{"type":"quest","id":"68389","obj":{"i":68389,"n":"Explosive Profits","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8260}},{"type":"quest","id":"68390","obj":{"i":68390,"n":"Jhammel and Hide","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8230}},{"type":"quest","id":"68391","obj":{"i":68391,"n":"Critical Moss","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8270}},{"type":"quest","id":"68392","obj":{"i":68392,"n":"Foper Faux Pas","g":105,"l":"The Peaks","s":8280}}]}
