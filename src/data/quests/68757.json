You can choose.","After sparing a few moments to chat about your extraordinary adventures in the First, Sidurgu informs you that he has come into possession of an anonymous letter addressed to you. Out of respect for your privacy, he has refrained from opening it, and after he takes his leave to chase after a rather annoyed Rielle, you are left alone to read it.<br><br>But if you're reading <span class=\"emphasis\">this</span>, then you know how the story goes, don't you? So now comes the choice: hold the crystal close that we may enjoy these moments together. Or put it away and pretend I was never a part of it. That I was never really here.","\"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename Surname</span>,<br>You'll forgive me for the sudden correspondence, and the secrecy. You helped me, in a way. Once upon a time. It's past time I said as much, and so...here we are.<br>Feels like a lifetime ago, come to think on it. You've been through quite a lot since then─accomplished incredible things. I'd like to think that, in some way, I was a part of your journey... Far from the best, no doubt. But for me and my own journey, I think it safe to say that you've been...well. There's no suitable words to describe it, really.<br>I've done things. Made decisions. Looking back, I can't help but feel more than a little foolish. But such is life, and we have to seize what few opportunities we have for closure...even if it is through the written word and not face–to–face.<br>So wherever you are, I hope you're happy. Still fighting, still adventuring─still doing what you love. Be well.“<br><br><span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">The cryptic letter speaks for itself. Perhaps Lunnie, the woman who delivered it to Sidurgu, might be able to shed light on this mystery─or at least help you to go through the motions and put one foot in front of the other. Over and over again. Off you trot.</span><span class=\"alternative\">The cryptic letter speaks for itself. Perhaps Lunnie, the woman who delivered it to Sidurgu, might be able to shed light on this mystery...</span></span>","Lunnie, it turns out, is none other than the girl you rescued from the clutches of corrupt Temple Knights a lifetime ago. She is not, however, the author of the letter, and explains that she received it from one Ser Patrounade, who stated it was to be delivered to the hero of the Scions. It would seem a visit to the Congregation is in order.<br><br>She didn't know, of course. How could she? She's not even sure how many of you there were that day. Are you? But never you mind that. You have a search to continue.","Ser Patrounade was no more than another link in the chain, having received the letter from Orella of Rhalgr's Reach. He, like you, had been injured at the Ghimlyt Dark, and so he spent some nights there convalescing in her care. If further answers are to be found, it will be at the Barber.<br><br>Do you remember Ser Patrounade? I do. Not by name, of course─he didn't have one when the tower fell. That's how these things so often go─you do your bit, only later to fill in the gaps, to piece together the picture in distant hindsight. What will your legacy be tomorrow, and the day after, and in the days after that...?","After clarifying that you are come not in search of a lost child yet again, Orella explains to you that the letter came with a shipment of medical supplies from Little Ala Mhigo. She can only assume that the author intended for Commander Hext to take charge of it and deliver it to you personally. And so you depart for southern Thanalan to retrace another leg of the letter's journey.<br><br>And Orella's just another step in your own journey. Will you remember her? What about the names in her ledger─Conrad Kemp? Meffrid Noward? “Ah, but they were doomed from the first,” a part of you whispers. “Inevitable deaths on the road to a foregone conclusion,” sayeth the hardened heart, in retrospect. You'd be wrong, of course. It never had to be this way. This world is exactly as we choose to make it.","Gundobald regards you thoughtfully and states that the letter speaks for itself, which is why he agreed to send it on the author's behalf. However, if you are unwilling to let it lie─if you still seek answers and closure, he will not deny you. There is a man at the Red Rooster Stead in lower La Noscea that may be able to help you find a measure of peace.<br><br>Now Gundobald, he's seen you at your best and at your worst. He's seen you when you were one and when you were two. He could tell you someone else wrote the letter, if that's what you'd like to believe. It'd be a turn, sure, but we've seen stranger things. Or he could continue to regard you with that same mixture of concern and fear that bubbles to the surface when the topic of us comes up, and say nothing of the sort. And you─you could go to Red Rooster Stead, with the answer of your choosing. See if it's all to your satisfaction.","The man at the Red Rooster Stead turns out to be yet another figure from your past, a former merchant who bade you retrieve his stolen wares and berated you for the condition in which you returned them to him. Ever since that fateful day, his life has been a succession of failures...until, while going through his meager possessions, he chanced to find a bloodstained package of flower bulbs from once upon a time. Thereafter he resolved to become a botanist and start anew, and as a humble token of his appreciation, long overdue, he offers a flower. But it is not for you.<br><br>Another nameless face, now named. Then conniving, now humbled─as well he should be, no? I gave him a right talking to─or you did. Your choice. And after a string of bad luck, he's since turned over a new leaf...and found a flower. Suitable for funerals and farewells. I told you before you know how the story goes, didn't I? Come and see, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>. Come and see.","You say a few words, and offer a flower in memory of...a memory. Now go, and don't look back.<br><br>It's been a long, strange journey, filled with all kinds of ups and downs. <span class=\"emphasis\">Your</span> journey, to be sure, but like I wrote before, I'd like to pretend I was an important part of it. Vanity, aye─but how can I not think of legacy, now, when we've been to the First and witnessed firsthand the lengths to which man will go to be remembered? I want to believe─I <span class=\"emphasis\">need</span> to believe that this was not for nothing. That I changed you for the better, as you changed me...","Sidurgu is waiting for you with Rielle in the Forgotten Knight when you return. He asks you what you found, what it was all for, and you reply─<br><br>Time to go. I don't know when we'll do this again─<span class=\"emphasis\">if</span> we'll ever do this again. The little trick you've learned doesn't count, you know. But even if this is our end, it won't change what we had. I love you more than you'll ever know.

Had Lunnie not recognized you from my stories, I do not know how I might have seen it to your hand..."},{"name":"PATROUNADE","text":"If you seek the author, mayhap you should pay a visit to the Reach? I know only what I told you, but surely Orella can tell you more.

You seek answers. Closure. I will not deny you this."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"At the Red Rooster Stead in lower La Noscea, you will find a man named Godeheard. Speak with him. Perhaps then you will find a measure of peace."},{"name":"GUNDOBALD","text":"...There was a time when I feared for you, divided as you were.

I say, is none of what I'm telling you ringing a bell? Really?"},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"Not even the part where I refused to thank you and demanded that you pay me restitution for the property you yourself returned to me...?"},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"Well, seeing as I've already confessed it, I may as well reiterate: it was me..."},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"That was just the beginning of my bad luck, as it happens. A string of bad decisions left me in debt to some very unforgiving fellows, and before I knew it they had taken damn near everything I owned."},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"I was friendless, penniless, hopeless. And let me tell you, running afoul of the Warrior of Light had not done me any favors either! There was a time when I couldn't help but blame you for all my misfortune..."},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"And then, one day, when I was rummaging through my meager possessions, I had an epiphany."},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"I stumbled upon a package from that shipment you recovered for me that ill-fated day. Flower bulbs─stained with Qiqirn blood, but viable for cultivation. Still brimming with the potential to grow and thrive..."},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"Before I knew it, I was cradling the package to my breast, sobbing and moaning like a mad fool..."},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"...For a fool is exactly what I had been. I had been offered a kindness without let or lien, and instead of thanking this generous hero had spat in <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">her</span><span class=\"alternative\">his</span></span> face."},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"So I left that life behind, save for the bulbs I brought with me here. Apprenticed myself to the botanists and resolved to start anew."},{"name":"GODEHEARD","text":"And wouldn't you know it, the stubborn little fiends finally bloomed for me.
