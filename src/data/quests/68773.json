We <span class=\"emphasis\">know</span> that the samiel is out there─it's left plenty of evidence of its passage. So why can't we find it?"},{"name":"YALANA","text":"&lt;huff&gt; &lt;wheeze&gt; Ch-Chief! We have a problem!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Yalana, you should know better than to run at full tilt! You're an academic─you're liable to kill yourself!"},{"name":"YALANA","text":"N-Never mind me! It's Mao─he's gone off to Il Mheg to search for the samiel...alone!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"He's what!?"},{"name":"YALANA","text":"The other researchers, they blamed him for putting the idea of the samiel into your head. “It's because of you she's chasing some fool myth,” they jeered."},{"name":"YALANA","text":"Mao couldn't bear their barbs, and in his anger, he rushed off with little more than the clothes on his back!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"There's no time to waste! We must find him before he runs afoul of the faeries!"},{"name":"YALANA","text":"B-But, Chief! What if <span class=\"emphasis\">we</span> run afoul of the faeries?"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"We'll have <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span> with us. <span class=\"alternative-container\"><span class=\"alternative\">She</span><span class=\"alternative\">He</span></span> has friends among the pixies. Isn't that right?"},{"name":"YALANA","text":"I see... Yes, we'd be much assured if you could ask the pixies of Lydha Lran after Mao's whereabouts."},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"While you see to that, Yalana and I will cast around by the entrance. Come and find us after you've made your inquiries. Now then, let us hurry!"},{"name":"PIXIE03237A","text":"The man with the big ears? Ooh, yes, I know the one! Was chasing him, as a matter of fact!"},{"name":"PIXIE03237A","text":"Unfortunately, I lost sight of him west of the lake. If I see him again, I'll turn him into a cute leafman! Tee hee!"},{"name":"PIXIE03237B","text":"What!? A mortal's come here to play!? Nobody told me that! That's not fair! I'm so bored! Bored, bored, bored! I want to play with him too!"},{"name":"PIXIE03237C","text":"Hmmm? That mortal's your friend, you say? Had I known that, I would've greeted him with a shove into the lake! Tee hee hee!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"It appears Mao-Ladd is somewhere near Longmirror Lake. Time to take word to the others, who await you at Timh Gyeus."},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"I've only dared set foot in Il Mheg a few times. The place is at once beautiful and terrifying."},{"name":"YALANA","text":"Oh, where are you, Mao?"},{"name":"PIXIE03237A","text":"I lost sight of the man with the big ears west of the lake."},{"name":"PIXIE03237A","text":"If I see him again, I'll turn him into a cute leafman! Tee hee!"},{"name":"PIXIE03237B","text":"Nobody told me about the mortal! That's not fair! I'm so bored! Bored, bored, bored! I want to play with him too!"},{"name":"PIXIE03237C","text":"Had I known that mortal was your friend, I would've greeted him with a shove into the lake! Tee hee hee!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"There you are. Were you able to learn anything about Mao's whereabouts?"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Truly? Thank you, <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! We could never have located him without your help!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Come, let's make haste to Longmirror Lake. Quickly and quietly does it..."},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"What were you thinking, lad? You could've been killed, or worse!"},{"name":"YALANA","text":"He's safe, thank goodness. It's a miracle he managed to come this far unharmed."},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>! I'm so sorry for all the trouble!"},{"name":"YALANA","text":"And so you should be! The chief alone is enough of a handful─I can't chase you down as well!"},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"B-But the others, they spoke ill of the chief. I couldn't just stand by and take it."},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"I know it was reckless of me to come out here alone...but thanks to that, I was able to find an actual part of the samiel!"},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"There's...er, just one problem─in my haste, I forgot my tools. <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you seem to have yours. Could you do the collecting in my stead?"},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"Lest you wonder, it's a shred of scaly skin. I spotted it in this area, Timh Gyeus, after noticing rub marks on the trees and rocks."},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"I spotted the skin in this area, Timh Gyeus, after noticing rub marks on the trees and rocks. Please collect it in my stead."},{"name":"YALANA","text":"While droppings can tell us much about a creature, there's no substitute for an actual piece of it. In spite of myself, I'm quite excited, I must admit!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"So, did you find the shred of skin?"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Mmm-hmmm! While it's a little on the shriveled side, this is indeed skin from the creature. It was likely molting."},{"name":"YALANA","text":"A molting creature! That's one more thing we know about it! I can't wait to see what else this specimen can tell us!"},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"The s-s-samiel! It's b-b-behind you!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Hm? I don't see anything."},{"name":"YALANA","text":"Me neither."},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"Th-That's odd... It was there just a moment ago. And its shape─I'd swear it matches that of the shadow I saw in Amh Araeng."},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"I don't know how, but it literally disappeared in the blink of an eye."},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"<span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, you saw it too, didn't you? It wasn't just my imagination?"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Truly!? It was right there, and I missed it!? Gah, of all the rotten luck!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Tell me, what did it look like? What was its color? Smell? Size?"},{"name":"YALANA","text":"Chief, perhaps we should save the questions for after we leave this place. Even with <span class=\"highlight\">Forename</span>, it may not be entirely safe for us here."},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Yes, you have the right of it. It wouldn't do to have the faeries get their hands on our precious specimen. Come, let's return to the Crystarium."},{"name":"YALANA","text":"Thank you for helping us to find Mao-Ladd. I shudder to think what may have happened to him."},{"name":"MAOLADD","text":"Anger carried my steps to Il Mheg, but it quickly gave way to terror. I'm in your debt."},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Well, that was certainly a harrowing outing, but it wasn't without fruit─in the form of a piece of the samiel itself! Ahhh, to feel the scaly texture in my hands and breathe in its mysterious smell... Pure bliss, I tell you!"},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Alas, Yalana snatched it from me before I could have a little taste..."},{"name":"QESHIRAE","text":"Well, for now we'll just have to leave her to her task. I'm sure she'll have new information for us before long, so do not wander far!"},{"name":"SYSTEM","text":"The next request will be available from Qeshi-Rae upon reaching level 78 as a miner or botanist."}],"reward":{"gil":1372,"items":[{"num":30,"id":12669}]},"reqs":{"jobs":[{"lvl":75,"id":154}],"quests":[68772]},"next":[68774]},"partials":[{"type":"npc","id":"1027236","obj":{"i":1027236,"n":"Qeshi-Rae","l":2951,"q":3}},{"type":"item","id":"12669","obj":{"i":12669,"n":"Hi-Cordial","l":100,"c":20623,"t":44}},{"type":"item","id":"26756","obj":{"i":26756,"n":"Ancient Animal Skin","l":406,"c":21814,"t":63}},{"type":"quest","id":"68772","obj":{"i":68772,"n":"On the Trail of a Myth","g":170,"l":"The Crystarium","s":410,"f":1}},{"type":"quest","id":"68774","obj":{"i":68774,"n":"The Myth Takes Form","g":170,"l":"The Crystarium","s":430}}]}
